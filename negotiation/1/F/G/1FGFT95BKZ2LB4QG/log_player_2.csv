"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $12,000 is a good price, but Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows for potential savings.** By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This is a good strategy if the negotiation with Alice fails, but it's not the ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** She's moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and the price is significantly better than buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be risky.** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. There's a risk of a stalemate, leading to the more expensive purchase from John.
* **$11,500 is a good deal.**  Bob gets a decent discount and avoids the higher price from John."
