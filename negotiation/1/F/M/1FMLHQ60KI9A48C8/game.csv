"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential value of this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to meet you halfway. This is still a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
