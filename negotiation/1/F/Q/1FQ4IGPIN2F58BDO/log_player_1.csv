Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately push him away.  It also sets a clear expectation of a price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $135, so how about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$130 is a good compromise.  It's above Bob's initial offer and below my previous counteroffer, so it's a fair deal for both of us.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and I could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
