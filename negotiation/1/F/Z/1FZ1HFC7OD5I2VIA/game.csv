"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a good margin for you and allows me to get closer to the value I'm aiming for.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
