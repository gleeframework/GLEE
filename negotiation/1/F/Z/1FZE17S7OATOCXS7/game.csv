"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500.

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and your desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11,025. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",11025.0,Alice,5,
