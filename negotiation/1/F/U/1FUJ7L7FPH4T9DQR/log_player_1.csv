Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price, $120. This way, I'm maximizing my potential profit and leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  If Bob rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $110. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations. If Bob still rejects, I might consider dropping the price a bit more, but I'll keep the option of selling to John for $120 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's higher than what Bob was initially willing to pay.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for the same price."
