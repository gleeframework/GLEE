"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is well below your maximum price of $12,000.  Accepting it allows you to save $2,000 and there's no reason to risk losing the deal by trying to negotiate further."
