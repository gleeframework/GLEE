This offer starts with a relatively high price, giving you room to negotiate. I've included a friendly message to build rapport and pique Bob's interest.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $120. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price."
