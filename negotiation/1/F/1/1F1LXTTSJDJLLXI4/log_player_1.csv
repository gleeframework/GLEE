Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially counteroffer, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product and offered a price significantly closer to my initial offer than his perceived value. There's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $110, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above the midpoint between his offer ($105) and my previous ask ($115). 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This counteroffer still secures me a $10 profit above my minimum sale price. 
* **Pressure:** Bob is aware I have an alternative buyer. By holding firm, I'm subtly reminding him of the potential of losing the deal if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer, Alice.  How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Accepting $108 still gives me an $8 profit above my minimum, which is a good outcome.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing the sale now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
