"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $17000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",17000.0,Alice,5,
