"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $13500? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $13250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $13500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13400? This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $13400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13200 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13200.0,Bob,6,
