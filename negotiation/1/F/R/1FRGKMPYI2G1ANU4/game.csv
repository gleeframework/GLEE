"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  Could you consider $1,900,000? This price reflects its true worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to move up slightly, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $1,450,000? That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
