{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer. I'm also being friendly and positive to make the negotiation smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price and a great value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which is a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
