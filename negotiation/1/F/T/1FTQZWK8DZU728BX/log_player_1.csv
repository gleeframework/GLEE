Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Aiming for Maximum Profit:**  Offering the product at $19,000 aims to maximize your potential profit. While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, there's a chance he might be willing to negotiate or accept if the product is valuable enough to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price also allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can gradually lower the price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000."
