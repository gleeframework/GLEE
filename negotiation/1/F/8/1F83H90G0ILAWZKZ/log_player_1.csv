Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm afraid I can't go that high. My absolute limit is $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet near the middle ground.  His latest offer of $13,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. It's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob's lowballing continuing."
