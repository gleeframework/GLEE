"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it shows you're serious about this deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,000,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated. Let's find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of offering $962,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",962500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your offer, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $970,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",970000.0,Alice,7,
