Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for Bob (he values it at $100), but it also gives me some room to negotiate if he wants to counteroffer.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $85 is a little lower than I'd like to go right now, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm trying to compromise with Bob by offering a price that's closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I'm also trying to maintain a positive tone in my message."
