Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification for value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to *both* of us, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I'm aiming high, the phrase ""Let me know what you think"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a potentially even better deal."
