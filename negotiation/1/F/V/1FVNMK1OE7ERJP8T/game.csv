"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value to me is also $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
