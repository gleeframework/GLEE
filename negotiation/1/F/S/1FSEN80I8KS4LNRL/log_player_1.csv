Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a bit. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly justifies the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or potentially sell it to John), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, prompting Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price slightly downward, but remember your minimum of $12,000."
