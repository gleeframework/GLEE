Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm framing the price as fair in relation to its value to Bob, hoping to appeal to his rational side. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open question to invite Bob to start the negotiation process. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to be open to negotiation and avoid a potential stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  $1,000,000 is still a good profit for me, but I believe the product is worth more to Bob, given he initially offered $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but it limits my potential gains. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a better deal without risking a complete loss. 

I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but offering a counter-offer to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that my proposed price is ""fair"" to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Keeping Pressure:** I'm avoiding a definitive ""no"" to leave the door open for further negotiation if Bob rejects my offer again.

This counter-offer is a calculated move to maintain control of the negotiation while also showing flexibility and a genuine desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal:**  $1,050,000 is only $50,000 away from my initial counter-offer of $1,100,000. This is a good outcome considering my minimum value is $800,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be lengthy and may not yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting my offer again or walking away completely is too high. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate would cost time and energy, potentially causing me to miss out on other opportunities.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale, minimizing the risk of losing a valuable customer and allowing me to move on to other ventures."
