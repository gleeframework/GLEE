# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob and Alice is asking for $15,000, so it is not a good deal.  Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable to me.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,000?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay and he can still get the product from John for $10,000.  Bob should counteroffer again."
