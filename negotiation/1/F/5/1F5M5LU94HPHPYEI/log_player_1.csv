Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $140 is more than your minimum of $120, so you'll still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Since Bob values the product at $150, there's potential for him to counteroffer and still give you a good price. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting with a slightly lower price than what you believe it's worth, you show Bob that you're open to negotiation and might be willing to lower the price further.

Keep in mind, this is just the initial offer. You will have to be flexible and adapt your negotiation strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While you want to make a sale, it's not worth it to accept such a low price. You're better off:

* **Rejecting his offer:** This signals that you're not desperate for a sale and are willing to stand your ground. 
* **Making a counteroffer:** You can propose a price somewhere between $110 and your initial offer of $140. This shows you're willing to compromise, but still value your product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best option for you.  Here's why:

* **Bob's offer meets your minimum:** You were willing to sell to John for $120, so accepting Bob's offer means you achieve your minimum desired profit.
* **You have no guarantee of a better offer:** While you could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. It's possible he'll walk away, leaving you with nothing.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and move on."
