Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will gain by purchasing the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is expected in a negotiation.
* **Back-up plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not overly aggressive in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity to counter:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price from Bob. 
* **No immediate urgency:**  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I don't need to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a slight concession to show I'm willing to negotiate but not sacrificing too much.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm framing the $9,000 price as a significant discount from my initial offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Clear signal:**  This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about selling to Bob but still value the product above his current offer. 
* **Finality:**  While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm positioning this as my best possible price."
