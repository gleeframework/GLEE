Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer, as close to John's price as possible, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to my limit. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,500,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a fair deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While I could continue to counteroffer,  it's getting closer to my limit and I don't want to risk going over.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is the safer option."
