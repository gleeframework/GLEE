"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While $600,000 is significantly below its value, I understand we may have some room for negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we agree on $800,000? This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
