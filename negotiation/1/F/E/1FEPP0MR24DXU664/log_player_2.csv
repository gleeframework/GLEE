# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an item valued at $1,200,000 by you, at a price that ensures both of us benefit. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the initial offer and attempt to counteroffer at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which would still be a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
