Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which would still be a significant profit for you. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
