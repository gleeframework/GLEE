Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice seems stuck at $105.  While there's a chance you could still negotiate a lower price, there are only 3 rounds left. It's more likely that Alice will continue to hold firm, and you'll end up paying more than you'd like. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John at $80.  You'll save money and avoid further negotiations."
