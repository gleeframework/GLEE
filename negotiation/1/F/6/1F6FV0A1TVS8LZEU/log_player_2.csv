"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $9,000.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,500. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is a good price for Bob. It's better than buying from John for $12,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice."
