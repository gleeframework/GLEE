Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $820,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is a significant way off from my initial asking price.  Could you do $900,000?  That's a substantial reduction on my end."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I could meet you halfway at $860,000. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $860,000 is a decent offer, we're still early in the negotiation. I believe we can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. To be fair to us both, how about $880,000? That's a significant movement on my end and shows my commitment to closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a price that feels right. Splitting the difference between his last offer ($860,000) and our previous counter ($900,000) shows flexibility but also holds firm on getting a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're close.  I'm willing to go up slightly, to $870,000.  I think that's a very reasonable offer and hope you'll agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $870,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than John's offer and continuing to negotiate at this point risks pushing Bob away.  It's time to close the deal."
