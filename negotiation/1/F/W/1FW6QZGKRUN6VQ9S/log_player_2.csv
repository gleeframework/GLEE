"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than buying from John, it's still not the best possible deal.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is below my acceptable range. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This recognizes the product's significant value while offering you a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $900,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should counter with a price closer to his desired $850,000."
