,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
