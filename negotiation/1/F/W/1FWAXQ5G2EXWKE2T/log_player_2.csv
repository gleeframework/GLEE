Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your feedback, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!

While Alice is coming down in price, there's still room for negotiation before reaching our limit."

This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a price closer to Alice's value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $112. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and $112 is a reasonable deal, saving us $38 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the product."
