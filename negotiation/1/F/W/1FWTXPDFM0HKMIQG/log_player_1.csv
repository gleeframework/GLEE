"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining and can still potentially secure a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 6 rounds remaining and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 is always a safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $10,000.  While I have 4 rounds remaining, it's highly unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal with Bob.  Also, selling to John for $10,000 is still an option, but I'm not sure if I can guarantee that deal. Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice."
