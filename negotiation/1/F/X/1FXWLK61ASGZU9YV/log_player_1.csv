Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I won't sell the product for less than $100, as that's its value to me. 
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's above that to make it worth his while. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, so I want to offer Bob a price that's lower than that to increase the chances of him accepting.
* **Negotiation room:**  A price of $90 gives me some profit while still being attractive to Bob. 

This offer balances my need for profit with the need to incentivize Bob to buy the product."
