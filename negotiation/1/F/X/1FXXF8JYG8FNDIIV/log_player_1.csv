{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

By offering a lower price to Bob initially, I am incentivizing him to accept the deal, as he knows he could get the product for a higher price from John. However, if Bob rejects the offer, I can still negotiate with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
