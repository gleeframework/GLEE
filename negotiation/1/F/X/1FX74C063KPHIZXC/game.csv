"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a purchase closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
