Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, it's best to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchor Price:** Offering $120 sets an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to stay closer to $120 than if you started at a lower price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the initial offer."
