"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's a valuable asset, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
