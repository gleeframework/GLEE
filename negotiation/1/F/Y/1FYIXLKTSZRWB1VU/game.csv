"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more than $8,000, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $13,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we're getting closer.  How about $11,500?  That reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",11500.0,Alice,5,
