"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down significantly?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $650,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we try $1,200,000?  This is still a significant discount from the product's true value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate some. That said, we're still pretty far apart on price. To be frank, anything over a million dollars is going to be a non-starter for me.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a very serious offer, and reflects the maximum I'm able to spend.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your potential gains.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate your increased offer, but $900,000 is still slightly below what I need. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This price acknowledges your needs and allows me to proceed with the sale. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
