Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
