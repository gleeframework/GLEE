"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $10,250? That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,250. How about $9,875? Can you consider that?",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you. Let's close this out.",10000.0,Alice,5,
