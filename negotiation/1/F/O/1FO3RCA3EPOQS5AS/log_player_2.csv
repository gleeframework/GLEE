{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying, but also demonstrates his desire to negotiate. It's a good starting point for further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer from the previous round, but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer. This counteroffer demonstrates that he's willing to meet halfway, while still trying to get a good deal.  It's a strong move to potentially close the gap and get a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $100,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price. It's a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might only save a small amount of money. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the product and keeps the negotiation process moving forward."
