"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully curated and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics in her message, her offer of $14,000 is still $1,000 less than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you money."
