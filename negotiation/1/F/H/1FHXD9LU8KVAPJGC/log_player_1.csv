Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price you're looking for. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $800,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's close to the value he places on the product. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale than risk him walking away entirely or continuing to negotiate further, potentially leading to a lower price.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting his offer allows me to move on to other opportunities and is still a substantial profit."
