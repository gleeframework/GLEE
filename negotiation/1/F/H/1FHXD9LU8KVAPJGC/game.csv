"I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price you're looking for. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $800,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
