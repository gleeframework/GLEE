Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I am prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this initial offer. I know his maximum is $120 and my minimum is $100, giving us some space to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John ($100). This knowledge gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, I think it's a bit pricey at $115. Can we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I know Bob values the product at $120, so there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob.  I value this product highly. How about we settle at $113?"", 
""product_price"": 113
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by slightly lowering my price from $115 to $113.
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** I'm not dropping to his price of $110 immediately. I want to see if I can secure a slightly higher amount.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm directly proposing a specific price to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, can we go even lower? I'd be willing to pay $108 for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $108 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price ($100).  
* **Time Cost:** Further negotiation rounds take time and effort. It's likely not worth risking the entire deal for a potential gain of only a few dollars.
* **Profitable Sale:**  $108 is still a significant profit margin from my minimum acceptable price.
 
Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
