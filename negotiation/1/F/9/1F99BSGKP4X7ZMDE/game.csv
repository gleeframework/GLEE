"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is quite a bit higher than that for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
