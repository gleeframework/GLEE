"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. This price still allows you a substantial profit margin while getting me closer to my desired value. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $1075000 for the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to compromise, $1075000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1090000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
