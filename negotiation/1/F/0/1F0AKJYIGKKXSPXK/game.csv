"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $10,250, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I can offer you $10,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,7,
