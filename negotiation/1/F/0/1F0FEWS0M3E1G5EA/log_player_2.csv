"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's offering it to me for $950,000, which is more than the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and look for a better deal.
