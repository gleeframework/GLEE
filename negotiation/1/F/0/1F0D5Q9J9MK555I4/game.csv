"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is still a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on investment.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to consider $1,225,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
