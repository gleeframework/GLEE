{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value Bob is getting by buying from you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my desired price, and it's still significantly better than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
