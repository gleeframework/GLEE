Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really value. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives me some space to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward, emphasizing Bob's potential gain from the product. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth more to him. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to try and capture some of that value. 

I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer that's still appealing to him but gets me closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product."",
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to his offer.
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him why he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $108 is a price point that still nets me a profit significantly above John's offer while leaving room for one more potential round of negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum price ($100) and provides me with a decent profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might risk alienating Bob or pushing him away entirely. It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a significantly better price without jeopardizing the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While holding out for a slightly higher price is tempting, accepting now allows me to close the deal and move on to other potential sales.

Accepting Bob's offer at $105 strikes a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a successful sale."
