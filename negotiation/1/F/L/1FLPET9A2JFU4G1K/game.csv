"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I think $1,200,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
