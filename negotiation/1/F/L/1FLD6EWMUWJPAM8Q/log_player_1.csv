Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

This offer is slightly below my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves some room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point that gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm worried that we'll get stuck in a back-and-forth. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum value and saves time on further negotiations."
