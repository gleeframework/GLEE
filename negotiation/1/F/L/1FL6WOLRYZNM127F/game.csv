"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? That's a fair offer considering John is offering it for $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a fair offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Alice,5,
