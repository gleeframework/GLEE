"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Positive message:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open a dialogue with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $180 leaves space for counteroffers without immediately pushing Bob away. 
* **Option to switch to John:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not taking unreasonable risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $120 is my minimum, it's still too early to accept. 
* **Potential for higher price:** There are still 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can push for a better price than $120.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to negotiate. This might make him reconsider and potentially raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price of $180. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** I'm not going down to Bob's offer, but I'm also acknowledging his position by meeting him halfway. This shows flexibility and willingness to work towards a solution.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and respectful is important to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While $150 is closer to my initial offer, there's still some wiggle room in case Bob isn't willing to go that high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $130 is only $10 away from my minimum, I'm still not desperate to sell.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have 6 rounds left. There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher if I continue to push.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $120 would be a loss compared to my potential negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will try to make a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming to increase Bob's offer closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only decreasing the price by $10 from my previous offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but also firm on my value. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value can make him more inclined to meet me halfway. 
* **Fairness appeal:** Emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us can make the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will continue to negotiate but be prepared to consider selling to John in the final rounds if I can't secure a price that's closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $130. If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds left.  
* **No significant improvement:**  It's unlikely Bob will raise his offer much further. 
* **Minimizing potential loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $130 guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John for $120.

**Next Steps:** While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is the most pragmatic choice considering the limited time and the potential for a lower outcome."
