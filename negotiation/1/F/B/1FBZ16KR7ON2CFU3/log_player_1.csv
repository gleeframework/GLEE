Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob, who values it at $1,200,000. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value incentivizes him while leaving me with a substantial profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive value."
