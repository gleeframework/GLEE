This offer starts high, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  It leaves room for negotiation but also shows I'm serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll counter with a higher offer, but if he continues to lowball me, I'll sell to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?

Bob is still offering a price that's below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to counter one more time.  If he rejects that, I'll sell to John."
