Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **Opens the door for conversation:**  This offer allows for a back-and-forth exchange with Bob to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below your ideal price. You can try to push for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  You might be able to get closer to your goal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? That way we're both getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is still a bit below your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Close to your goal:** $92 is only $8 away from your initial offer of $100, which is a decent outcome.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, potentially even dipping below your minimum of $80.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation would require more back-and-forth, which could be time-consuming and lead to frustration.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that's good for both parties and allows you to move on to other opportunities."
