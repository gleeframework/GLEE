"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is under your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better deal. Alice knows the product is worth $12,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price.  You can then see if Alice comes back with a counter-offer closer to $12,000."
