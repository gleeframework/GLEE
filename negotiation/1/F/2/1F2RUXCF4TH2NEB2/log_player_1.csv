Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my minimum acceptable price is confidential, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This gives you a strong position to negotiate from.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for a price slightly above that might seem like a ""good deal"" to him, even if it's significantly lower than your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to either meet him somewhere in the middle or politely decline and move on to John. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the chosen strategy maximizes the potential profit while still offering a price Bob might find attractive."
