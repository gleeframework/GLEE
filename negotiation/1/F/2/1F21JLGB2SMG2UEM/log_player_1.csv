"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price downwards in subsequent rounds.  However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $8,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $8,000, I still believe I can potentially get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  While I could continue to counteroffer, I'm running out of rounds, and I'm concerned that I might end up getting less than John's offer.  It's time to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
