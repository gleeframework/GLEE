"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum.  Let's start the conversation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This gives you a substantial discount while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your point about budget constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below where I need to be. Let's try to find a happy medium.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. How does that sound?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. How about $975,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works.  I'm willing to come down to $985,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",985000.0,Alice,7,
