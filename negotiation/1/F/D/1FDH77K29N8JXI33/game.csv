"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a significant profit for you, and a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to lower the price to $900000, which is still a significant profit for me and a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's find a way to make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to accept your offer of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a price of $887500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
