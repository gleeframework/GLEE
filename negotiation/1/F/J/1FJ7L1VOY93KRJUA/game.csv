"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a great compromise. I think you'll really enjoy the product, and this price is a steal!",85.0,Alice,5,
