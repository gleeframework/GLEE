"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a fair value for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, let's go for $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $1,200,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
