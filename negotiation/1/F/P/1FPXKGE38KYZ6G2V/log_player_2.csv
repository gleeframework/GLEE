Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $10,250 for the product. I'm thinking we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we try $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John provides a guaranteed price point that aligns with my budget."
