"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I understand you're looking for $17,000, but I'm still only able to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's  closer to my budget and still leaves you with a decent profit.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,
