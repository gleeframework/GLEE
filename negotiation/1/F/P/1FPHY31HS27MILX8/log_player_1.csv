"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I understand you're looking for $17,000, but I'm still only able to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's  closer to my budget and still leaves you with a decent profit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $14,000. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees the best possible outcome at this stage."
