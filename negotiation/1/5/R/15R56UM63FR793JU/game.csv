,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $100.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $102? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I put into it.",102.0,Alice,5,
