Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering how much value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, which might make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially increase the price further. 
* **John as a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Accepting it would be a loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob acknowledges the product's value and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a counteroffer that could be more profitable for me.
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a fallback option, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer without losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still represents a significant discount considering the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering within a reasonable range:**  I'm counteroffering at $110, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $110 is a good deal for him.
* **Focusing on compromise:** I'm suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting my counteroffer.
* **Still leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can potentially adjust my counteroffer again. This keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
