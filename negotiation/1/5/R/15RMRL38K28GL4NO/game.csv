"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than what I could get from other buyers, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 still doesn't meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable deal.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",980000.0,Bob,6,
