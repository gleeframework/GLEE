Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  His counteroffer is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,300,000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value of the product while providing you with a substantial savings. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's the best I can get from Bob at this point.  Selling to John would be more profitable, but it carries the risk of losing a potential client.  It's better to lock in a sale now and focus on building a relationship with Bob for future opportunities."
