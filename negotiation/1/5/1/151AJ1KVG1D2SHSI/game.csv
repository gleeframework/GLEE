"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1100000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1300000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value of the product while providing you with a substantial savings. Let's try to find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
