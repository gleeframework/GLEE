"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. 
* This is a better deal than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a lower price than your alternative."
