Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $12200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, the price is still above Bob's budget. There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to try and get a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, or Bob can push for his desired $11,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort, but $12,200 is still a bit too much. I'm firm on my offer of $11,000. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $11,000. This demonstrates consistency and strengthens his position.  He's not budging further from his target price and is showing his commitment to securing the product at a price that works for him."
