{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a little above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still close. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm hoping to get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $11,200? That's still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it saves me money compared to buying from John. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to push for a higher price,  Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good deal.  It's above my minimum and secures a sale without risking further negotiation.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
