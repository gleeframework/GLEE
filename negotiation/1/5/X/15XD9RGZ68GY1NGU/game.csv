"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit short on the profit margin at $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11,000, which would be $10,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",10500.0,Alice,5,
