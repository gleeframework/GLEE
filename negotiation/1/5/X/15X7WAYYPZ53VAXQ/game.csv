"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. It's a unique item with real value, and I'm confident it's worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe $8000 would be a fair price for it. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this amount.",8000.0,Bob,4,
