"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above his maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's offering $13,000, which is still below his maximum budget of $15,000 and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This should hopefully be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a decent price than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying more or losing the deal altogether."
