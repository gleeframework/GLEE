"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While $1,250,000 is a decent offer, we have room to push for a better price. Bob clearly sees the value in the product and is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's settle this right now - $1,275,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This strategy employs a few tactics:

* **Showing Flexibility:** I've moved from my previous offer, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""settle this right now"" adds a bit of pressure and suggests this is my best offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between his last offer and my last counteroffer, which often feels like a fair compromise to both parties. 

I'm aiming to close the deal quickly with a strong offer before Bob's counteroffers potentially drop the price too low."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from that number, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,225,000 is still a significant profit margin over your minimum ($1,000,000) and John's standing offer. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob's offers have been consistently decreasing. Holding out much longer risks him offering even less or walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now puts the money in your hand sooner, which is always advantageous in business."
