"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to maneuver if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, it's a good compromise that will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better offer. I'm aware that I have John as an alternative buyer, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is a firm offer, but I'm willing to accept it.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
