{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still below my minimum price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, while also giving me a good starting point to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? I think that would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a more profitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price that leaves us both satisfied."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150, I am still hesitant to accept it. I am willing to make one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a more profitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $100 just isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let's finalize this deal at $105!"", ""product_price"": 105}
