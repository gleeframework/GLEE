"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, how about $10,000 even? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
