Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This is a high opening offer, reflecting the value I place on the product. It also allows room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for me. If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or cut my losses and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but still maintains a profitable margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. However, there's no guarantee he'll accept any higher counteroffers.  I've already spent time negotiating and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
