Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $90 is still higher than my minimum value of $80, and it seems like Bob is willing to pay close to my initial price. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
