"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price.  We have a good alternative with John, so we can be firm in our counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget. 
* **Polite and Direct:** We maintain a friendly tone while clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice met us halfway between our initial offer ($100) and her original price ($140). This suggests she's willing to negotiate.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not the $100 we hoped for, $125 is still within our $120 budget.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from Alice at $125 saves us the hassle of going to another seller. 

While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice retracting her offer."
