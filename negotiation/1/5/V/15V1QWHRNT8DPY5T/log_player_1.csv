"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I use a positive and engaging message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's potential value to Bob to pique his interest. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  By keeping my options open with John, I'm not pressured to accept any offer that's too low. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  That's my absolute max, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to maintain leverage in the negotiation. By making a counteroffer, I can try to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While $12,000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I can't go that low just yet.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels fair, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle of our previous offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for my counteroffer (""split the difference""). This helps Bob understand my logic and encourages him to see the value in the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us.  By showing a willingness to negotiate while standing firm on my value, I hope to reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm still stuck at $12000. It's my absolute limit, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price.  While John is a backup option, I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm sticking with the negotiation for now.  I'll make one more counteroffer in the next round and then reassess my options based on Bob's response. I want to exhaust all possibilities before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try one more time to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding pressure to Bob to accept.
* **Value Appeal:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why it's worth the price.
* **Compromise:** While not ideal, $13,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's desired price, but still maintains my value.

**Strategy:**

I'm using this counteroffer as a last attempt to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll likely move on to John to secure a guaranteed sale."
