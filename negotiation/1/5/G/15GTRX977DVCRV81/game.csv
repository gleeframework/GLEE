"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $975,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to look at other options.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
