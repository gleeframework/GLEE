Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob (his maximum willingness to pay).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her desired price, she should aim to get the highest price possible from Bob without losing the sale. Here's how:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I move forward with other interested parties. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $999,999. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 999999}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** The message creates a sense of scarcity and urgency. 
* **High Anchor Price:** By starting just below Bob's maximum, it makes the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Limited-Time:** This pressures Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Outcome**

* **Bob Accepts:** Alice gets the best possible price from Bob, exceeding her minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John at her desired price. 

**Important:**  This strategy ensures Alice never sells below her minimum acceptable price."
