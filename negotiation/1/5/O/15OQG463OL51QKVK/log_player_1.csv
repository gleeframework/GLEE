{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum price. This allows for room to negotiate while still being profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than his initial value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,800 is still a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $9,150? I'm confident this product will be a valuable addition to your business, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $9,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or Bob walking away completely is too high. It's better to take the guaranteed $9,000 and move on."
