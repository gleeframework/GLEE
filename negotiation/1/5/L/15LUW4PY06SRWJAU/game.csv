"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option for the same product at a similar price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have another option, but I'm not willing to go that low.  $10000 is my final offer.  It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  If this isn't acceptable, I will have to move forward with my other buyer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
