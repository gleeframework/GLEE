"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,650,000.  This is my final offer.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my financial situation and the price I am able to afford, I cannot accept $1,650,000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I hope this proposal allows us to move closer to a fair agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
