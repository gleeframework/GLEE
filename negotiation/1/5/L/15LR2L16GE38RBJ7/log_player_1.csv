Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it right away. Bob clearly wants a better deal, but I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see where we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $135. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm happy to secure a sale at that price. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiations with Bob."
