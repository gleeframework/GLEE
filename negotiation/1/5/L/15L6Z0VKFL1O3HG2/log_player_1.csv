"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I want to earn. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum threshold.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal and avoid risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or selling to John for the same amount."
