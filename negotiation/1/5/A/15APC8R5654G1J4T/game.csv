"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good margin. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I'm still not quite at that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good price.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
