"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good margin. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You have room to counteroffer before you need to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I'm still not quite at that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good price.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate and you might have to buy from John at $800,000. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
