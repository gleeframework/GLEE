"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential returns.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
