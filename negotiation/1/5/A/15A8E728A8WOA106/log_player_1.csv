"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,800,000) knowing that I can always lower it later.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to try and set a high bar in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While I'm starting high, I'm leaving room for negotiation and inviting Bob to share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, but I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line so drastically in the first round.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  My minimum is $1,500,000. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also giving him a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that's midway between my minimum and his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Keep the Pressure On:** My message reinforces that I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is closer to your minimum and a good middle ground. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Since I'm already nearing my minimum, and there's a good chance we might not be able to close a deal if I reject his offer, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale.  This ensures I get a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
