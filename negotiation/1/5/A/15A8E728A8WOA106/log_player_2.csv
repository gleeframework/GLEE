You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth exploring a counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  My minimum is $1500000. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I want to see if we can negotiate further."
