"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the special price, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your own asking price.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it as it doesn't meet my minimum requirement for this product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $9,000 for the product? I believe this strikes a balance between the value the product holds for you and my asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $8,900 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for you while allowing us to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties. I hope you find this offer reasonable.",8900.0,Alice,5,
