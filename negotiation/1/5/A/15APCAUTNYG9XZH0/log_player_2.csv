"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find this price very competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a little more.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is a good deal for Bob. He gets the product for $200 less than what he'd pay John, and it's still within his budget. There's no guarantee he'll get a better price in subsequent rounds, so accepting now is the most sensible choice."
