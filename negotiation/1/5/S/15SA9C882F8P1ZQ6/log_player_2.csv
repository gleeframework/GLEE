"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $925000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $925,000 is a reasonable price considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and accepting the offer saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John."
