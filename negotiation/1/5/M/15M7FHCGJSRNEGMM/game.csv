"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $85?  This is the highest I can go at the moment.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $100.50. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",100.5,Alice,5,
