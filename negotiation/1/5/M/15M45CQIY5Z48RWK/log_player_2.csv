"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $200.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  While $180 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'd be happy to pay $150, which is closer to what I can afford.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting closer to my target, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $170, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm determined to try and negotiate a lower price. I have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $170 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $160, which is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $170, which is $165. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $45 above my ideal price. While I could keep negotiating, I've already reached my absolute maximum offer of $160 and have only three rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase the product from John for $120. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids potentially wasting more time on a negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
