"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I should make a counteroffer below $7,500 to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims for a significant discount while still leaving room for further negotiation. It's important to be polite and express continued interest in the product."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is now willing to go down to $7,000.  There's still some room for negotiation, and I'd rather try to get a lower price than settle for $7,000 right now. I'll make another counteroffer closer to her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm still interested and willing to negotiate, but also that I'm serious about getting a lower price.  By splitting the difference between her last offer and my previous counteroffer, it suggests a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable going all the way to $6,750. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be significantly less than $7,200. Accepting this offer secures a decent discount from Alice's original price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
