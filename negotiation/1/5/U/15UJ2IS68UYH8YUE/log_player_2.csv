"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $1,000,000 to you at a discounted price. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from her true value, it's still above your maximum price point.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair given its value to me and allows for a profit for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price, but closer to my target.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000, which represents a significant discount for you and a good deal for me.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,125,000.  While this is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
