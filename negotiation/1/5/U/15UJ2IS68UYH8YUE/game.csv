"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair given its value to me and allows for a profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000, which represents a significant discount for you and a good deal for me.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you're interested in.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
