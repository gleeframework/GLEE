Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's closer to my limit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $14,000 offer.  He's consistently stayed below my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting into the later rounds. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale at my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob not increasing his offer enough in the remaining rounds."
