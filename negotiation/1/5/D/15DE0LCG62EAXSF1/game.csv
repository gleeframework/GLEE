"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $18,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a deal we're both happy with.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the lower price but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given my budget, I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. While $13,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's true worth.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my budget and offering $14,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's closer to my limit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
