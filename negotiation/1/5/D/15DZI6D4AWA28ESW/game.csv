"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm a bit of a savvy buyer, and I've done my research. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet the $8200 price point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $8100 is the right price for me. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk and make a lower offer. I'm thinking $6500 is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",6500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to walking away. I'm thinking $6000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price, but if not, I'll have to explore other options.",6000.0,Bob,8,

I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin too much.
