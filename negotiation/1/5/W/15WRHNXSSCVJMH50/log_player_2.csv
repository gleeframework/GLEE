``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good price, you can potentially get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking to stay within a $100 budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a great deal for you considering you can get it for $100 from John. It's a small compromise, but you get the product for less than your initial target."
