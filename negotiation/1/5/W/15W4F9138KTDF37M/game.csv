"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a good compromise that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This is a very fair offer, and I hope we can close the deal on this.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
