"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, well above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value of $1,500,000.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to be aggressive in my initial offer. If Bob rejects, I can always fall back to John.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  By starting high, I hope to establish a strong negotiation position and encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a more balanced exchange."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I still have 9 rounds left, and the knowledge that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. 
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it also acknowledges his perceived value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential concessions in later rounds if necessary.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By moving closer to Bob's position, I aim to encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to converge on a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean selling the product for less than its worth to me.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer has increased slightly, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** This offer is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. It demonstrates my firm stance and willingness to walk away if necessary.
* **Signal of Finality:** Presenting my minimum acceptable price in this round signals that I'm serious about securing a deal at least this high.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This offer puts the pressure on Bob to either meet my price or risk losing the deal entirely. He knows that I have a backup buyer at the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stagnation:** Bob's offer has remained stagnant at $1,200,000,  well below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and there's a significant gap between our positions.
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000. There's no need to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price. 

By selling to John, I can ensure I get my desired value for the product. The remaining rounds are unlikely to lead to a better outcome, given Bob's reluctance to budge."
