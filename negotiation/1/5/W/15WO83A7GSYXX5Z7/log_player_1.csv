Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's something you'll really find valuable.  I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, mentioning that you think Bob will find value might make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"" you invite Bob to engage in the conversation, rather than just giving a simple yes/no scenario.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
