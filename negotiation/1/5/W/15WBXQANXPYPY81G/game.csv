"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I'm confident its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  Let's find a figure that works for both of us.  What do you think about a price of $1000000? This would give you a considerable advantage while still allowing me to receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
