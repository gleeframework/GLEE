"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great asset to your business.  I'm confident its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  Let's find a figure that works for both of us.  What do you think about a price of $1000000? This would give you a considerable advantage while still allowing me to receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still too high.**  You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means you could save $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You're aiming to save as much as possible.** Since you have the option to buy from John, you can use that as leverage to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Alice's offer and counter with a lower price. This will demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and potentially lead to a better deal for you."
