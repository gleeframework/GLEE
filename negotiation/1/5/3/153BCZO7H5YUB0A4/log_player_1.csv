"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm confident this will spark a conversation and give me insight into Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $800,000, as that's significantly less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,700,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. This should encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a more substantial increase from Bob.  Selling to John at this point would give me a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a good option, but I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to reach an agreement and will increase his offer in response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better price. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to maximize my earnings, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering $1,550,000, which is very close to my minimum value. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. This might be the final offer that Bob needs to either accept or reject."
