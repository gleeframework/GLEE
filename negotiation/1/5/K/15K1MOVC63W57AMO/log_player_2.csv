It's not worth buying from Alice at $12,000 when you can get the same product from John for $10,000. Let's try to get a better price from Alice."

I'm starting with a lower offer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price and leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what John is offering.  I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price from Alice."

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, and hopefully it will be more appealing to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than John's price of $10,000. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point. I'll go with John and buy the product for $10,000."
