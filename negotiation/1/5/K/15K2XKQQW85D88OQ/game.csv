"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product offers is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
