{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still attractive to Bob, but also allows for room to negotiate higher.  It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I can afford to be a little flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed sale to John for a much better price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while also maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $12,000, and I believe I can get a better price with him.  It's important to prioritize maximizing my profit."
