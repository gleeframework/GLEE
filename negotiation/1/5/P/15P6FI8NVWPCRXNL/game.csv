"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'll try to meet you at $85. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $80, which is a very fair offer considering John is offering the same deal.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think John's offer might be a better option for me. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you at $87. That's as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for this product. What do you say?",87.0,Alice,7,
