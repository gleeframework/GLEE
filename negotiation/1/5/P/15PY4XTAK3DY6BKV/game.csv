"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's try $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value to me is still higher than $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $862,500. This would be a win-win scenario, allowing you to still make a profit while I get the product at a price that fits my budget.  What do you think?",862500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer $870,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
