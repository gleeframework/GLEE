"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and try to get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value to me is still higher than $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still $75,000 higher.  You can likely negotiate further and secure a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to try for a lower price in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer $870,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $870,000, which is only $70,000 less than her initial offer. It's clear that she's not willing to come down significantly further. You've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that you'll be able to get much lower. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $800,000. You'll save $70,000 compared to Alice's final offer, and you'll avoid further negotiation."
