"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $8,750? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm trying to make a profit on this sale, and I think this price is more in line with the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $8,800. This is a fair offer considering your initial asking price and my budget.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $8,800, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9,000, but that's the final price I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
