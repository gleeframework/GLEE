It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a good price, but there's potential to get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $400,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$450,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price point. It's also better than what John is offering.  I'll accept this offer to secure the product."
