"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I want to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,500 is a fair price.  It's above my minimum and we've reached a compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
