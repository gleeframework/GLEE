Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This should encourage Bob to negotiate but also highlight the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm offering to sell the product for $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still allows me to make a profit.  It should be more attractive to Bob than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting it.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
