I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than $100, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $110. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 107.50}

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. Can we do $103? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial desired price of $110, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a satisfactory result. With only four rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal at all is too high. Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is better than risking losing out completely."
