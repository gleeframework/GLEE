"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he has a budget that allows for a high price.  I'm hoping to secure a good price for my product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and closer to his offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than my minimum. I believe this is a fair price that still benefits me while showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round.  I want to try to get closer to the $8,000 price, even if I only get $8,500, I'm still earning more than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $8,500.  This is a compromise that is closer to my minimum price and shows I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. I believe this offer is fair and gives me a good price while still acknowledging that Bob is not willing to pay my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  The negotiations with Bob are getting too low for my liking, and I'm concerned that if I continue I may not get my minimum price of $8,000.   By selling to John, I can secure my minimum price and avoid further negotiations."
