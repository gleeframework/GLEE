"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product ($1,200,000 vs $800,000). There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer. Buying from John immediately would be a significantly worse deal than potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her perceived value.  This shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm price that is more reasonable for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her perceived value. It's worth exploring further negotiation as there is still room for a better price. Buying from John would be a worse deal, and continuing to negotiate with Alice provides the potential for a more advantageous outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is again a compromise, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still ensuring a favorable deal for Bob.  This price is closer to Alice's perceived value, making it more likely for her to accept, but still saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly better than buying from John at $1,500,000.  While there is still room for negotiation, it's likely that Alice will not go lower, and the risk of her rejecting a further counteroffer and running out of rounds increases. It's a good deal for Bob, and it's wise to accept it."
