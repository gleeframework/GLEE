"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle and offer $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
