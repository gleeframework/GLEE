{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum earnings.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the value to Bob ($8,000) shows I'm aware of his perspective, increasing the chances of a positive response.
* **Openness:**  Ending with a question and invitation to discuss encourages negotiation and avoids a rigid stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While his offer is closer, there's room for further negotiation. I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees my minimum value.  However, by continuing negotiation, I have the potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow the deal to move forward."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price"" for both sides reinforces the idea of a win-win scenario. 
* **Clarity:** Stating a specific price eliminates ambiguity and prompts a definitive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed it carefully and I believe $8,800 is the maximum I can afford for this product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, causing me to lose valuable time and potentially lowering my final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 

While I would like to earn more, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and losing the potential of earning $10,000 from John outweighs the potential gains from continued negotiation."
