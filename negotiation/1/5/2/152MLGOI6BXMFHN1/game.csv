"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8200.0,Alice,5,
