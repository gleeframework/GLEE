Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher sale price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will give me an idea of Bob's interest and potential budget for this product.

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely observe Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed. 
* I'll be prepared to make counteroffers if necessary, but I'll keep in mind the $1,000,000 offer from John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum value:** While I could accept this offer, it's not ideal as I'm not maximizing my profit. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I believe there's room to get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counter-offer and hopefully achieve a higher sale price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to carefully consider how much higher I can realistically counter with, taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* I'll keep in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's response to a more reasonable price while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:**  This counteroffer keeps me within a reasonable range, ensuring I'm not jeopardizing a sale to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but will be mindful of John's offer as a backup option."
