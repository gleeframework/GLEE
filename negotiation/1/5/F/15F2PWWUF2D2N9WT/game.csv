"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we agree on $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000 was a bit high, but I can do $10,800. This is my best offer so far, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price difference is still significant for me. To be honest, I've been considering other options. If you're able to come down to $9,800, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might have to explore those alternatives.",9800.0,Bob,6,
