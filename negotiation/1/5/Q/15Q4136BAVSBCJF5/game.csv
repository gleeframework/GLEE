"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  It's a significant amount for me and allows you to make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This offer is a fair compromise that allows me to purchase the product while also letting you make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,6,
