"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to accept $12000? This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a little more than I can spend comfortably.  How about we split the difference and go with $12750? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go up to $12750. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $13250. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
