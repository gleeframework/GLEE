"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation and is significantly better than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's also a good price point, considering Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice."
