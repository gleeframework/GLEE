"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,200 just isn't feasible for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600. This is a final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for the value this product will bring you. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8100.0,Bob,6,
