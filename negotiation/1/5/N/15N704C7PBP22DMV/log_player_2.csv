"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, as I'm actually willing to sell it to someone else for more.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal than what Alice is offering.
