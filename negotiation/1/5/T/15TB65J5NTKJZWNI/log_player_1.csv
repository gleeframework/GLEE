``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,500. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to offer $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but still a good profit for me. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. If not, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm tired of negotiating and I'm confident I can get $15,000 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John."
