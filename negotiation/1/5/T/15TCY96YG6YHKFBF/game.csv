"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $13000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
