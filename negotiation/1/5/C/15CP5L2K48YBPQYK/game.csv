"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is below my minimum. I could be persuaded to part with it for $925,000. This accounts for the true value and potential I believe it holds.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
