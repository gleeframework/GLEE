Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
