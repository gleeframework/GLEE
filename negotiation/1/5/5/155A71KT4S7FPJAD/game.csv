"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000.  It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. Let's compromise at $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $925,000? This is a good compromise that's fair for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $900,000.  That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
