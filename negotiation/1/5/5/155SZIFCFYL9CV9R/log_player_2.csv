"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more. By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have a lot of room to maneuver before reaching your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a bold move, but it establishes that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  If Alice is genuinely interested in selling, she'll likely counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $500,000 offer.  $400,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject my next counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids that risk."
