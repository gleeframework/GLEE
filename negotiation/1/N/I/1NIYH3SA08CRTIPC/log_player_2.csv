"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  As Bob, I'm looking to save as much money as possible and stay below my $800,000 budget.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm determined to stay below $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a price much closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a move on this â€“  how about $1,100,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is applying pressure by mentioning another buyer and using the ""last chance"" tactic.  However,  $1,100,000 is still above my budget. It's better to keep negotiating for a better price and risk losing the deal than to accept an offer outside my financial limit.  There's still room for a counteroffer, and I'm not yet ready to give up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. To demonstrate my good faith, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and our budget constraints. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving from your original offer.  It seems we both recognize the value here.  To be fair to us both, I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one buyer or the other soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, we're nearing the end of our rounds. It's time to be realistic and acknowledge that there's a significant gap in our valuations.  Since my goal is to stay within my budget, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product at a price I can afford, even if it means losing the chance for a potentially lower price with Alice."
