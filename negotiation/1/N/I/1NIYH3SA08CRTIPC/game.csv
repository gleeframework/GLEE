"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a price much closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a move on this â€“  how about $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. To demonstrate my good faith, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and our budget constraints. Let's work together to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving from your original offer.  It seems we both recognize the value here.  To be fair to us both, I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one buyer or the other soon.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
