The product is worth more than $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before buying from John."

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

While $105 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll counter with a lower price to see if we can find common ground."

Alice has come down to $100, which is still more than my budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  Although I would have preferred a lower price, I'm still getting the product at a price that's within my range."
