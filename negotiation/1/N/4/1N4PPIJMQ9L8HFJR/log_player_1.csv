Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal and I know you'll benefit from it. I'm proposing a price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  A starting offer of $20,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significantly higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the high starting point leaves room for negotiation. You can always lower the price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
