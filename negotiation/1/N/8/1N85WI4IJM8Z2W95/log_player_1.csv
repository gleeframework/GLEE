Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How does $130 sound?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $130, you leave room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $80 gives you a strong bargaining position. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
