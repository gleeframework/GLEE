"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1400000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll compromise at $1350000. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to push the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll make one more compromise at $1300000. I think it's the lowest I can go while still making a profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product at a fair price. I'm going to make one final offer at $1300000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
