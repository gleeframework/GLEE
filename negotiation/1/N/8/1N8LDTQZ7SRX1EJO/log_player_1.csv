Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating why it's worth more than Bob's perceived value. This opens the door for Bob to potentially justify a higher price himself.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This gives you some leverage.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. You can gradually lower the price, but aim to stay above your $1,200,000 minimum."
