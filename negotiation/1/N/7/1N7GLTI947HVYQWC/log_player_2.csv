# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
