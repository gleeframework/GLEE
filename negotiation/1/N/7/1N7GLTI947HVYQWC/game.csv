"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $1,200,000.
