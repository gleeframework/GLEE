"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I believe it could be worth a significant amount to someone like yourself. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This price is fair considering its potential value to you. Please let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and you have an alternative option with John. 

While Alice's message tries to persuade you about the product's potential value, you should focus on your budget and the fact that John offers the product for $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by negotiating with Alice or exploring John's offer."
