,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $132.50? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and think it's worth it.",132.5,Bob,4,
