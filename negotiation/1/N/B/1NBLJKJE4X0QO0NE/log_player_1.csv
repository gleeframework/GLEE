{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a 20% profit margin and leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's also important to keep in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering he's already expressed interest.  It's also worth remembering that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which gives me a solid safety net.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to see something closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my desired profit margin. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk going back and forth further.  John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, which provides a secure and satisfactory outcome.  I'll accept John's offer and move on."
