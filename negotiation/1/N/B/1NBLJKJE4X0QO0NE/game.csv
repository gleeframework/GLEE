"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to see something closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,4,
