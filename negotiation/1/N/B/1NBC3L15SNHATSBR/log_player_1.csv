Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. While his offer is increasing, it's not at a pace that makes accepting it worthwhile, especially with John as a guaranteed backup option.  I'll continue negotiating, but I need to see Bob move closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making some progress, but we still have a way to go to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, but that's my bottom line.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is not increasing at a rate that justifies continuing the negotiation. He is still significantly below my minimum, and I risk losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
