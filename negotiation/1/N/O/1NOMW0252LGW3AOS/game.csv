"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $80. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
