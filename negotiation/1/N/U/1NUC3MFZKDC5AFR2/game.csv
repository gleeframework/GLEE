"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $13500 for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice, but $13500 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $12000.  Would you be willing to go to $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I can do $14000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to close this deal at $12500.  It's the best I can do at this time.  Is there any room to move on your end?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $13500 again, but I'm not budging below that. It's my final offer, I'm afraid.",13500.0,Alice,7,
