"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While $1200000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you. $1250000 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference at $1300000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, I'm not comfortable going lower than $1250000. This is a fair price for this valuable product, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  ",1250000.0,Alice,7,
