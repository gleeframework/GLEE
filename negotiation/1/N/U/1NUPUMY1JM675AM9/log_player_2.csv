"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try and secure a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $12,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm aiming to split the difference between my maximum budget and Alice's initial price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a slight improvement from her initial offer, but it's still lower than my desired price.  I believe I can negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a better deal within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $11,500 as a counteroffer. This is a slight increase from Alice's latest offer, but it's still below my maximum budget. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Alice's latest offer. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while still leaving room for potential adjustments in the future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 I would pay John.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal to avoid the risk of losing the product and having to pay John a higher price."
