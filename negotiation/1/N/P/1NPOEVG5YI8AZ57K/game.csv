"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I make a decent profit. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make a reasonable profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
