"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $10,000 to make it worth my while.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  That's a fair price that would allow me to buy the product and you to still make a decent profit.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that John might be a better option...",9500.0,Alice,7,
