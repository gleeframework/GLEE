# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000  to begin our conversation.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond $800,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a price closer to your desired $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,500,000 is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, you've already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected both.  It's likely that further negotiation won't bring the price down to your desired level. It's in your best interest to purchase the product from John for $800,000 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
