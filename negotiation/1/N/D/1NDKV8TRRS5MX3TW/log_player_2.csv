"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, reducing the price by $100,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  However, it's still within a reasonable range where Alice might consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, and  $850,000 is a reasonable price. It's a good deal considering John is selling for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a decent discount."
