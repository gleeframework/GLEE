"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,050,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'd like to make this work, so my best and final offer is $980,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. Let's try $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,7,
