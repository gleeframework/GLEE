Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving a chance for Bob to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **High Starting Point:** Starting with $9,500 anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential Profit:** This price point allows Alice to potentially earn a $1,500 profit, significantly more than selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price above $8,000.

By setting a high but not unreasonable price, Alice increases her chances of a more substantial profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
