"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from what I'd normally charge, and it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a product worth $10,000 to you for even less. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than the $10,000 John is willing to sell it for. You can save $2,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
