Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and might even surprise Bob into accepting a higher price than he anticipated.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand (""interest I've had"") and value to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer and start a dialogue.

While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright, it's a calculated risk. We have a safety net in John, so it's worth aiming high with Bob first."
