Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth.

Bob's offer:

While $975,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. We're getting closer, and I'm willing to counter-offer again in hopes of securing a higher amount."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $990,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Explanation: While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $990,000 is a strategic move at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This offer secures a profit of $190,000 over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Both sides have been negotiating for several rounds. Dragging it out further risks Bob losing interest or lowering his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob means potentially missing out on other buyers who might offer a similar amount.

Accepting this offer balances the potential for a higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
