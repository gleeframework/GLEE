{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. $500,000 is a great price, but there's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and I have plenty of rounds to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest. I'm hoping this will make her realize I'm serious about getting a good deal and start the negotiation process."

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $400,000 is still a decent price, but I'm going to keep trying to get lower.  There's still room for a better deal."

I'm raising my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious, but still trying to stay under $400,000. Hopefully this will get us closer to a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}

I'm meeting Alice halfway with this counteroffer, showing I'm serious about buying but not willing to go much higher. This should be a reasonable compromise."

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice is clearly not going to go much lower. $475,000 is a good price, especially compared to John's offer. I'm accepting this offer to avoid risking a complete deal breakdown."
