"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive to him, but closer to my desired value.
* **Room for Compromise:** A high initial offer allows for more negotiation rounds and potential for Bob to counteroffer, creating a path to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  The presence of John's offer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target value.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a compromise within the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:** My counteroffer is a compromise from my initial $1,200,000 offer, showing flexibility. However, it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
