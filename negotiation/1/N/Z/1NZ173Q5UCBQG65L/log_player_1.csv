Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $16,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give Alice valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This knowledge allows her to be more confident in her negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice is prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response."
