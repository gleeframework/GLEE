Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($150) than your minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100) allows room for negotiation. It tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium and gives you the flexibility to decrease the price strategically in subsequent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value ($100). Rejecting this offer signals that you're not desperate and are willing to negotiate further for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. I can do $120.  This product is truly worth it."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer significantly reduces the price from your initial offer ($150) and moves closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The $120 price keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price ($100) and provides room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value aims to nudge Bob closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $100 matches both your minimum acceptable price and his perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer ensures you make a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by further negotiation or choosing John."
