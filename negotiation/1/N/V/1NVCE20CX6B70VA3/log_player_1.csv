Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12000 as a fair price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would give us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12000 given my budget constraints. Could we possibly agree on $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to cover my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I still have some rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,500?  This is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth this amount.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we agree on $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm still more than halfway through the negotiations, and I'm in a good position to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. How about $13,750?  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to explore other options, including selling to John.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offers, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12000. Could we agree on $13250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. We're down to the final two rounds, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to close the deal quickly."
