"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to buy the product and save as much money as possible, and both Alice and John are selling it for the same price ($150), you should accept Alice's offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John."
