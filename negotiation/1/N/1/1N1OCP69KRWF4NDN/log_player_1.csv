{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** You still have room to move if needed. 
* **A reasonable amount:** It's a significant discount but not overly aggressive.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's compromise. How about $1,075,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This offer:

* **Maintains some distance from your minimum:**  You're still above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Frames it as a win-win:**  You're highlighting the benefits of reaching a deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to suggest a price of $1,062,500 for your product. This price aims to find a balance between the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,062,500 is very close to where I need to be. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be at $1,070,000.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away happy.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1070000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small step up from Bob's last offer:**  Shows you are willing to be flexible.
* **Is still above your minimum:** Leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Emphasizes a finality:**  The message suggests a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer carefully. While I understand your position, I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial solution. I propose a final price of $1,065,000 for your product. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, the risk of going back and forth is that I might not reach an agreement with him at all, and I'd lose out on a guaranteed sale to John.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
