"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'm aware of John's offer of $150, so I'm not willing to go below that.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my minimum, I can likely get more. I'm going to try to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a profit. $160 is a fair compromise, given Bob's counter-offer and my minimum. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want.  While it's still a little lower than my ideal, it's a good profit and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
