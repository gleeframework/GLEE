Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is still higher than that.

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing to a price above your ideal range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. I'm eager to finalize the sale, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Alice is difficult.  It's best to avoid further negotiation and purchase the product from John for $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
