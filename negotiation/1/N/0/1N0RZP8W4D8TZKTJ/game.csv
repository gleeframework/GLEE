"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000? It's a fair offer, and ensures you still make a significant profit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle on $1,150,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're definitely getting close. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
