"Alice,  while I appreciate the offer,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
