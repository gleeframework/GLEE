"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $15,000 to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its quality and your appreciation for it. Considering my goal is to maximize the return on this investment, I suggest we aim for a price slightly above the minimum but not too far beyond what you're willing to pay. Would you be open to discussing a price range of $14,000 to $15,000? I'm looking forward to your response and the opportunity to work together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
