"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, it's still not the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his desired price and Alice's offer.  $13,000 represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $13,500 is a better price than John's, it's still more than what Bob wants to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too.  I'm happy to meet in the middle, but I can't go any higher than $13,250. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible deal while remaining within his budget. This counteroffer is another compromise, meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying firm on his price point."
