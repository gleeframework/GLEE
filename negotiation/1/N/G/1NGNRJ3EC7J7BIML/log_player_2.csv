"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is offering the product at $8,000.  This means there is no room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John at $8,000 achieves the same outcome for you, but it's a safer bet."
