"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I believe the product is truly worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
