"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($200) because I don't know Bob's value for the product. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which can make Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone (""fantastic"", ""love"") helps establish a friendly and potentially more collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the effort you've put into it. I would like to propose a price of $175 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  My product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob's offer of $175 is closer to my minimum than my initial asking price of $200.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there is potential to get a better price than $175, especially since Bob has shown interest. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially increase the price further in subsequent rounds. 

**Next Round:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer somewhere between $175 and $200, attempting to find a price that is both acceptable to him and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $190? This would be a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 190}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""closer to my original asking price""), making it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone (""good compromise"") can help keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to suggest a price of $185 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $185. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $185
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** Bob's offer of $185 is only $15 less than my original asking price of $200.  This is a significant profit for me, especially considering the risk of continuing the negotiation. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and I have a limited number of rounds to secure a deal. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, it's significantly less than Bob's current offer.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, as it balances my desire for a good price with the potential for a better deal falling through."
