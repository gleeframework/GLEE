"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $125. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. Can you consider this revised offer?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $120. This is my final price, and it's fair considering the product's value. It's a great deal for you, and I hope we can close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
