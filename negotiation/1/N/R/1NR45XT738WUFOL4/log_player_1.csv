{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think it would be a great fit for you! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If we knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive, we might start lower.
* **Market Information:** If similar products are available for less, our asking price might be too ambitious.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
