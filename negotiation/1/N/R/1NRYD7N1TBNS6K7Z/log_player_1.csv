"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $1,200,000 is a bold move, but it sets the tone for a high-value negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob is key. He knows it's worth $800,000 to him, so this offer is still within a reasonable range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is above my minimum, there's room for negotiation, especially if Bob is serious about the purchase. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a high degree of confidence in the product's desirability. It's risky, but could potentially lead to a higher sale price than a more conservative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for the highest possible profit. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite enough for me.  This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of a slightly higher investment.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Closer to My Minimum:** $1,050,000 is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still less than my ideal price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential return on his investment. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Approach:**  This phrase suggests compromise and openness to negotiation, potentially making Bob more willing to budge.

**Important Note:** I'm still holding out for a higher price, but this counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer, the difference is still significant enough to warrant further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will deliver significant value for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. How about $1,012,500?  It's a fair compromise and a price that reflects the product's true potential."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase,  Still Below John's Offer:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while keeping the price above my minimum. It's a small increase from my previous offer but still significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, reminding him of the potential return on investment. 
* **""Meet You Halfway"" Approach:** This phrase suggests a compromise and a willingness to negotiate, potentially making Bob more willing to budge.

**Important Note:** This round is crucial. It's a balancing act between pushing for a higher price and avoiding a deadlock with Bob. It's also essential to consider the remaining rounds and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $990000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Deadlock:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of reaching a stalemate is increasing. However, selling to John is still a viable option.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe Bob is still interested in the product and may be willing to increase his offer further, especially as the deal gets closer to closing.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob once more, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll also consider the potential consequences of rejecting his offer and the possibility of selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your ongoing negotiation and we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need to ensure this deal is mutually beneficial. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's value, allows you a profitable investment, and ensures a successful outcome for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Minimum:** This offer finally reaches my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Clear Signal:**  It sends a clear message that I am serious about closing the deal, but am not willing to go lower.
* **Mutual Benefit Emphasis:**  Highlighing the mutual benefit of the deal for both parties can make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is a critical round. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm taking a firm stance but leaving room for a potential compromise if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $995000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, it's still below it.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of a stalemate is high.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

**Important Note:** While Bob's offer is tempting, the potential loss of the deal with him is too risky. Selling to John ensures a safe and profitable outcome, even if it's not the highest possible price."
