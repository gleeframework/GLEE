"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough offer for me. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get Bob to increase his offer a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $1200000, I'm willing to offer you $1300000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's more than Bob's offer and meets my minimum requirement."
