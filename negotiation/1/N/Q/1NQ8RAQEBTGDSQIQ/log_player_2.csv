"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $10,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price from Alice or opt for John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move.  It's a fair starting point, considering Alice's price of $14,000 and your maximum of $10,000. It allows for potential compromise and leaves room for Alice to counter if needed, while still keeping you within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to your target, it's still not ideal. You can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and drive the price down further. You also have the option to buy from John as a fallback if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price below Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product while still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to your limit, but it's still above your target. Continuing to negotiate might get you a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away. You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower than $13,000.

In this situation, it's safer and more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees you the product at your desired price, and you avoid further negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or a worse price."
