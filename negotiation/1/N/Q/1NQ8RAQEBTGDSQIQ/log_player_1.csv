Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I am offering a price lower than my minimum value, but still above what the product is worth to him. This gives him a potential benefit and incentivizes him to negotiate. 

If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. However, if he continues to offer a price that is below my minimum value, I will accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I am rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to get a quick sale,  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I am counter-offering Bob at $12,500. This is a compromise, as it's a bit lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than his previous offer.  I am aiming to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us."

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John."

I'm counter-offering Bob at $13,000. This is a further compromise, but I still believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. If he rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer and move on."
