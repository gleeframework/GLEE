"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $135.
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice:** This means you're getting a better deal than Alice would be getting if she sold it to John."
