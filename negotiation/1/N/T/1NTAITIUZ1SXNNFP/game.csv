"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,400,000 significantly undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,550,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us to finalize this transaction.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
