Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000,  getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal compared to the potential public listing price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, potentially allowing you to sell the product for even more than $11,500.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while considering Bob's valuation and the guaranteed sale to John."
