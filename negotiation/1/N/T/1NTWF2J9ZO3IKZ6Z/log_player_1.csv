"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise given Bob's initial low offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still offering below my minimum. I'm not yet ready to accept a price below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm lowering my offer to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and I believe it's a fair price given the current negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."

Bob has finally reached my minimum price. While I would have liked to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit."
