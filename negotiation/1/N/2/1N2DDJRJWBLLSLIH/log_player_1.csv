"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd find it very useful. My initial price is $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly higher than what I'd ideally like to get, knowing I have room to negotiate.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm not setting a hard price, but rather opening the conversation for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I briefly mention the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** The price is well above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's initial offer is a non-starter.
* **John is a backup option:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, which makes me more comfortable pushing for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $145? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm starting the counteroffer closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 
* **Negotiating with an Edge:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not rushing to accept a low price.  Having John as a backup gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a safer bet:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but John's offer is still a guaranteed $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob seems firm, I can try one more counteroffer to see if I can push him a little higher. I'll keep John as my fallback option if it doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm willing to go down to $135.  This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is very close to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good compromise, and I'm ready to accept it.

If Bob still rejects, I will sell to John for $150. This way I can maximize my profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. How about $125? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No more room for negotiation:** I've already compromised significantly, and I don't see Bob budging any further.
* **John is the best option:**  At this point, John's guaranteed $150 offer is the most profitable option.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck with a lower price and wasting precious rounds."
