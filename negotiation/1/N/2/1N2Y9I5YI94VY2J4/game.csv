"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
