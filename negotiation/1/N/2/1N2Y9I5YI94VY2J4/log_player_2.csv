"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get it to the right owner. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000.  He should reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's still possible to get a better price from Alice, and if not, he can always buy from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  He's already saved $50,000 from her initial offer and is only $50,000 away from his ideal price.  It's likely Alice is firm on this offer, and trying to push further could lead to her rejecting his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John for a higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal without the risk of a higher price."
