{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get as much as possible. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed Bob isn't willing to go higher, selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's not ideal, but it's the safest choice."
