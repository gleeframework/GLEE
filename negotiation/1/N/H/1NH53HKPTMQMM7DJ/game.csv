"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you're placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950000. This still allows you to make a profit, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our current positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
