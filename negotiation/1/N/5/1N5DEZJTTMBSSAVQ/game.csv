"Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I understand its true worth to be $1,200,000. However, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a price that reflects my confidence in its value to you, yet also allows me to ensure a fair profit. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This offer is valid for a limited time, and I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, or if you require further information to make a decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
