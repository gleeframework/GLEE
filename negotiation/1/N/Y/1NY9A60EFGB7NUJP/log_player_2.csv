You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've expressed for the product.

Alice has come down from her initial $12,000 offer, but $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've expressed for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is unwilling to go below $11,500, which is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I've tried to negotiate, but we're at an impasse.  It's time to move on and buy from John, who's offering the product for my maximum price."
