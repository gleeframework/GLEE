I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm willing to make a deal right now.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've expressed for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $10500? I'm confident we can make this deal work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've expressed for the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
