"I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and $12,000 wouldn't be fair to me. Could you consider $17,000? That's a substantial reduction from my initial offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
