"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still a price that's beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have limited rounds and John is offering $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the sale."
