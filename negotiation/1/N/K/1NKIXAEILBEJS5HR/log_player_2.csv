"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to bluff you. She claims she'll sell it to another buyer for $8,000, which is less than it's worth to her. This is unlikely. By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and open the door for a counter-offer closer to her actual value. You have John as a backup option, ensuring you won't be left without the product."
