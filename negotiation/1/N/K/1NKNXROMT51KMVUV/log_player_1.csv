{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice. 
* **Consider the Alternative:**  While Alice has a guaranteed $800,000 from John, it's significantly less than what Bob is potentially willing to pay.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice leaves a potential $100,000 on the table for Bob, making the deal more appealing to him than a very aggressive offer."
