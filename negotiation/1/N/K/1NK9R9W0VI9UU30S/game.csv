"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works well for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget limitations, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  I'm really trying to stick to a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
