"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works well for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's wise to reject the offer and start negotiating.  Bob has a strong bargaining position knowing he can walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:**  Bob starts with a counteroffer that's still higher than his ideal price but well within his budget. 
* **Appeal to value:** Bob emphasizes the value of the product to him, making it clear he's willing to pay a good price, but not an unreasonable one.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential meeting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget limitations, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point. While it's a reduction from her initial offer,  it's still not a good deal for Bob.  He should continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. He has a strong bargaining position knowing he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  I'm really trying to stick to a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on budget:** Bob reiterates his budget constraints while acknowledging Alice's previous concessions.
* **Splitting the difference:**  This shows a willingness to compromise, creating a more collaborative tone.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  Bob highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Alice's sense of reason."
