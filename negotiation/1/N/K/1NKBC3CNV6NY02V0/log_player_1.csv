"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($15,000) to see if I can leverage a larger profit. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in potentially owning it. This initial offer provides a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I could sell to John for $15,000 right now, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my price from the initial $18,000 to $16,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant compromise showing my willingness to negotiate.  I hope this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob, while still securing me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I have several rounds left, so I'm not in a hurry to accept a low offer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer and still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also trying to stay above the $13,000 mark, which is the halfway point between my minimum value and Bob's last offer. I'm also considering that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I have several rounds left, so I'm not in a hurry to accept a low offer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000 at any time.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will realize I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $13,000.  This is a compromise to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal but also a significant improvement over his last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it's only $2,000 away from his last offer.  However, I'm still keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this doesn't work out.  With only 3 rounds left, I want to be sure to reach a deal if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. With only two rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 at any time. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will realize I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price range and offer something closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a further compromise to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but it's also a significant improvement over his last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it's only $1,000 away from his last offer. With only one round left, I want to be sure to reach a deal if possible.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $15,000."
