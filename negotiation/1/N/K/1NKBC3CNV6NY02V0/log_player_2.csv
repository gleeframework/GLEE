{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Reason: I'm still not comfortable with $13,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's worth pushing to see if I can get Alice closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

Reason:  I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but keeping it just below the $12,000 mark. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to stay close to my target price. With only two rounds left, it's time to make a bold move."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to my target price of $10,000.  I've negotiated as much as I can, and rather than risk the final round and potentially lose out on the product, I'm going to go with the guaranteed price from John."
