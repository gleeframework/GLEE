"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the initial offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense. There's still a chance to get the product for less than $9,000, and if not, the option to buy from John for $10,000 remains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $8,000 shows a strong desire to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. This leaves room for potential back and forth, and potentially a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price than $10,000, I still have several rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal.  If I fail, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still keeps the price lower than Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my ideal price, I still have a few rounds to go.  I'm going to reject and counter again in hopes of getting a better deal, but with the knowledge that I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,800. This is another compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while keeping the price below Alice's last offer. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping it will be accepted.  If not, I'm getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,150 is the closest she has come to my ideal price, and we only have a few rounds left.  While I would prefer to get it even lower, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice may become less willing to compromise, and I could end up paying more or having to buy from John at $10,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a good price and avoid potential risks."
