"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, which would be a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, so I'll offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
