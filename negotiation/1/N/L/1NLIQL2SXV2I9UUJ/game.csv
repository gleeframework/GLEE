"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I believe we can find a price closer to the value I place on the product. How about offering it to me for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $9500. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from owning this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
