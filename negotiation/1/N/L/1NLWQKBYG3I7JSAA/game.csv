"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to the price you want, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
