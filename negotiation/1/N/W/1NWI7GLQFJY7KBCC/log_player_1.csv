I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting very close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can squeeze out a bit more.  I've got a few rounds left and don't want to settle for a price that's only slightly above John's offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum, and I've got a few rounds left. However, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and time is running out. To avoid the risk of losing a sale altogether, I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
