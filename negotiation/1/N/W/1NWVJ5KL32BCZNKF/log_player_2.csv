You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

This is a great deal for Bob! Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While buying from John would be an option, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob money."
