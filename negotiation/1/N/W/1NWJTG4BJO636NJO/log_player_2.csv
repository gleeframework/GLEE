"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, so there's room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer. You have a few more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.  It's still risky to buy from John at $1,500,000 when you might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,400,000 is still a bit more than my budget allows.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I can do $1350000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer. You have a few more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer.  It's still risky to buy from John at $1,500,000 when you might be able to get a better deal with Alice. You're still within your budget, so keep trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I need to make a small adjustment to make it work. I can do $1320000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget and is very close to your last counteroffer. It's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price in the remaining rounds. It's a good deal to secure the product at $1,320,000, especially since buying from John would cost you more. You have saved $180,000 compared to John's offer."
