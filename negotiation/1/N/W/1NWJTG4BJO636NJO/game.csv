"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be happy to pay $1000000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is still a bit more than my budget allows.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1300000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1300000. I can do $1350000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1350000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1325000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I need to make a small adjustment to make it work. I can do $1320000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
