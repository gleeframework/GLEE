"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
