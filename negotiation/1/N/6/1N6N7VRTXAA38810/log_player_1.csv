Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I need to get at least $800,000 to make this worthwhile, so I'm starting above that. 
* **Potential for More:** I don't know Bob's value for the product. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, so I'm pricing it higher to see if he'll bite.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not taking a huge risk with this offer.

This strategy allows me to try and maximize my profit, while also ensuring I get at least my minimum value for the product."
