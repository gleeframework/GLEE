Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this offer will give you insight into how badly he wants the product. If he accepts, you've made a great sale. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move on to John.
* **Backup Plan:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 ensures you won't be left with the product if Bob isn't interested."
