"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This represents a substantial investment for me and is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can close this deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
