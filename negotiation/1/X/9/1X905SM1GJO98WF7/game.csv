"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original ask reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
