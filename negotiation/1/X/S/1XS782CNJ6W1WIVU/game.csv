,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,280,000?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,280,000 is still too far below what I need to sell this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,315,000? This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",1315000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,315,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,290,000, but no higher. That's the best I can do.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
