"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation open and can potentially get her to lower the price further."
