Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell to John for $8,000, I believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I'm still hoping for a better price, I don't want to risk going back and forth further and ending up with a price I'm not happy with. Selling to John for $8,000 is the safest and most reliable option at this point."
