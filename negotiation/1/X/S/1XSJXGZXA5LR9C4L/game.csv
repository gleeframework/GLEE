"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget, $950,000 is still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but no more. Can we meet at this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but $990,000 just isn't enough. How about we settle on $1,020,000? This is a good compromise that recognizes your budget and the product's true value. Let's make this happen.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,020,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $995,000. Can we meet at this price?",995000.0,Bob,8,
