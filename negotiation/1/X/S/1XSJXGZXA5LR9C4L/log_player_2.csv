Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
