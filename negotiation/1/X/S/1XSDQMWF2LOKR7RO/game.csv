"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll take it for $9,250?  Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high at $9,250. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take $9,400.  That's a fair price for both of us. ",9400.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're still holding firm, but $9,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,300.  This would be a good deal for both of us and avoid a long back-and-forth. What do you say?",9300.0,Bob,4,
