"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1150000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1250000? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1250000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can strike a deal if I pay $1200000.  This would allow us both to finalize this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
