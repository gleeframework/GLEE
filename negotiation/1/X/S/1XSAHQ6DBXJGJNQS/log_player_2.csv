"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life and business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. It's better to see if Alice is willing to come down further before considering the alternative of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to spend a maximum of $10,000 on this product. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value the product will bring to you, while also being more affordable for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,800 is closer to his goal, it's still more expensive than buying from John. Bob should see if he can get Alice to lower her price even further before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit over budget.  Could we meet at $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I can offer and still ensure I make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go lower than $10,700.  While this is closer to Bob's goal, it's still more than he wants to spend. Since Bob is limited to a maximum of $10,000, it's now in his best interest to buy the product from John. This ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget."
