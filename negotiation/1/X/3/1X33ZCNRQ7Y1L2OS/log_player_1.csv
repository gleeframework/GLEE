"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product Alice, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we agree on $960,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still too far away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see more significant movement from him in the next round."
