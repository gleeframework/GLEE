"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a price point you're comfortable with, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's worth considering.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
