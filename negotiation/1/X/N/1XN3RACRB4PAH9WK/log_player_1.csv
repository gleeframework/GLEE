Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer that's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving me leverage.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""fairness"" and ""value,"" I'm framing the offer positively and appealing to Bob's rational side. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Acceptance:** Ideal scenario, I maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, and we can negotiate toward a mutually agreeable price, still likely above my minimum.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation and ensuring a safety net with John's offer."
