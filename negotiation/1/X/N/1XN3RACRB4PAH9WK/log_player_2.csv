# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You'd save $250,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **It's within your budget.** The price of $1,250,000 is well below your maximum of $1,500,000. 
* **You still get a good deal.** Even though Alice is making a profit, the price is still lower than what you'd pay John."
