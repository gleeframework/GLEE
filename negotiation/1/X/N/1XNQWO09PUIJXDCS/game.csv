Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?,8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $7250?",7250.0,Alice,3,
