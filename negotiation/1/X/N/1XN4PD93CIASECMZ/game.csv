"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your original price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is still a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be willing to go any lower than this.",9200.0,Alice,5,
