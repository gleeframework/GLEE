"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. My starting price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than my minimum ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** A friendly message can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm asking for his thoughts, leaving the door open for counteroffers and further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not even close to what the product is worth to me.  While I could accept and make a quick sale, it would be a huge loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, but still higher than his offer. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention that $125 is a ""fair price for both of us,""  emphasizing that it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Emphasizing need:**  ""I need to get for it"" subtly suggests that I have a minimum price and can't go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $100, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($100).  
* **Highlighting compromise:**  I'm framing it as a ""good compromise"" to make it sound appealing.
* **Positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly and encouraging tone."
