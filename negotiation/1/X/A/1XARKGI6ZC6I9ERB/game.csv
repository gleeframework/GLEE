"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $100, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",112.5,Alice,5,
