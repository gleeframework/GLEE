{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I think it's worth $150, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Above Minimum:**  $135 is significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($120), ensuring a good profit. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still making the deal attractive enough for him to accept."
