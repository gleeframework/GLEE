Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

How about we set the product price at $1,250,000? This offers a slight increase from my initial offer while still providing a significant discount from the product's value to you. I believe this could be a fair solution for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.
