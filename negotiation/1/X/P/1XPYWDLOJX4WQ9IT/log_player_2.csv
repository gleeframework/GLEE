"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1,300,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that's valued at $1,500,000 by you, at a competitive price. We believe this offer presents a great value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $1,250,000? This offers a slight increase from my initial offer while still providing a significant discount from the product's value to you. I believe this could be a fair solution for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point. While it's a compromise, there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob can potentially secure a lower price by continuing the negotiation process.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to explore alternative prices and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
