"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $700,000. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $837,500?",837500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to make a further concession, but $837,500 is cutting it too close.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch above my budget. I could do $850,000.  That's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,
