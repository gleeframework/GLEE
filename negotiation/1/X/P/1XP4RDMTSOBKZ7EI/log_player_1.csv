Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and still being appealing to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $8,000 from John, so I need to set a price higher than that. 
* **Bob's value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so he would still save $2,000 if he accepts my offer. This makes it a good deal for him as well.
* **Negotiation room:**  Offering $10,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.

Let's see what Bob decides!"
