"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. How about $1,150,000? That's my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This is my final offer.  I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $1,250,000, and I don't think we're going to meet in the middle at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to sell at that price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
