Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high to me. How about we meet in the middle at $122?"", 
""product_price"": 122
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $122 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I could push for a bit more, accepting $118 is a solid deal. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a profit above my minimum."
