"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000. To make this easy, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within Bob's budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it gives Bob room to potentially increase his offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to try and secure a better deal.  He can use the fact that John is willing to sell for $12,000 as leverage in his negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for his maximum budget. He's using John's offer as a baseline, demonstrating that he's not desperate and has other options. This counteroffer is a clear signal that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
