"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000. To make this easy, I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,
