"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer, as I have other buyers interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  This is my final offer.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you.",105.0,Bob,6,
