Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and your specific needs, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product, it emphasizes its unique value and Bob's potential gain, aiming to justify the high price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there would be room for counter-offers and a more nuanced negotiation strategy."
