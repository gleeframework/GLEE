Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your deal with John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA is key. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value while still leaving Bob with a substantial profit potential ($50,000).
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" enhance the perceived value.
* **Focus on Bob's ROI:** Highlighting his potential return emphasizes the benefit to him.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then adjust your price within the ZOPA to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
