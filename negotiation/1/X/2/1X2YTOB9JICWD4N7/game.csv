"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me at $9,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,5,
