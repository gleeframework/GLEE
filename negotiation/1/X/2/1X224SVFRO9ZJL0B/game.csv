"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is a bit lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to acknowledge your budget constraints. This offer still reflects the significant value the product brings, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's aim to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
