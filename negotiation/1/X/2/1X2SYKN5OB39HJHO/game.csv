,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds.  Could you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I can get out of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
