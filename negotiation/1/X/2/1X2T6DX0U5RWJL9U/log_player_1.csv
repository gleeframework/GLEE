Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're still well above John's offer, so the risk is acceptable at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one?  $1,250,000, and we have a deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a strong outcome.  It provides a $200,000 profit over my guaranteed offer from John and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
