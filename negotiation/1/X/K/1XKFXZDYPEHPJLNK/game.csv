"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This price is fair considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
