"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a great value for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This sets a high bar and allows room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message highlights the value proposition for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for negotiation by asking for his thoughts, inviting a potential counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit within the 10 rounds. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary. The threat of selling to John for $800,000 gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** While I'm not happy with Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm not ready to give up just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Leveraging the Threat:**  The option to sell to John at $800,000 gives me leverage to counter Bob's offer and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, attempting to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll aim to stay above $800,000, but be prepared to compromise if necessary to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $825,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that $825,000 is still a good deal considering the product's worth to him.
* **Focus on Agreement:** My message focuses on reaching a mutually agreeable price, making it clear I'm open to finding a solution.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to remain firm while being flexible enough to close the deal. By offering $825,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price just yet. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an increase from his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not ready to give up just yet. There's still some room for negotiation, and I believe I can secure a better price.
* **Leverage of John:** The option to sell to John for $800,000 gives me leverage to keep pressing for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll try to meet him halfway, but I'll aim for a price closer to $800,000. I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This price is fair considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm ready to close this deal if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($825,000) and Bob's current offer ($775,000).
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as a final offer, indicating that I'm serious about closing the deal at this price.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate that this price benefits both of us, highlighting the value to Bob while securing my minimum.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes round. Time is running out, and I need to secure a deal. I'm taking a calculated risk by offering my minimum price.  If Bob accepts, I've successfully closed the deal. If he rejects, I still have the option to sell to John for the same price."
