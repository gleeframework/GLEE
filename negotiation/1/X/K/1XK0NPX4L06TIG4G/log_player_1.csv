"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's value of $800,000 but significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially making a profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to see the value in the deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and get Bob to make a counteroffer quickly. If he rejects, I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but not too low, as I have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd ideally like to get.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with some further negotiation.  Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum value, but I'm willing to risk a lower price for the chance of a higher one. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, but still above his offer. I'll try to highlight the value of the product to him and reiterate the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $975,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and ensure we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $975,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's counteroffer and emphasize the value of a compromise. I focus on the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to slowly decrease my offer while still maintaining a price above Bob's value.  I'm hoping that by being reasonable and showing a willingness to negotiate, I can reach a mutually acceptable price in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am willing to pay $960000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum at this stage. I still have 6 rounds left, and there's potential to get a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum. I will emphasize the value of the product and reiterate the potential for a long-term partnership."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $960,000.  However, considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'd need to come down to $965,000.  This price reflects the value I bring to the table while also giving you a great opportunity.  Let's close this deal and build a successful partnership!"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $965,000, which is a small increase from Bob's offer. This shows that I am willing to compromise, but also that I value the product and won't simply accept his last offer. 
* **Message:**  I maintain a positive tone, highlighting the value of the product and potential for a future partnership. This subtly increases the pressure on Bob to agree.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that by increasing my offer only slightly, I can encourage Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal and accept my counteroffer.  If not, I will continue to negotiate in small increments."
