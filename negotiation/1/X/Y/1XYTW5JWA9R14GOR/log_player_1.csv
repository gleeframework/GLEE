"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Future Rounds:** This strategy keeps the offer far from John's guaranteed $1,500,000, allowing you to gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds while aiming to secure a deal significantly higher than Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still considerably lower than your target price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and John's offer provides a strong safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Decrease:** We're lowering the price by $250,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value, aiming to justify the price and prevent lowball counteroffers.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps you in a strong negotiating position. You're moving closer to Bob's range but leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive with my offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating serious interest. However, $1,900,000 is still below your $2,000,000 from the previous round and significantly under your target. With six rounds remaining, you have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap.  John's offer provides a safety net if Bob doesn't meet your expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,975,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the product's exceptional value."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller price reduction of $25,000. This shows Bob you're willing to move but are getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Justification:**  The message highlights this as a ""significant concession"" and reiterates the product's value to justify the price.
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts a bit of pressure on Bob. He's now very close to your counteroffer, and further negotiation might only yield small increments. This could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $1,950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,950,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above both Bob's initial perceived value and your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, the potential gains are likely to be small. Bob is signaling that he's near his limit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a highly favorable outcome."
