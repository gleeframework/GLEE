Alice's counteroffer is closer to your initial counteroffer, but still too high.  Rejecting again shows you're serious about getting a better price and opens the door for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise, but still want a better price than Alice's latest offer. It's a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal while remaining within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is still higher than you'd like, it's only $250 more than your last counteroffer. You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and going back and forth further might risk Alice getting impatient and walking away.  Accepting the offer is the best choice, saving you $750 compared to buying from John."
