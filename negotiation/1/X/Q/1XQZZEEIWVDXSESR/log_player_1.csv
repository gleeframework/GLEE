{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a strategic opening price. It's high enough that I still make a decent profit, but low enough to be tempting to Bob, who values the product at $800,000. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high to go that low. How about $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a little lower than my initial offer, but still higher than what Bob offered. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'd prefer.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can push the price closer to my desired price point. John is still an option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still too far below my valuation.  Let's split the difference -  how about $850,000?  I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm aiming for a final compromise that's closer to my desired price point. This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer, showing that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
