Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

There's no need to risk going further in the negotiation. Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, and it's better to secure the deal now.  We might be able to squeeze out a bit more, but it's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer or walking away."
