"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is under your $15,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. You know John will sell it for $15,000, giving you leverage. Alice may be willing to come down closer to her $12,000 valuation."
