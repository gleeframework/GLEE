Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given the market value and my budget, I would like to propose $9600 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether makes accepting his offer the best choice."
