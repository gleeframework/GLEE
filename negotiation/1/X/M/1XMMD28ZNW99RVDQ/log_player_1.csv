I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I understand this is a big difference, but I'm hoping we can find a way to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1600000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us. Selling to John ensures I receive the product's full value."
