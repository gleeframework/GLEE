Alice's price is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

While Alice has come down somewhat, she's still above your target. It's clear she's not willing to budge much further, and you're risking getting stuck in a long negotiation. It's best to go with John's offer and secure the product at your desired price."
