Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $1050000 is closer, it's still below the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest and the potential of this product for your business, $1000000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and I believe it will prove to be a sound investment for you.

I think I've negotiated as far as I can with Alice. I'll reject her offer and decide to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, since it's the maximum I'm willing to pay.
