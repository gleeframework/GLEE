Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe the product has potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
