"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe the product has potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $1050000 is closer, it's still below the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest and the potential of this product for your business, $1000000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and I believe it will prove to be a sound investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
