"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. This leaves room for further negotiation, while also showing Bob's seriousness in wanting to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $10,000 is within Bob's budget and a significantly better deal than John's $12,000. While there's always the potential to negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking the deal falling through or having to pay more to John."
