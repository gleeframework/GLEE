"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to finalize the transaction.",10000.0,Alice,3,
