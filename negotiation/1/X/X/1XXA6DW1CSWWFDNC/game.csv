"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 unfortunately falls below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while respecting your budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
