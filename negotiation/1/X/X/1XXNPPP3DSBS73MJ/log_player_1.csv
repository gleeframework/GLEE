Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,450,000 is a bit high.

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal, exceeding John's offer by $50,000."
