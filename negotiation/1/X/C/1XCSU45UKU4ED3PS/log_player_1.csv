{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation high, aiming for a good deal for myself.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum value and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'll use my knowledge of the product's value and John's offer as leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm open to selling for $1,750,000. This reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $1750000.  Would you be open to a price of $1500000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now equal to the price John is willing to pay. There's no incentive to keep negotiating, as I'm not likely to get a better price from Bob. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away."
