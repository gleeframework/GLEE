Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I began by offering the product at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is phrased in a way that invites Bob to counter-offer if he'd like. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering the product at $12,000 represents a significant profit for me while still being an attractive deal for Bob. There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward justifies it."
