"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about $15,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is too low for you, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good opportunity for you to own it. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $14,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to offer $14,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",14200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $14,200 is still a little too low. Let's split the difference, how about $14,350? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",14350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,350 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,250 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",14250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $14,250 is very close, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $14,300? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",14300.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,300. I'm willing to offer $14,200 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10,000.",14200.0,Bob,10,
