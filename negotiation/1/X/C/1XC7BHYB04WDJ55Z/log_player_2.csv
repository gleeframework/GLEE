"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear no-brainer. Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget. It's much better to reject and start a counter-negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This is your maximum budget, and you are making it clear you are serious about buying if Alice is willing to meet you there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is getting closer, but $9,500 is still above your limit.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

You're pushing for a lower price, but you're also showing flexibility. This counteroffer is still within your budget and demonstrates you're willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still outside your ideal range. You have rounds left, and pushing for a slightly lower price is still worth it.  You're close to your target and can potentially save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly to demonstrate your willingness to negotiate, but still staying within your budget and pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,900 is very close to your target, you've only got 3 rounds left.  There's still a chance you can get Alice to budge a bit more. You're not too far off from your ideal price, but there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly, showing you're willing to meet her halfway, but still holding firm to your budget.  You're now in a position where you can see if she'll accept your offer, or you can move on to John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call.  You've only got one round left, and you're close to your target. While $8,850 is slightly above your ideal price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting and ending the negotiation, rather than risking losing the deal altogether with John."
