"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and it's still within my budget.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000, which is still a great compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
