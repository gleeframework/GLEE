"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it at a starting price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and still potentially achieve a price higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if the initial offer is rejected, it sets a psychological benchmark that can influence subsequent offers and counteroffers.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate the offer, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle for $950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Ground:**  We've significantly reduced our price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, we're still holding firm above both Bob's offer and our minimum price. 
* **Strategic Target:** $950,000 allows for further negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're on round 3 of 10. While we don't want to rush, it's good to keep the negotiation moving and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a little steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend, But Still Too Low:** Bob's offer is increasing, which is a positive sign. However, $700,000 remains significantly below both our $1,000,000 minimum and our previous counteroffer. 
* **Negotiating Position:** We're still in a relatively strong negotiating position.  We have a guaranteed offer from John, and we're not pressed for time. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we can gauge how much further Bob is willing to go.  It's possible he's holding back and might make a more substantial jump in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from our previous price and puts us closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Without Panic):** While we still have rounds to spare, this move conveys a desire to close the deal without giving away too much, too quickly. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $875,000 is a more specific number than a round figure. This can sometimes be perceived as a more carefully considered and ""final"" offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget.  I could meet you at $750,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's use of ""final offer"" is a common negotiation tactic to try to force our hand.  It doesn't necessarily mean he won't negotiate further, but it's a strong signal.
* **Unlikely to Bridge the Gap:**  While Bob has steadily increased his offer, he's still substantially below our $1,000,000 minimum.  It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds, especially given his ""final offer"" statement. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer, or even worse, no deal at all."
