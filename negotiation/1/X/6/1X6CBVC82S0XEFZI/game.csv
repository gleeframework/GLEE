Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a very unique product, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, considering my budget and the fact that I'm looking for a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's unique value and the effort that went into creating it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit over my limit. I'm prepared to offer $825000, which I believe is a fair price considering my constraints and the value we've discussed.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $825000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $845000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",845000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $845000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product and the price I'm willing to pay, I'm offering $830000 as my final offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",830000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go below $850000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $837500. This is my final counteroffer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",837500.0,Alice,7,
