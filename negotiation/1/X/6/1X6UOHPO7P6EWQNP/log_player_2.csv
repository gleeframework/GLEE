"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $80. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to proceed with the purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $80, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. Bob can get the same product for the same price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to maintain his budget."
