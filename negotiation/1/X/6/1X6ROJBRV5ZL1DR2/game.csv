"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This price is fair and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while being reasonable for the value you'll receive.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $750,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. ",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support for the product, which will provide you with added value and peace of mind. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $850,000, but I believe the extras will make it a more attractive offer for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer of additional benefits, but I'm still focused on finding the right price for the product itself.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,6,
