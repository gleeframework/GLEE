"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with the price of $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would that work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? That's the lowest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again, at $100? That way, we can both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $92. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $92, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell it to you for $95, and that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $92, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92.5, which is the absolute limit for me. Can you consider that?",92.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $92.5. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $97.50? That's as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",97.5,Alice,9,
