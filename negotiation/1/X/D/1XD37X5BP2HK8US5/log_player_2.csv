It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer.  While you could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to get the price much lower than $11,000.  At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees you get the product and avoids potentially wasting more time."
