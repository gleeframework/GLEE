{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, leaving some room for negotiation but still securing a good profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Backup plan:** I have John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $800,000 is my minimum, it doesn't leave me much room for profit. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's message indicates a willingness to compromise, suggesting there's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Step:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $800,000, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving down from $950,000.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $850,000 is a fair middle ground, leaving both of us with some profit.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate the deal's attractiveness.
* **Open communication:**  I'm again inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation going.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while ensuring I still get a profit that's significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. Let's see if we can shake hands on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited negotiating room:** Bob has shown a reluctance to go higher, suggesting there might not be much room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to further negotiation rounds and potentially a lower final price, or even Bob walking away completely.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if I accept Bob's offer, I'm still getting a better deal than selling to John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $825,000 is the most logical choice considering the current circumstances. It's a reasonable price, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I continue to negotiate."
