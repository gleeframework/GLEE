{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a unique item that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  It's also important to frame the message positively and highlight the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount, as it saves me the trouble of a separate transaction."
