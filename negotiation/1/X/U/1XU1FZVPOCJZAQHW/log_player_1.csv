Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still push for a higher offer, given the value Bob places on the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Let's meet halfway at $1,025,000.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would love to get closer to my ideal price, $1,010,000 is a very good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the fact that I can always sell to John for $800,000.  It's important to close the deal and avoid further negotiations that might lead to a lower offer or even no deal."
