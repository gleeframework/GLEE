Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a profit while still potentially appealing to Bob. It's also a good starting point for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm not comfortable with $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to aim for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too far below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is still a good profit for me.  It's also close enough to my initial offer that further negotiation might not be productive.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
