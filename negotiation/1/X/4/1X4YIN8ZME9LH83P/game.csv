"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to come up a little if you're willing to come down a little.  How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that last offer doesn't feel like we're moving towards a deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, but if we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider John's offer.",10500.0,Bob,8,
