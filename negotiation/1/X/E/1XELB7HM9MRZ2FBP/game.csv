"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $850,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $950,000?  That would be a good compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.  If you're not able to accept, I will unfortunately have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
