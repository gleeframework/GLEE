"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?,125.0,Bob,4,
