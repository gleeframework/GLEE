"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen!",115.0,Bob,4,
