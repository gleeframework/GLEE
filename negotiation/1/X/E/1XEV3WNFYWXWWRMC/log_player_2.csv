"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to start the negotiations at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price from Alice first. $14,000 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product would be valuable to me, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It acknowledges Alice's initial offer while firmly stating my budget limitations. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  How about we settle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This counter-offer aims for a price point closer to my target while still being reasonable for Alice. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also firm on not overpaying. Let's see if she agrees."
