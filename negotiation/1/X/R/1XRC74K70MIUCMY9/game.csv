"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
