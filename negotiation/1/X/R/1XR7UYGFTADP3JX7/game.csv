"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I understand that it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise further. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9500. I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
