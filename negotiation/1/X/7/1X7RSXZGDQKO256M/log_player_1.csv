Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $100, which is your minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear opening:** The message is friendly and sets the stage for potential negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, you leave room to potentially make a small concession later if needed. Remember, you also have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $95 if possible. I believe it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price of $100.  It's worth trying to push for a better deal with Bob before settling. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, keeping in mind you always have the option to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a good move because:

* **It's a compromise:** You've moved from your initial offer of $115 to $105, showing flexibility. 
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're holding firm on your minimum price of $100.
* **It's a clear message:** The message reiterates your willingness to negotiate, but also your need to make a profit.

This approach gives Bob the feeling that you're open to a deal, but you're not willing to settle for an unreasonable price. You're also still leaving the door open to sell to John for $100 if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 meets your minimum price, and you have the option to sell to John for the same amount.  While you'd prefer to earn more, there's no guarantee that you'll get a better offer in the future, and the negotiation could potentially drag on. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice to ensure a guaranteed sale and avoid potential risk."
