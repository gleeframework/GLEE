"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $145.**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $5."
