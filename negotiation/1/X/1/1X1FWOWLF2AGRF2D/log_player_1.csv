"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" the message subtly justifies the high price without explicitly stating the product is worth that much.
* **Open-ended:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just saying yes or no. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential:** There's a chance Bob might accept the initial high price.
* **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will indicate how far apart your valuations are and how aggressively he'll negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob moved closer to your desired range, $1,300,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are eight rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better deal. Bob's willingness to counter indicates he's motivated to purchase.
* **John as Leverage:**  The guaranteed offer from John provides a strong safety net. You can afford to negotiate firmly with Bob, knowing you have a backup plan. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're seeking a price closer to your valuation while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below the market value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While we want to move closer to Bob's range, it's important to hold firm to a price that reflects the product's value to you. A drop to $1,800,000 shows flexibility but not desperation.
* **Market Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly anchor the negotiation around a higher price point without directly revealing your minimum. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to meet you closer to the middle. His response will indicate his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to your minimum of $1,500,000. However, it's still worth negotiating further.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Rejecting at this stage keeps the pressure on Bob and shows you're serious about getting a fair price. It's possible he'll increase his offer significantly in the next round. 
* **John as Security:** You still have the option of selling to John for your desired price. This allows you to confidently reject Bob's offer and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for this product. This offer represents a significant concession on my part and is a very competitive price for something of this value."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down to $1,600,000 is a significant move that signals you're serious about closing the deal. However, it still keeps you above your absolute minimum.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Emphasizing this as a ""significant concession"" and a ""competitive price"" reinforces the value proposition for Bob.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  By framing it as ""finding a solution,"" you promote a collaborative tone and nudge Bob towards accepting this offer. 

This offer aims to:

* **Close the Deal:** The price is attractive enough to entice Bob, especially given the limited rounds remaining.
* **Maintain Profitability:** You're still securing a substantial profit above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches your minimum acceptable price and the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Value of Money:** While you could try to push for slightly more, there's a risk Bob might reduce his offer in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures the deal at your desired price.
* **Reduced Risk:**  By accepting, you eliminate the uncertainty of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away. 

Overall, accepting Bob's offer at $1,500,000 is the most logical decision at this stage. You've successfully negotiated a favorable outcome that meets your financial goals."
