{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's a good deal, but there's room for negotiation.  You're looking to save as much as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice I'm serious about saving money. It's important to note that this is just a starting point, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming to save more. There's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. This demonstrates flexibility while still attempting to secure a price closer to my desired range. The goal is to find a middle ground with Alice and hopefully close the deal before needing to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'm closer to my ideal range, but I'm confident I can push for a lower price, especially with 5 rounds remaining. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This counteroffer is only $25,000 away from Alice's offer, indicating a significant movement towards a deal. I believe this is a fair offer and I'm hoping Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'll need to reassess my strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my last counteroffer.  With only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. It's more likely that Alice will dig in her heels and refuse to go lower, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price.  While $815,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a good deal compared to John's price, and it ensures I secure the product without risking the negotiation falling apart."
