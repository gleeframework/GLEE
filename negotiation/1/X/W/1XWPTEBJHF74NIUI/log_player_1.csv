"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible, but I also want to keep the deal open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still trying to stay above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get Bob to go higher, but if he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm continuing to slowly decrease my price, trying to find the sweet spot where Bob is willing to pay and I'm still getting a decent price. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm not giving up yet. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm starting to get nervous.  It's risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers, as I'm running out of rounds. However, I'm willing to risk it one more time and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob. I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. If he rejects this, I'll finally sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is not willing to budge much. I've tried to negotiate as much as possible, but I'm not confident I can get a better deal with him. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
