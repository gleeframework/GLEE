"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,020,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe the product is worth more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I do like to get a good deal!  How about we split the difference and settle at $985,000?  That's a fair price and we can both walk away happy.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $985,000 is a fair price for this product, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,007,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1007500.0,Alice,7,
