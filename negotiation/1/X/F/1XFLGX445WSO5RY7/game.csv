"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price around that range?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $13,000, which would be $11,750. Can we consider that price?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,750 is still too high for me.  How about $10,000?  This would give you a healthy profit and allow me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,7,
