"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is above my maximum valuation. There's room for negotiation to reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:** I've started with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully settle closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000, which is $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to my acceptable price range, $12,500 is still above my budget. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11750}

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price below my $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. How about we meet at $12,200? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably in price, and $12,200 is within my acceptable range, even if it's slightly above John's offer.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal from Alice at this point, and I'd rather secure the product now than risk further negotiation."
