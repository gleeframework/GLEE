Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's unreasonable.  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also leaves room for me to make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, I can do better. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.  I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product, and $1,000,000 is simply not enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm going to be a bit more firm this time.  I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to what I need. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that John is waiting in the wings."
