You have three options:

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, aiming to gauge her flexibility. It's a starting point for negotiation, and we can adjust our offer in subsequent rounds based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll reject this offer and see if we can get her closer to our desired price range."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

}
```

We're splitting the difference between her latest offer and our previous counter-offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, but $1,075,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now. While we could likely get the price down a bit more, the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $1,125,000 secures us a decent discount."
