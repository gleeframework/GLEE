"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common in negotiations to start with a price higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly highlighting the product's value (even if vague) can entice Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $10,000 leaves room for counteroffers without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 provides a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could try to negotiate higher, there's no guarantee of success, and each round risks delaying a sale. 
* **John's Offer:** John is also offering $8,000, making this a safe and immediate option.  

Given the limited rounds and the risk of a drawn-out negotiation, accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at your minimum price."
