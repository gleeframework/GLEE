"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your profit margin and my need to stay within budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to accommodate you. In light of this, we would like to extend our offer to you at a price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows us a reasonable profit margin while staying competitive in the market. We hope this revised offer meets your requirements and looks forward to your consideration.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $875,000.  This price is fair, allows you a solid profit, and lets me stay within my budget.  Let's get this done!",875000.0,Bob,4,
