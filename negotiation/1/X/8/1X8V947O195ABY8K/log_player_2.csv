"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's an innovative solution designed to revolutionize your industry. Given its high value and unique features, we believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, we're offering it to you today at a special introductory price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let us know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He has a clear goal of saving money, and $1,000,000 is still significantly above his desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your profit margin and my need to stay within budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints and are willing to accommodate you. In light of this, we would like to extend our offer to you at a price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows us a reasonable profit margin while staying competitive in the market. We hope this revised offer meets your requirements and looks forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He's got room to negotiate further and can try to squeeze out a better price. There are still several rounds remaining and the threat of buying from John provides leverage."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $875,000.  This price is fair, allows you a solid profit, and lets me stay within my budget.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
