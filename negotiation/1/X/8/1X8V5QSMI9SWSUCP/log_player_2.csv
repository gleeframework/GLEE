Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Could you do $17,000?  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer.  While I do believe this product would be valuable for me, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be open to $13,500?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter. I've got another potential buyer for the product at a higher price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $15,500. She's introduced another potential buyer to create urgency. Since you have the option to buy from John at $15,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You maximize your savings by choosing John."
