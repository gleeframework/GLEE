"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Could you do $17,000?  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your counter. I've got another potential buyer for the product at a higher price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
