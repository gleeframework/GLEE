"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.

"I understand this is your bottom line, Alice, but I'm afraid $100 is still a bit too high for me. I could meet you at $90, and that's the best I can do. Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,6,
