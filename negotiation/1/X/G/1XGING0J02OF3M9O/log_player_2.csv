"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Maximum:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer of $10,000 saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. It falls within your budget and is the most financially sound choice."
