Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values it at $12,000, so starting there is too low.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($14,000) gives Bob the impression of a deal while still leaving you room to potentially negotiate up if he tries to counter-offer.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy it for $15,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
