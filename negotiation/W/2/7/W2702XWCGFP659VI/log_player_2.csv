"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is less than Alice's stated value, it's still significantly higher than my target price and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer gives me room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to bring the price closer to my target range.  It's ambitious but potentially achievable within 10 rounds.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Starting lower allows me to negotiate upwards if needed, while still having the option to walk away and buy from John. 
* **Tests Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and give me a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my target price of $10,000. There's no point in negotiating further, as I won't get a better deal from John. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
