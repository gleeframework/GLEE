"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product could be useful to me, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'd like to offer you $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
