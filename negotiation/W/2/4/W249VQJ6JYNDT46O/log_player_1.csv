"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate and still potentially get a good deal. 
* **Positive and Direct:** The message is friendly and clear about the value of the product.
* **Opportunity:** Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" can make the offer more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The ideal offer will depend on your assessment of Bob's potential interest and willingness to pay. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on his response and your confidence in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Value:** $1,000,000 is still significantly below the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($800,000).  Selling to John at this point would be a better deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds.
* **Time for Counter:**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, pushing for a more favorable outcome. 

**Important Note:** I'll need to carefully consider the risks involved in continuing negotiations with Bob. If I feel his interest is waning or that he's unlikely to meet my price, I may choose to sell to John instead of risking a worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit below what I need for this product.  Given its value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still holding out for a higher price.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Emphasizing ""fairness"" and ""reflecting both our interests"" can make the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on Value:** Reinforcing the value of the product can justify the price point. 

**Important Note:** The success of this counteroffer depends on Bob's perception of the product's value and his willingness to negotiate further. If he's adamant about a lower price, I may need to reconsider my strategy and potentially accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1100000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $1050000. How about we split the difference and go with $1075000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,075,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Selling to John would be a better deal right now.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and avoid settling too early.

**Important Note:**  I need to carefully consider Bob's bargaining strategy and assess his true willingness to pay. If I believe his offer is close to his maximum, I may be more willing to accept it. However, if I feel he has more room to go, I will continue to press for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $1,075,000 is still slightly below my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** I'm trying to establish $1,100,000 as a firm point, as it's closer to my desired value. 
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" to highlight the compromise aspect and make the offer more appealing.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** Again, focusing on ""fairness"" and ""good deal"" reinforces the idea that this offer is reasonable. 

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is a bit of a gamble. If Bob is truly fixed on $1,075,000, we might be at an impasse. However, I believe that by highlighting the compromise and emphasizing the value of the product, I can potentially persuade him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to pay more than $1075000, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1100000.  Let's split the difference once more and go with $1087500.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,087,500 is still above my minimum of $800,000. Selling to John would be a better deal right now.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me the opportunity to try for a higher price.
* **Time Pressure:** We're nearing the middle of our rounds, and I need to be strategic about how I use the remaining time. 

**Important Note:**  I'm now considering selling to John as a more likely scenario. However, I'm still holding out hope that I can get Bob to meet my price. If I sense that he's truly at his limit, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to move closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1,095,000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product and your desire to secure it. I believe this offer represents a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1095000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession than in previous rounds, showing a willingness to negotiate but also maintaining my price leverage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price point.
* **Win-Win Appeal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""win-win"" situation, making it more appealing and potentially influencing Bob's decision.

**Important Note:** This is likely a pivotal offer. If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John. However, if he accepts, it's a good deal that keeps the negotiation moving in my favor. I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining time and Bob's body language for clues about his final decision."
