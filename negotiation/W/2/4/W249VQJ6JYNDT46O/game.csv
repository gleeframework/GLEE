"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit below what I need for this product.  Given its value, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1100000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $1050000. How about we split the difference and go with $1075000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $1075000 is still slightly below my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? It's a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to pay more than $1075000, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1100000.  Let's split the difference once more and go with $1087500.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1087500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to move closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1095000. This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product and your desire to secure it. I believe this offer represents a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",1095000.0,Alice,7,
