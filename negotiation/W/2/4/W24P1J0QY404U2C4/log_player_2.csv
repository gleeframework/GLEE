"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price.  There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product. This would still be a substantial profit for you and a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $875000, which is still a significant profit for me and a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good deal for you. You are saving $125,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to squeeze a bit more out with another counteroffer, the risk of her rejecting it and driving the price up is not worth it."
