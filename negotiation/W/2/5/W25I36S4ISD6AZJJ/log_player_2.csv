"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment for someone like you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  Given its value to me, I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,100,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while ensuring a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down in price, there is still room to negotiate.  He can likely get closer to his desired price of $1,050,000 by rejecting and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. Would you consider $1,075,000?  I believe this price represents a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,090,000 for this to make sense on my end.  How about we settle at $1,095,000 and finally close this deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price.  While $1,095,000 is a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it is still a good deal compared to buying from John at $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, so accepting this offer is the best option."
