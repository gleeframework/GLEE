"Thanks for your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,5,
