"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $140.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $135. This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $135 is still a little low for me. How about we settle on $138? This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen! ",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $136.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a profit.",136.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $136.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again at $137. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident this will be a great deal for both of us. What do you say? ",137.0,Alice,7,
