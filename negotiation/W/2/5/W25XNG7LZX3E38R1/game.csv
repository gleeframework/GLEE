"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $109. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $120. Let's find a way to make this work!",109.0,Alice,5,
