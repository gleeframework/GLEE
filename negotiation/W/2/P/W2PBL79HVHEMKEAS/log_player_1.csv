"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I'm not immediately giving away too much.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. This helps build a positive rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. I'm keeping an eye on the clock and my fallback option of selling to John, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price.  I still have several rounds left and can leverage the fact that I can always sell to John for a higher amount.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll need to be careful not to be too aggressive, but also make sure I don't settle for a price that leaves me feeling dissatisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product invaluable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while maintaining a position of strength.
* **Message:** The message is polite yet firm, reminding Bob of the product's value and reiterating the potential for a beneficial agreement. This helps build a positive tone for continuing negotiations.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to slowly decrease the price while still staying within my acceptable range. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob gets a good deal, and I get a fair price for my product. The option of selling to John provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's message expresses interest and a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I still have several rounds left and haven't reached the point where selling to John is the best option.  However, I'll need to be mindful of the time remaining and the potential risk of losing the deal entirely if I continue to reject Bob's offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair profit for me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer is a further compromise, bringing the price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while reiterating my finality, creating a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

I'm  aiming to secure a deal within this round, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm being firm but fair, creating pressure on Bob to accept. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John if negotiations fail,  but this option is becoming less desirable as time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is expressing a desire to make a deal and has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

Despite the limited time remaining, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John, as this becomes a more attractive option as the rounds decrease."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer.  I'm now offering the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Please consider this my final offer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,450,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,200,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my commitment to finding a solution and highlighting the fairness of the offer. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I need to be more assertive while still being open to a compromise. This counteroffer is a significant concession but still allows me to make a decent profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John as the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing. I've already made substantial concessions, and his unwillingness to budge any further signals a stalemate.  Given the time pressure and the fact that John is offering a price well above my minimum, it's strategically sound to sell to John and secure the sale.

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I guarantee a significant profit and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely with Bob. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob at a higher price, the limited time and Bob's resistance leave me with no other viable option."
