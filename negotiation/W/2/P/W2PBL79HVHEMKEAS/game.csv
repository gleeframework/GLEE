"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product invaluable. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my means.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,450,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a fair profit for me. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let me know if you're interested.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer.  I'm now offering the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Please consider this my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
