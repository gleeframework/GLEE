"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $7,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,200 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
