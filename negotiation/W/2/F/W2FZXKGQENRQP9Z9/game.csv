"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider this price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin for the product. I am proposing a price of $160. This allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $145, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",145.0,Bob,4,
