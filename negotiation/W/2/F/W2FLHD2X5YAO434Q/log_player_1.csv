"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm being friendly and confident, hoping to build a positive rapport.
* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 as possible in the first round, knowing that I have options if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price this early in the process.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $120 is halfway between my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to compromise but not at the expense of my bottom line.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $120 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, aiming to keep the negotiation constructive and open to a resolution."
