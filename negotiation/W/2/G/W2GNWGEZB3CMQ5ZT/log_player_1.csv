This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above my minimum value but still leaves room for potential compromise. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept, but I'm ready to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I don't settle for too low of a price.  I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can do $12,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is above my minimum of $12,000 and is a good compromise, considering we started much further apart. I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
