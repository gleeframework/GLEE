"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would still leave you with a good deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can agree on this.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can do $12,200. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12200.0,Bob,4,
