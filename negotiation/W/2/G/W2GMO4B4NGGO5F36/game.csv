"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it offers.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't accurately reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think the product's value is lower than you're suggesting. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits it offers.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I believe $1,025,000 is still too low. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,037,500?  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of the product.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
