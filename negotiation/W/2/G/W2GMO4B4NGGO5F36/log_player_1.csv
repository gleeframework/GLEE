Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it offers.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,015,000, which is closer to my target. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer at this point.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
