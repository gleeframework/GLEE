Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and the potential to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I will counteroffer Bob and aim for a price closer to my desired value. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your interest in the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, but I'll remain prepared to either negotiate further or sell to John if necessary."
