"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $125 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  Starting with a lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it sets a strong point in favor of getting a lower price.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chance of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met in the middle, there's likely space for her to come down a little further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John's offer as a backup provides leverage. It means we don't have to accept an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $112.50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $105.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $105 shows willingness to compromise but still holds a strong position.
* **Clear Target:** This counteroffer signals our desired price range to Alice.
* **Maintaining Respect:**  We continue to be polite and understanding of Alice's position, which fosters a positive negotiation environment."
