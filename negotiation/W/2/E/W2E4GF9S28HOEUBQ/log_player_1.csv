Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good chance of getting a fair price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $125 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can do better than that. I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $112.50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $105.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 below my initial counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
