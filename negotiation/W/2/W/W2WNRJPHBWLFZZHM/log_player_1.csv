Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and I'm sure you'll benefit from it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal, even though it's very close to his maximum. 
* **Secure the Sale:**  While we have John as a backup, it's better to secure the higher price from Bob if possible."
