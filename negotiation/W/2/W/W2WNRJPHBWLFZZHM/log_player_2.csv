"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's of great value and I'm sure you'll benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $119, while John is asking for $120.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money while still getting the product."
