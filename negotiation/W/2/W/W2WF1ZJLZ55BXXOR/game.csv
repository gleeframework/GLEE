"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table.
