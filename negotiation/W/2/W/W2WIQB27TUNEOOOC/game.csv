"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,050,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and we've been going back and forth on this.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $1,000,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth. This is my final offer - I hope you'll consider it carefully.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
