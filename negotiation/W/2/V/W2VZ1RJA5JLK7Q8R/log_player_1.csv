Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll see if I can get a better counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $10,200?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,200 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
