"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $10,200?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",10200.0,Bob,4,
