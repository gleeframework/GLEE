"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a little bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
