"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and even higher than her own product valuation.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Not Too Low:** While we start low, $6,000 is still a reasonable distance from both your $8,000 maximum and Alice's $10,000 valuation. It avoids insulting Alice with a ridiculously low offer.

This counter-offer aims to move the negotiation closer to a price point that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 limit.  There's room for further negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a little bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only by $1,000. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Justification:**  We're giving a soft reason (""a little bit of a stretch"") without revealing our absolute maximum budget.
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a positive and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation collaborative. 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between your target price and Alice's desired price while signaling that you're serious about purchasing the product if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering the product for $8,200, which is above your $8,000 maximum budget.  While she's come down significantly from her initial offer, it seems unlikely she'll go lower than her current price. You can reliably buy the product from John for $8,000, meeting your budget. 

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
