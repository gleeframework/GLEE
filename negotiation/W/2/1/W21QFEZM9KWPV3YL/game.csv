"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $700,000, which would be $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?  It's a significant investment for me, and that's where I'm comfortable.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
