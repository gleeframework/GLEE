Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with its performance. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to start high, a price too far from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might discourage him entirely. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer clearly signals willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, Alice has John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000.  This provides a strong alternative if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is already above his perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Below Alice's Minimum:**  Alice's minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000. Accepting $900,000 would be a significant loss.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has the security of selling to John for her minimum price. This allows her to negotiate more confidently with Bob."

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects my product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice signals flexibility by making a significant reduction from her initial offer, moving closer to Bob's range.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing a price exactly in the middle of their last offers often feels fair to both parties and can help facilitate a deal. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Alice subtly reinforces the product's worth, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial $800,000 valuation.
* **Maintaining Strong Position:** While conceding, Alice is still significantly above both Bob's offer and his perceived value, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers are moving up slowly, indicating he's likely willing to go higher.
* **Still Below Value:**  $950,000 is still significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price and represents a considerable loss compared to selling to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might walk away, Alice has a strong negotiating position with John as a backup. The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob outweighs the risk at this point."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000  falls short of what I can accept for the product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value this product offers. "",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Alice sets a firm boundary by stating this is her final offer and bottom line, adding a sense of urgency. 
* **Justified Price:**  Alice re-emphasizes the product's value, justifying her position without directly referencing Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer gives Bob a final chance while still keeping Alice well above his perceived value and closer to her guaranteed offer from John.
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** Depending on Bob's response, Alice is well-positioned to either finalize a deal above his initial valuation or walk away and sell to John without significant losses."
