Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Consider Your Alternative:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($800,000), so we don't want to go too low initially.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while also ensuring you don't undervalue the product."
