"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While your offer is tempting, I know how transformative this product can be and  $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I would like to pay. I want to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $987,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your commitment to finding a fair price. Let's settle this right now â€“ $1,000,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer of $1,000,000. While this is still above my target price, it's closer than the other options.  If I reject this offer, it's likely we'll just go back and forth with counteroffers, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most strategic move."
