"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a confident and positive message sets the tone for a potentially successful negotiation. 
* **Ambitious but Realistic Anchor:** The initial price ($2,200,000) is significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates a strong anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this price outright, it gives you more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** The message invites Bob's feedback, allowing you to gauge his initial reaction and adjust your strategy in subsequent rounds.

**Important:** 

It's crucial to remember you have the John option ($1,500,000 guaranteed). Throughout the negotiation, you need to weigh the potential of getting a higher price from Bob against the risk of him walking away, leaving you with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  This is my maximum, considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his message suggests this is his ""maximum,"" it's unlikely he'd walk away immediately. There's room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would be leaving a lot of money on the table.

You have the security of John's offer, so there's no pressure to accept a lowball offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  Its value far exceeds that.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant adjustment on my end, reflecting my eagerness to work with you. Let's make this happen."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** You acknowledge Bob's counter-offer to show you're listening, but you remain firm that his initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a significant concession by reducing the price by $300,000. However, you're still anchoring the negotiation well above both Bob's offer and your minimum price.
* **Urgency and Positivity:** By using phrases like ""Let's make this happen"", you inject a sense of urgency and optimism, encouraging Bob to engage further. 

**Important Considerations:**

* Observe Bob's reaction to this offer closely. Does he seem more open to negotiation now?
* Be prepared to make smaller concessions in subsequent rounds, but always try to keep the negotiations anchored above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my financial limitations. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as a genuine attempt to bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased significantly, but it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his message emphasizes his effort to find a compromise, you still hold a strong position with John's guaranteed offer.

You have six rounds remaining, and Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards suggests there's potential for a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It demonstrates your serious interest in this product.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the significant value this product holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging Bob's increased offer and framing it as ""serious interest"" encourages him to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Meeting ""halfway"" might seem like a big concession, but it's a calculated move. You're still well above your minimum and have moved closer to Bob's range. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of what he stands to gain and justifies the price. 

**Important for Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response is Key:**  How he reacts to $1,600,000 will reveal a lot about his flexibility. If he's still hesitant, you may need to decide how much more you're willing to compromise.
* **John as Leverage:**  While not mentioned explicitly, having John's offer in your back pocket allows you to be firmer. If Bob's counter is still too low, you can hint that you have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still not able to meet that price. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents my final offer. I believe this is a fair price that considers both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Limited Rounds:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only four rounds remaining and Bob stating this is his ""final offer,"" the risk of him walking away is higher. 

* **""Final Offer"" Psychology:**  While Bob could be bluffing, there's a good chance he's getting close to his actual limit. Pushing further might make him reconsider the whole deal.

* **Profitable Deal:** Even though it's less than John's offer, $1,200,000 is a significant profit. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
