Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob balks, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's serious about buying and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, but I'm still leaving room for some negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum. While I'd prefer more, it's better to take this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
