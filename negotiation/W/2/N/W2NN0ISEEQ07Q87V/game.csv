"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my desired selling price.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,600 for the product. This is a small step down from your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise that we can both agree on.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my desired selling price.",8700.0,Alice,5,
