"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about $10,500? That's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about $10,000? It's a compromise that is closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,000. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
