"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  Let's start with $850000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering your value and my desired price.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs. Let's close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount.  Let's try $875000.  It's a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $890000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal at this price.",890000.0,Alice,5,
