"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your estimated value, it's still quite high. You have 10 rounds and can potentially negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  Let's start with $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering your value and my desired price.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum value. This shows you're serious about negotiating but are also willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message focuses on fairness, highlighting the product's value to both parties. This can help build rapport and encourage Alice to consider your counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by stating you're open to finding a middle ground, keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $900,000 is still above where you'd like to be. You have time and opportunities for further negotiation. Rejecting allows you to potentially push for a price closer to your desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount.  Let's try $875,000.  It's a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Framing as a Compromise:** The message emphasizes that the offer is a ""good compromise"" that will get both parties closer to an agreement.
* **Open Question:** Ending with a question keeps the dialogue open and encourages Alice to respond positively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $875000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $890000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Rejecting it risks the deal falling through entirely.
* **Close to Your Target:** $890,000 is very close to your desired price point and significantly lower than John's offer. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the most secure way to guarantee getting the product at a good price. 

While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or being stuck with John's higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
