I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some willingness to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping we can find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk a counteroffer that might be even lower, or to sell to John at the same price."
