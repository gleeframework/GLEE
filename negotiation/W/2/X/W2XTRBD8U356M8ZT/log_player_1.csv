Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $115. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $112.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is very slowly inching towards his maximum price. At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will get you significantly closer to your desired price. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob later."
