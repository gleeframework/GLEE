"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while still giving me a fair return on my investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

While $925,000 is close, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again. I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.  We've only had a few rounds, and I'm confident I can get a higher price."

While I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer.  It seems like we're stuck at $900,000, but I'm hoping to convince him to go up just a bit more. If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. 

Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, I've already exhausted my negotiation rounds with Bob and it doesn't seem like we're going to reach an agreement. I'd rather secure a sale with John and ensure I get at least something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
