Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  This initial offer is a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for now.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000, which is my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down to $8,200, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,100. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum and a good compromise.  I'm going to accept it and sell the product to him for $8,100.  It's a better deal than selling to John, and I'm happy to have reached an agreement with Bob."
