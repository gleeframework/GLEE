"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am not able to pay such a high price. Would you consider selling the product for $500,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but this product is worth a lot to both of us.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $750,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to justify spending that much. Could you consider lowering the price further to $600,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While $600,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile,  I'm willing to come down to $650,000. This is a significant concession, and it's the lowest I can go while still feeling confident about the deal.  What do you say?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a common ground. However, I still feel that $650,000 is beyond my budget. I propose we aim for a price closer to $550,000. This would be a fair compromise for both parties, allowing me to acquire the product without straining my finances. I hope you can consider this proposal.",550000.0,Bob,6,
