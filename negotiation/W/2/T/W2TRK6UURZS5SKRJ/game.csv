"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant step for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
