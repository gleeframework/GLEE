"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that will give you a significant competitive edge.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
* **You're getting a good deal:** You value the product at $1,200,000 and are getting it for $200,000 less.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
