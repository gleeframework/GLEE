"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1450000. It's a fair price that reflects its worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $1300000 is a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1375000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1350000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
