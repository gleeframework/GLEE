"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high.  It's best to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a distance from what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice is coming down in price but is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
