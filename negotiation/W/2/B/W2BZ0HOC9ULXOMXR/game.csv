"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a unique item that is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any wiggle room in the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a substantial reduction, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a significant discount from my initial price, and it's also above John's offer, so this is my final offer. I believe we can both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,6,
