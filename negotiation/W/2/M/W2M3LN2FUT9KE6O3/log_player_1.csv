Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer leaves room for me to adjust the price if Bob counters, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the power to walk away from the negotiation if I'm not satisfied with Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'd be willing to buy it from you for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum of $120. While I want to sell the product, I can't afford to accept such a low price.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to counter-offer means there's potential for a compromise. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the power to hold out for a better price without risking losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be very happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to his initial offer, but still higher than my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. I'd be willing to buy it from you for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting. 
* **John Offers a Better Price:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, which is significantly better than the $85 that Bob is offering.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate, where neither of us is willing to budge, and I lose the opportunity to sell to John. 

**Conclusion:** It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed higher price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
