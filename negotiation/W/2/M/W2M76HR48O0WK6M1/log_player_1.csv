Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and emphasizing the ""return on investment"" helps justify the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

By starting high and being confident in your offer, you increase your chances of securing a deal closer to your desired profit margin. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your deal with John."
