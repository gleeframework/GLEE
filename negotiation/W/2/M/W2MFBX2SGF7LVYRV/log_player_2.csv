Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's try to find a middle ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us to both move forward with this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,100,000 and you have a guaranteed option for $1,000,000 with John. There's no point in risking further negotiation."
