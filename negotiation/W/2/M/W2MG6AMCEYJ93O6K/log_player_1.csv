Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I think you'd find it worth considerably more than my asking price. Are you interested in making an offer?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally best to start negotiations with a strong offer.  While $150 is Bob's maximum, starting closer to that figure gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to pique Bob's interest without revealing the price immediately. This allows you to gauge his enthusiasm and potentially get him more invested before presenting the number. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a good chance of securing the sale with Bob."
