"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I think you'd find it worth considerably more than my asking price. Are you interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:** Buying from Alice saves you $10.
* **The product is worth more than $140 to you:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, so Alice's offer is still within your budget. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
