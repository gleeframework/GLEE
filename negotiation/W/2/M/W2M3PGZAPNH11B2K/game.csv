"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to secure the product within my financial constraints.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $9,900 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from its value to you, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.",9900.0,Alice,3,
