"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price. You have room to negotiate and potentially save some money. By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a bit high for me. I want to see if I can get her to come down even further. By rejecting her offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal. It's still cheaper than buying from John, so I'm not in a rush to close the deal."
