Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression of the product's high value.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, even though we know Bob values it at a lower amount initially.
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm adding a psychological element to potentially encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Safety Net:** I know John will buy the product for $1,500,000 if Bob declines, so I'm willing to take a more aggressive initial stance.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts the offer or a price close to it, I significantly exceed my minimum selling price.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how motivated he is to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay. 

This offer is the first step in a negotiation process, and I'm prepared to adjust my approach based on Bob's reaction."
