"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I believe this product will bring you great value, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in this item and would be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What are your thoughts?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $17000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value this product brings. What are your thoughts?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you, Alice, for considering my offer.  $17000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and my budget.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $14000? This is a bit more in line with what I'm looking for, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $14000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product.  I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, $11000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $16000? This is a bit more in line with what I'm looking for, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,7,
