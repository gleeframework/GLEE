Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""message"": ""Thank you, Alice, for considering my offer.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $14000? This is a bit more in line with what I'm looking for, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product.  I hope we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway again. However, $11000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $16000?
