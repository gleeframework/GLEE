"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000, considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle on $14,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get a good price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is closer to where I'm comfortable.  Let's make this deal happen!",13500.0,Bob,6,
