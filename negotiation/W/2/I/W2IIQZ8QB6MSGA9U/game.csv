"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer that takes into account the product's unique benefits.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
