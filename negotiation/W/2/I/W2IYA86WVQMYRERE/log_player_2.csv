Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer of $800,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1,000,000. This is my final offer on the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
