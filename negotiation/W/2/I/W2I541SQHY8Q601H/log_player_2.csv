"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,500,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's definitely worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you agree? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counteroffering again makes sense.  The goal is to get closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
