"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept it immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $10,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering the price to $10,500. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling and willing to compromise. It also keeps the price above my minimum threshold while giving Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I want to push for a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, but I am starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm taking a slight loss from my minimum, but with only 5 rounds left, I need to be decisive.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll have to sell to John."
