{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong opening price, aiming to maximize my profit.  I've also included a message that emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to accept.  However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum desired price. I believe there is potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects this, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.
