"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. How about $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $8500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8000. How about we meet in the middle again, this time between $8000 and $8750? $8375 is a sweet spot for me.",8375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to reach an agreement.  $8375 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference one more time and settle on $8562.50.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",8562.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $8562.50, which would be $8281.25. This is my final offer.",8281.25,Bob,8,
