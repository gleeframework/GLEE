"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,100,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  This allows for some flexibility on both sides and keeps the deal moving forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still not able to meet you at $1,250,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
