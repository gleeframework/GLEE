Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1,100,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  This allows for some flexibility on both sides and keeps the deal moving forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
