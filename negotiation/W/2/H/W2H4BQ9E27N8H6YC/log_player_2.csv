"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000.  I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm currently looking to spend closer to $9,500 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to consider $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better price than $11,000, it's still a bit higher than Bob's desired price point.  Bob has some wiggle room to negotiate further and try to get the price down closer to his target of $9,500.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $9,875 for the product.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9875}
