"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and for valuing the potential of this product.  I've tried to be realistic about its market value, and I need to stay closer to $1,050,000.  I believe that still leaves us some room to negotiate, so I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my best offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,075,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm thinking of $950,000. This is my best offer so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
