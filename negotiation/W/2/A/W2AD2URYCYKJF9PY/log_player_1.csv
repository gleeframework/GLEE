Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and potential benefits of the product for Bob.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, making the negotiation feel collaborative rather than confrontational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I believe there's still room for negotiation, as I have a higher value for the product. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's a bit lower than what I can accept right now. Given the unique value of this product and the potential it holds for your business, I'm confident a price closer to $1,750,000 would be mutually beneficial.  It would leave room for us to both walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I show respect by acknowledging Bob's offer and the factors he considered.
* **Counter with a reasoned justification:**  I justify my counteroffer by highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value for Bob's business.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm willing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not to the extent that I undervalue my own product.
* **Maintain positive and collaborative tone:** I aim to keep the negotiation constructive by asking Bob's opinion and suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1375000. This is my final offer, and I'd appreciate it if you could consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though he claims it's his final offer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is simply too far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm open to finding a compromise that respects both our positions. How about $1,625,000? It's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can offer, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1625000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I show respect for Bob's counteroffer, even though it's not acceptable.
* **Reiterate product value:** I re-emphasize the value of the product to justify my higher counteroffer.
* **Offer a compromise:**  I propose a middle ground price that's closer to my desired value, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on a win-win solution:** I re-emphasize the benefits of the deal for both of us, aiming to find a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think $1625000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I meet my minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk going lower and losing the deal entirely."
