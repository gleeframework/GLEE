,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to give a bit more to get this deal done.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $128 is your highest offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to give a bit more to get this deal done.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $127, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at that price?",127.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that $127 is your highest offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $129? I'm willing to give a bit more to get this deal done.",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $127, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price for this product. I'm not going to make any more offers, so if you're not willing to meet me at $127, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",127.0,Bob,10,
