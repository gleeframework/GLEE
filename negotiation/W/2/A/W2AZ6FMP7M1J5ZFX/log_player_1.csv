"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This allows for some negotiation space while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $12,500. This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects that. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have a firm budget, and $12,000 is the most I can offer. If you're willing to accept this, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great outcome!  Bob has offered my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
