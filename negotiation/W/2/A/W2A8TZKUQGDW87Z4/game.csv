"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product at $1,500,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $825,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value you placed on the product at $1,500,000. If you're still interested, I'm willing to accept $800,000.",800000.0,Alice,5,,
