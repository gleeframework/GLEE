# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects the unique value it offers, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
