Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can do $10,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'll throw in a bonus service that's worth $1,000, so the total value to you would be $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is essentially offering the product for her cost. While the bonus service might be of questionable value, getting the product at her minimum is a win.
* **Time:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. While we could push further, there's a chance Alice won't budge and we'll end up closer to John's price anyway.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from further negotiation are likely small compared to the risk of Alice raising her price or the deal falling through."
