"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides value for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
