"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. Let me see if I can make some adjustments. I'm counteroffering at $11,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very fair throughout this process, and I respect your need to make a profit. To be honest, my budget tops out around $10,500. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I might need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,000, which is still a good deal for you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,7,
