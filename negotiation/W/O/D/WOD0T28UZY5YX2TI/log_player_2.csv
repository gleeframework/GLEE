$200 is far more than your budget. You'll counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is way out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about meeting halfway at $140? This offer stands as a compromise to get us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$140 is still too expensive. You'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  That's a fair price considering my budget and your asking price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's split the difference again - how about $120? This gets us closer to a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than Alice's previous offer, you're still hoping for a lower price. You'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. This is the most I can offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
