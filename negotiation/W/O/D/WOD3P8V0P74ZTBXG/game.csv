"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $14000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and your asking price. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $16200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
