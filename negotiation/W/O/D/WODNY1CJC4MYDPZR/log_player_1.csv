Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not too aggressive and leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially counter with a price closer to my target.
* **Reasoning:** I've included a reason for my pricing to make it seem more reasonable and to start the negotiation in a positive manner. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price while still ensuring I profit more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. While I want to secure the deal with Bob if possible, accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my position and emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, but also stating that my minimum price is $850,000.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John, as continuing to negotiate with Bob might not be worth the time and effort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $800,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value. While I'd prefer to earn more, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time and risk. Accepting his offer allows me to secure the deal and avoid the possibility of Bob backing out entirely.  Furthermore,  selling to John at the same price wouldn't result in any additional profit."
