{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have an alternative buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your openness to negotiation. However, I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price."
