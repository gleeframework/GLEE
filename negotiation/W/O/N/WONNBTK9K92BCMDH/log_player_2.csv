Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $130.  At this point, it makes more financial sense to buy from John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
