"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $8000 at this time. If that's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is a better price than my initial offer, but still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute maximum. If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still outside of my budget. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $12000. This is the very most I can do. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $12000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,7,
