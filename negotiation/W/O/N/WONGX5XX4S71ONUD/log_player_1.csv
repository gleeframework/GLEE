"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have a lot of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

Let's keep the negotiations moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,175,000 is getting closer to what I want, I still feel like I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,175,000 doesn't quite get us there. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product to your business. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced that's the best I can do. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my goal.  I still have a few rounds left to negotiate."
