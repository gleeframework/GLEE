"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be extremely beneficial to your operations.  I'm confident this price reflects its worth while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still a great value for you considering the product's worth to your business, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's keep the negotiations moving forward.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $1,175,000 doesn't quite get us there. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product to your business. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement.  However, $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  How about we settle on $1,180,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to both move forward.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've negotiated Alice down significantly at this point. While we might be able to get the price a little lower, there's a risk she'll become less willing to negotiate and we'll end up closer to her initial offer or having to buy from John. Accepting at $1,180,000 secures a good price."
