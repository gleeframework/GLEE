"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions and my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget.  Let me know if you're open to accepting this.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer of $10000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10800. This is as close as I can get to your budget without sacrificing the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",10800.0,Alice,5,
