# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer of $10000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10800. This is as close as I can get to your budget without sacrificing the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, her offer is still above your $10,000 limit.  You've already made your final offer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price. It's best to secure the product from John, ensuring you get the best price within your budget."
