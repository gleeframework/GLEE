Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair deal considering its value and the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to the product's true value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? That's still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise that gives you a significant saving and allows me to achieve a profitable outcome. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but considering we only have 4 rounds left and the risk of selling to John for a much lower price, I'll accept Bob's offer. $975,000 is a good compromise and well above my minimum acceptable price."
