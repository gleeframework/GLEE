"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a significantly lower price to maximize savings, even if it means potentially walking away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair deal considering its value and the current market."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? That's still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. The offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, but there's room to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we settle on $1,000,000? It's a fair compromise that gives you a significant saving and allows me to achieve a profitable outcome. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, and $1,000,000 is tempting. However, we're within striking distance of a potentially much better deal. It's worth pushing a little further, especially with several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
