Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value,  $700,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects my desire to find a fair deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I had budgeted for this purchase.  To be honest, I'm working with a hard limit around $800,000.  If you're able to get closer to that number, I'm very interested in making this deal work. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his maximum valuation. It's time to signal that we have other options and might walk away if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the gap between our positions is substantial.  I've already made significant concessions. I'm open to a final offer, but it needs to be closer to my valuation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000.  However, I want to be transparent that I have other opportunities available if we can't reach an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer stands as a sign of my serious interest, but I do have other options if we can't find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved significantly from his initial offer and met us closer to the middle ground. While we could potentially push for a bit more, accepting $1,200,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
