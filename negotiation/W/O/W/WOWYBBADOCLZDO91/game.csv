"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit on what I can spend.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of its value,  $700,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly more than I had budgeted for this purchase.  To be honest, I'm working with a hard limit around $800,000.  If you're able to get closer to that number, I'm very interested in making this deal work. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the gap between our positions is substantial.  I've already made significant concessions. I'm open to a final offer, but it needs to be closer to my valuation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000.  However, I want to be transparent that I have other opportunities available if we can't reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I understand this product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer stands as a sign of my serious interest, but I do have other options if we can't find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
