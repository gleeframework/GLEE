"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $92? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $93. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",93.0,Alice,5,
