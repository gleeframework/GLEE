"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to meet you at $12,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
