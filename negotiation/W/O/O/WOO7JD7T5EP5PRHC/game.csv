"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm going to take a small step back from $825,000 and offer it to you for $795,000. This is my final compromise, what do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
