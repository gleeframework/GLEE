"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this product for a limited time. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, her offer of $900,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
