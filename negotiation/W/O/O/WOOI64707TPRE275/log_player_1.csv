Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.

Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win situation:

* **Bob's Profit:** Bob would make a profit of $75,000 ($1,000,000 - $925,000).
* **Your Profit:** You maximize your profit beyond your minimum, earning $125,000 ($925,000 - $800,000) 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
