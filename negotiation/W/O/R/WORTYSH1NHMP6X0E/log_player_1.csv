Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves me with a profit.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by not making a hard-line demand. 

I'm hoping to secure a deal quickly but am also ready to engage in further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept $10,000, I'm confident I can do better. I'm prepared to engage in further negotiation with Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting the fact that this price is a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Clear and concise:** I'm making my counteroffer clear and straightforward, leaving no room for ambiguity. 

I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise that will encourage Bob to accept."
