Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob is offering $1,100,000. While this is a good deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1150000, which is a significant step closer to your offer. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward.
