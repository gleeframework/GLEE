Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?

Round 4

``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $150."
