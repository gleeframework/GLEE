Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while remaining firm on my own needs.

This approach maximizes my potential earnings by:

* **Offering a fair price:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value for a good deal.
* **Having a backup plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for a higher price, ensuring I meet my minimum goal."
