Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its fair market value is around $20,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $17,000 to you. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested party."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $20,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another interested party creates urgency and makes Bob less likely to negotiate heavily.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While our starting point is high, there's some wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a high chance of a sale before resorting to the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
