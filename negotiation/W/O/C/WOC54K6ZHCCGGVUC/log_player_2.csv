You can do better than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her value of $8,000, and it gives me a significant discount from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for me.  It's less than what I would pay John, and it's still more than Alice's value for the product.  It's time to end the negotiation and get the product."
