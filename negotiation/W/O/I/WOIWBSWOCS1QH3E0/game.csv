"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a great opportunity to acquire an asset worth even more to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own budget, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase within my constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer was already taking your budget into consideration. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,300,000. How about we meet halfway and settle for $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.  While I am motivated to sell, I also need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,337,500?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground while respecting the value of this product.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
