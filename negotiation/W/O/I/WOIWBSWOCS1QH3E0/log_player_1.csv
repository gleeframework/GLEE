Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own budget, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make this purchase within my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to the value this product holds for him. We are still significantly above our minimum and can afford to push a little further."
