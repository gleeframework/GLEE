"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and reach a price closer to his target of $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob could continue to negotiate with Alice, at this point, Alice's offer is close to his maximum. It's more likely that Alice will not budge further, and Bob could risk losing the deal if he rejects this offer. It's better for him to accept this offer and save some time and effort."
