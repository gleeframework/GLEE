I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my absolute minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to accept it. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I hope this will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better offer."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating and encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
