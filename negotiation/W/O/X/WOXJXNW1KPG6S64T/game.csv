"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,750. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $9,200 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the previous offer, so I'll offer $9,375. Can you consider this price?",9375.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,500. This product is truly worth it, and I believe this price is still fair considering its value to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal at $9,500. ",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that you're not serious about selling the product at a reasonable price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll give you $9,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please consider this offer.",9250.0,Bob,6,
