(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than Alice's original price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, potentially reaching a price closer to his $80 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high for Bob. While continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and driving the price even higher exists. 

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
