"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to you. Alice is asking for $140, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is within my budget and a decent price given the value of the product. Accepting this offer will save me $15 compared to buying from John, making it the best option in this round."
