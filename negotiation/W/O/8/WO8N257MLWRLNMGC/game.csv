"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest around $1,000,000 in something like this.  Would you be open to a price closer to that range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle on $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to do $1,125,000?  That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
