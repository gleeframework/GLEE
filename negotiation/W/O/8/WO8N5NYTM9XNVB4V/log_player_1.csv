Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $1,200,000, aiming for a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're offering a price lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price gives you space to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that maximizes your profit while still being acceptable to Bob.  Keep in mind the value to John ($1,200,000) as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. Selling to John is your fallback option, and a better price is still achievable with Bob.  

**Next steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price between Bob's offer and your initial offer, perhaps $1,350,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but also that you value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 feels like a more fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $80,000 below your minimum, which is a relatively small difference. 
* **Potential for future negotiations:** While you'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and potentially leaves room for future negotiations with Bob for additional services or future products.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely, leaving you with only John's offer of $1,200,000.

**Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point, balancing a reasonable profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
