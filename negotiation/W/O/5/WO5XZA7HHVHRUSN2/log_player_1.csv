"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a deal closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest level and how serious he is about purchasing the product. His response will provide valuable information for my next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge empowers me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a higher price and am willing to engage in further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a price that more accurately reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** The proposed price of $1,650,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer and ensures a healthy profit margin above my minimum. 
* **Encourage a Counteroffer:** By suggesting a price that leaves room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to continue the discussion and potentially make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I need to stick to my budget. Let's try $1,550,000 this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Offer:** This is a strong offer considering Bob's perceived value of the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate could risk the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids potentially losing the sale to John's standing offer."
