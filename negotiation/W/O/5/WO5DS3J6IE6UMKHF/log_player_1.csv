Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is a good starting point. It's more than my minimum of $80, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not happy with it. I'm going to try and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still fair considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price,  $82 is still better than selling to John.  It's a bit disappointing, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale."
