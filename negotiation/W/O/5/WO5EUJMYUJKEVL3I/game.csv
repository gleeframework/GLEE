"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my minimum value and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1050000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This gives you a good deal, and me a reasonable price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I really think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $1025000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1025000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers at $1075000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1025000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
