Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I hope you'll consider this offer.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she's unlikely to reach my $800,000 limit. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at my desired price."
