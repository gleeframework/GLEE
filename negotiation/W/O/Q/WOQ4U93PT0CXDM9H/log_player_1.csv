Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is a better price than Bob's initial value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still not enough. I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation and sell to John for $12,000.  The risk of continuing and potentially ending up with an even lower offer is too high."
