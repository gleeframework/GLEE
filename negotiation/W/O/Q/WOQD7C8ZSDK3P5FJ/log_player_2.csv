"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $100, so there's room for negotiation."

It's still worth trying to get a lower price.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you're still closer to her bottom line than you are to John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now at $112, which is closer to your maximum price of $120.  While you could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice might get stubborn or that you'll run out of time and be forced to buy from John at $120.  It's better to accept this offer and save $8."
