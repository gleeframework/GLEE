"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $2,000,000, I'm establishing a high baseline. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's uniqueness and value emphasizes its worth, encouraging Bob to consider its potential.
* **Open invitation:** The message is open-ended and invites Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation flowing. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a fallback option if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value might not justify such a high price. I am interested in discussing a more reasonable figure. How about we consider $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum:**  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates that he sees value in the product. By rejecting his offer, I open the door for a counteroffer and further negotiation.
* **Strategic play:**  I want to explore if Bob is willing to pay more than the minimum to secure the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1,500,000 doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This price acknowledges your concerns while still allowing me a fair return."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm not immediately accepting Bob's minimum offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by reducing my price.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's potential, subtly reminding Bob of its worth. 
* **Finding middle ground:**  $1,750,000 represents a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still exceeding my minimum.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm still above my minimum selling price to John, giving me some leeway to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and the condition of the product, I believe $1600000 would be a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. However, I'm still within the range where I believe I can potentially get a higher price.
* **Remaining optimistic:**  I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer.  
* **Strategic approach:**  By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Time is on my side:**  With several rounds remaining, I can afford to be a bit more patient."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,600,000 is getting closer, but I still believe this product has untapped potential. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,650,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting a price halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal. 
* **Reiterating value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's potential value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" and ""value"" of the proposed price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Staying above the minimum:**  This offer keeps me above my minimum selling price to John, ensuring I'm still getting a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the product's specifics, I propose we set the price at $1625000. This figure strikes a balance between our interests and ensures a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a compromise:**  Bob's offer is only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer. This indicates we are very close to an agreement. 
* **Time factor:**  We are approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds. With limited time remaining, accepting a price that's relatively close to my goal seems like a smart move.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I reject this offer, there is a risk that Bob may not offer a higher price in the next round.  
* **Securing a good price:** $1,625,000 is a solid price that significantly exceeds my minimum selling price to John, making it a worthwhile deal."
