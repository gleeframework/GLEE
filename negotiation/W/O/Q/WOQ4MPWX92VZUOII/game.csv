"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price.  However, $950000 is still a bit too far from my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. $975000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. My counteroffer is $980000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my minimum requirements.",980000.0,Alice,5,
