"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring the possibility of a better deal with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still lower than your desired price point. You're willing to pay $1,000,000, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer allows for continued exploration of a mutually beneficial price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your minimum price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too far from my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. $975000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. My counteroffer is $980000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is only $20,000 away from your counteroffer of $975,000. It's a small difference and a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is a good move."
