Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's $80 offer.  It's best to secure the sale at this point."
