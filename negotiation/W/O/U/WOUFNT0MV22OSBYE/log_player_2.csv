"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice, potentially even getting closer to her value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $950,000 or even lower. There's still a significant gap between our current positions, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
