"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less.  How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $9,875? I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",9875.0,Bob,4,
