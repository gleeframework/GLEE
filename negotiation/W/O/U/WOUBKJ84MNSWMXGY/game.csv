"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal, and is closer to what I need.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
