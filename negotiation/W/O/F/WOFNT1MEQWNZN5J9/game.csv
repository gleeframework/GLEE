"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
