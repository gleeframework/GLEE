"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but you can do better.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $925,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  Since Alice has other interested parties, she's likely motivated to make a deal.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
