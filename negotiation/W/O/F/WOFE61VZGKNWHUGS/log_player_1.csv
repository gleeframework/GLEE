"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fairly high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I believe that this price is reasonable, given that I value the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above what Bob offered.  I believe this price is fair, considering my own value of the product and the potential to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum price.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal. It's a good outcome for both of us."
