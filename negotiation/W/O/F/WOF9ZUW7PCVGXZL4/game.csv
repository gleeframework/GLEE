"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value meeting in the middle, I need to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a better price, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
