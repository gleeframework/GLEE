"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $10,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $10,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm getting closer to my desired amount.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to haggle."
