"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $120 is still a bit low for me, and I have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to pay that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $125 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle at $128.  This price gives you a great value and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $122 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take the $122, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $122 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure if we can meet in the middle at $125, but I'm willing to pay $123 for the product. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's likely that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer.  $123 is still a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
