"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $130 is a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'm confident you'll find this price to be fair.",127.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $127.50 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $126. Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",126.0,Bob,4,
