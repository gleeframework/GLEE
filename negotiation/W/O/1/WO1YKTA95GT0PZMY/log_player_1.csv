"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is a good sign, showing he's seriously interested. However, there's still room for negotiation before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're getting closer, but there's still potential for a higher price from Bob before accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a number we can both agree on.  How about $950,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging our negotiation process."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $930,000. I think this is a fair price considering our negotiation so far and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is consistently meeting halfway and we're now above $900,000. Accepting at this point secures a significant profit. Further haggling risks him lowering his offer or walking away."
