"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's valuation of $1,200,000 as possible, while still getting a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still a decent profit for me.  It's also getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's a risk that further negotiations might lead to a lower offer from Bob or an even longer negotiation process.  At this point, it's wiser to accept his offer and secure a sale."
