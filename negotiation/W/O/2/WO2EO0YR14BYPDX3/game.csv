"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price, considering your desired selling point and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. It's a premium product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",11250.0,Alice,5,
