"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and call it $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. It's a bit above the middle ground, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of $1,050,000. I believe this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
