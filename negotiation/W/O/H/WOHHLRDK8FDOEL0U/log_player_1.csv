"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a good price that reflects its value without being too high. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is certainly a fair price, I believe the true value of this product is higher.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,500?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $13,500 is a good price. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that, around $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is clearly anchored around the $12,000 mark. Accepting his offer of $12,250 is a solid profit, and continuing to negotiate risks him walking away entirely."
