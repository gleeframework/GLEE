"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a high-end item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10500. This is my best price for now, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $9500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can offer it to you for $10250. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the end of the road, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $10000. This is my absolute final price, and I think it's as low as I can go.",10000.0,Alice,9,
