"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. How about $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get closer to my price.  While $92 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that.  I'm willing to drop to $98 to finalize this deal.  Let's close this out.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think I can do better. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $98, but I'd like to save a bit more.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts.  Let's be realistic, $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $96. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $96. I was thinking more along the lines of $94. I'm trying to save as much as I can, and $94 feels like a fair price for me.",94.0,Bob,8,
