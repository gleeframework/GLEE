**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has a clear path to get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice, so rejecting her offer gives Bob another chance to try and get a lower price."
