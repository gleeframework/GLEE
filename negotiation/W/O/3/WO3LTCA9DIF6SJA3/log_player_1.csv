Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a good price above my minimum.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly in the next rounds."

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm going to try to push for more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, it's a price Bob is willing to pay, while still being more than my minimum."

Bob's offer is a bit better than John's, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
