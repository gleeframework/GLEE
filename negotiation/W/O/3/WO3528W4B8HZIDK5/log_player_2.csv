"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and still gives you a decent discount from her initial offer.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might become more stubborn or walk away from the deal. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
