"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider a price closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
