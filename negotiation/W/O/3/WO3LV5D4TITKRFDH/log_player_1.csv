Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim to get at least that much from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting at your desired price might seem bold, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially settle somewhere between $8,000 (his valuation) and $10,000 (your minimum). 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of achieving the highest possible sale price."
