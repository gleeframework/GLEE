The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she is offering it for $180. This is already more than it's worth to you. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $160.  Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price from Alice."

Alice is offering the product for $140, which is still above your maximum budget of $100. Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it's the most sensible option."
