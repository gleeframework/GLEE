Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this deal with you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $87.  She knows your maximum is likely around $80 (a common negotiation tactic is to aim slightly above your true maximum).  Rather than risk the price going up or getting stuck in a stalemate, it's best to take the guaranteed $80 deal from John."
