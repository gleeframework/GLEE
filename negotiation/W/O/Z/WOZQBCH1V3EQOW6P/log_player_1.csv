Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $150 offers a decent profit margin if Bob accepts. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message suggests I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, leaving room for potential negotiation if he counters with a lower offer."
