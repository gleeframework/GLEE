# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1325000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price. He has two rounds left, but it's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,320,000. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at $1,200,000, as this guarantees him the product at his maximum budget."
