Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can we work together to find a price that works for both of us?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, considering its value and rarity.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $1100000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to be careful with my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm starting to consider buying it from John for $800000. Can you meet me at $980000 or lower?",980000.0,Bob,8,
