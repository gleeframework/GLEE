Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy balances getting a good price with keeping Bob engaged and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price, but it's very close to it. It's a good compromise to avoid further negotiations and secure a sale.  You'll be earning a decent profit and not risking losing Bob entirely."
