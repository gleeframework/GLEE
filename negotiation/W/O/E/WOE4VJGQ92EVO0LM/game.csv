"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, considering its features and benefits. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product's unique capabilities.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $900,000. I'm thinking of offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
