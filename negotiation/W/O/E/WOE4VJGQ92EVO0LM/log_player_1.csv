Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, considering its features and benefits. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
