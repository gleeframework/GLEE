Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount compared to the benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere around $1,000,000 or more.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, making Alice less desperate to accept a low offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher.
* **Relationship Importance:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive starting point might be better."
