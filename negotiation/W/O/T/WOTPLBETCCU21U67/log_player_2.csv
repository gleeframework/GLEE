"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal from Alice. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price, potentially prompting her to make a counteroffer."
