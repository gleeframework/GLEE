**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly closes the gap between his offer and John's standing offer of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
