"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
