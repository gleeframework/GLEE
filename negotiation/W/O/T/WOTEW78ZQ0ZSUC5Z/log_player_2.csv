(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to say if $900,000 is a good price.  Let's see if we can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how much wiggle room Alice has. $700,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but I still think we can get a better deal. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below Alice's current offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is continuing to come down, but I believe we can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to push closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but just slightly.  We're getting closer to Alice's offer and I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $820,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer was $700,000. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and I'll have to pay John $1,500,000. This is a solid deal for me, and I'm going to accept."
