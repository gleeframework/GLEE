"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still come away with a profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can always go to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my initial asking price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll start by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy with this outcome. This is a significant profit for me, and it's still better than selling to John for my minimum acceptable price.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that I can get a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
