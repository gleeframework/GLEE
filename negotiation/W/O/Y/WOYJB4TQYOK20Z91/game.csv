"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to consider a price that's a bit higher than $1000000, but I'd like to get a better deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of this unique product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. How about we try $1200000 again, or maybe even a bit lower?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
