{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a truly unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a substantial profit. It also emphasizes the product's value and potential, hoping to pique Bob's interest. Remember, this is just the first step in negotiation. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to consider a price that's a bit higher than $1000000, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. How about we try $1200000 again, or maybe even a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob eventually, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is willing to pay my minimum, and I'm not comfortable losing more time and potentially money. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to secure the deal."
