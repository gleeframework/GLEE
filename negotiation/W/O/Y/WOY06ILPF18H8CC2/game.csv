"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research, and I'm confident that's a fair price for this item. Would you be willing to meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal!",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $90. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
