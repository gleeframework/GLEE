"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  That would give us both a little bit of what we want.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,250 is still a bit more than I can do.  I'll offer $12,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
