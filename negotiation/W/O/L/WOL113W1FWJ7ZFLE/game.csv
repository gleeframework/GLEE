,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $110. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product would be a great value for me.  Let me know if you're open to this.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $110. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $112. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.
