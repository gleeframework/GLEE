It's way too expensive. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice first."

I'm starting with a pretty low offer, knowing Alice might counter.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice is getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to counter again."

I'm going to offer $8,500, which is closer to my budget and hopefully a reasonable compromise for Alice."

Alice is still too high. While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk it going on too long. It's time to secure the product from John at the guaranteed $8,000."
