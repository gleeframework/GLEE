"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is tempting, $12,800 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could you consider $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I can offer you a slight discount to $12,600, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12600.0,Alice,5,
