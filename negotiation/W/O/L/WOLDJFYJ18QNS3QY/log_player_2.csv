"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1100000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a lower price than the first offer, it's still not an acceptable price for Bob. It's better to keep negotiating and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value and the negotiation so far, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Although it's getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a risk to keep negotiating with Alice.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob is already five rounds into the negotiation.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $800,000."
