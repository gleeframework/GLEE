"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit shy of $110. How about $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. How about $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $115, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $112.50 for the product. That's my final offer. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer.",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already given you a lot of flexibility, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $112.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, so I'll offer you $110. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,9,
