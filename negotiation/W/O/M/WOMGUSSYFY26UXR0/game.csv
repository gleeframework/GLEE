,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, considering its potential value to me.  This offer reflects a significant compromise and represents my maximum spending limit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and similar products have commanded significantly higher prices in the market.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the market value, but $1,950,000 remains too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can both achieve.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
