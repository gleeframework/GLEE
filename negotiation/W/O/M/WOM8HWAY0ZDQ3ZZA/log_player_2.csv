"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To make this a swift deal, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is lower than Alice's offer of $1,200,000, I'd rather go with the cheaper option.
