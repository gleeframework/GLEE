Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To make this a swift deal, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong negotiating position. It makes sense to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By stating you know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to Bob, you anchor the negotiation around that figure. 
* **Premium Pricing:**  The $1,200,000 offer is a 20% premium.  While ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. If he accepts outright, you've maximized your profit.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is direct but maintains a professional and respectful tone to encourage a positive response."
