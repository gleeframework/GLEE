"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for this product, but I need to see a more significant reduction to proceed.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects a considerable compromise, and it's an opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1500000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1100000 for this product, demonstrating my genuine interest.  This offer reflects a fair price, considering the value you've outlined.  Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
