"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1100000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a more reasonable price. Can we meet in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more. How about $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1150000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1120000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1180000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1120000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1170000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",1170000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1190000. It's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $1190000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1160000. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1160000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1180000. I'm willing to make one last concession, so let's meet at $1180000. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a lot of concessions, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $1150000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",1150000.0,Bob,10,
