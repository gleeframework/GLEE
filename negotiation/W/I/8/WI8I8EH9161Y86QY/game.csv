"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1,100,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and potential. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I need, I can't accept anything below $1,040,000.  This is a final offer, as I know I can get that from other interested buyers.  Let me know what you think.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,030,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'll offer you $1,030,000 for the product, and I'm willing to consider any additional concessions you're willing to make.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
