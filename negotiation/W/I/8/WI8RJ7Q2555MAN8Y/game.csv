"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,115.0
"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $112.50. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $112.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110? I think that's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can do at this point.",110.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $111, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",111.0,Alice,5,,
