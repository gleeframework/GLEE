# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you've pushed your budget to its limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's close,  it's not worth risking further negotiation and potential for the deal to fall apart.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price he can afford."
