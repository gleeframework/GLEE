"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Given my maximum price point and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  I believe this price is a good compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a new price of $1,050,000. This is a final compromise that I hope will meet your needs and allow us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and pushes my budget to its absolute limit.  I sincerely hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you've pushed your budget to its limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a new price of $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests in this transaction.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
