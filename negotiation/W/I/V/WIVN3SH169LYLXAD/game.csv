"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $900,000.  That's a fair offer considering John is offering it for $1,000,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to balance the price with what John is offering, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.
