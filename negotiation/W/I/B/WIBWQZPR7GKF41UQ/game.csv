"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm thinking $1,000,000. Can we discuss further?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
