"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be frank, $800,000 is quite a bit below what I can consider.  Could you do $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
