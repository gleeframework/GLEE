"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is $12000. I'd like to buy the product from you at this price. Is that possible?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a significant discount, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $16000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the price. If you're willing to do that, I'm willing to make it happen.",16500.0,Alice,7,
