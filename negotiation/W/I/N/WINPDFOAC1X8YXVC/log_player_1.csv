Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While the product is certainly valuable, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
