"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the original owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,500 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
