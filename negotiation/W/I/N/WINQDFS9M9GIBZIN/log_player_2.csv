"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the original owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. She seems unlikely to budge much further, and John offers a guaranteed price that's better than her current offer."
