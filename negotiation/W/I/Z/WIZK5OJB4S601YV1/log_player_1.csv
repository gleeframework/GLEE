Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential. However, I believe  $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
