"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm sure you'll get a lot of value out of it.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
