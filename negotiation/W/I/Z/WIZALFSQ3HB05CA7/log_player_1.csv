Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message helps build rapport and might make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By offering a price lower than my minimum, I create space for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Prepared to sell to John:** If Bob rejects, I have a backup buyer in John who will pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer to my minimum, $90 is still below my target.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Potential for a win-win:**  By staying in the negotiation, I can explore a price that's more favorable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my lowest price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not losing money.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly to maintain a good relationship with Bob. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I can still make a final counteroffer before selling to John."
