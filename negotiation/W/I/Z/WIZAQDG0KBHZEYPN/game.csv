"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This still offers a good profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this moment.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
