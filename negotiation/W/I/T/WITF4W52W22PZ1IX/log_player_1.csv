"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, as this gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also trying to be friendly and build rapport with Bob.  We'll see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a great price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to agree.  Hopefully, we can close this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me some negotiating leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm trying to be flexible here, but $110 is just not going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'm staying positive and emphasizing the fairness of the price, hoping to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now at round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $150. While I would love to make a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John for $150 rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to take John's offer and move on."
