Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $12,000, so you're leaving room for negotiation while still making a profit. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while also leaving yourself room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'd be willing to sell it to you for $9,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price of $9,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  This price is still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, making it potentially attractive to him. It's also closer to my minimum value of $12,000, ensuring I don't sell it for too low a price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing the value Bob would be getting for the product. It also leaves the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to sell the product to John for $12,000, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000.  Accepting his offer allows me to make a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to an even lower price.  Additionally, it's a good compromise, and  a ""fair price"" as Bob mentioned, which  should lead to a positive outcome for both of us."
