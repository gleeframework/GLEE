Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also being mindful of my own budget.

Round 4

While we're still above John's offer, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Accepting $1,262,500 is a good outcome and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
