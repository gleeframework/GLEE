"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but you can do better.
* You know you can buy the product from John for $120.  
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with her or potentially find another seller who might be willing to offer a lower price."
