"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. To make this a swift deal, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget, the value this product brings is considerably higher. I could meet you halfway â€“ how about $17,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 makes the most sense at this point. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and further negotiation risks losing him altogether."
