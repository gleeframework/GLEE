"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to consider $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
