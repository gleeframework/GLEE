Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is higher than what Bob values the product at, it's still within a reasonable range.  People sometimes pay a premium if they perceive something as valuable or if it's something they really want. 
* **Safety Net:**  The most important factor is that you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This means you don't have to settle for anything less than that.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always come down in price slightly, but remember your bottom line is $150."
