"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counter-offers, and I can potentially get a higher price.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message, hoping to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $110, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  I have 8 rounds left, and John is a viable option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I can offer you the product for $115.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $115, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you meet me at $112? I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $112 is getting closer to my desired price, I still have a few rounds left and I'm hoping to get to $115.  I also want to see if Bob will budge any further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and meet at $113? I'm confident you'll be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 113}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. How about we meet at $111? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get the product at a good price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, I'm only 1 round away from selling to John for $120, and I'm not sure if I can convince Bob to go any higher.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal."
