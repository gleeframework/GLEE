Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $13,500 for the product. This price reflects the value it brings to your business while remaining within your budget. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm happy to meet you at $13,250.  This would make the deal work for me, and hopefully, it's a number that works for you as well."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to sell the product for $13,375. This price reflects the value of the product while also accommodating your budget. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,375 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $13,250.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  Since Bob's goal is to save money and the offer is very close to his target, accepting the deal is the most logical choice.  It's important to note that Bob could still potentially lose money on this deal, as he's paying more than the product is worth to him ($12,000), but it's the best possible outcome given the circumstances."
