"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I'm still a bit above $14,000. I'll meet you at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal at this price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
