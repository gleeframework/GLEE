"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 or less. Would it be possible for you to adjust the price accordingly?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the product, I must respectfully decline at $1200000. Given my requirements, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price closer to $800000. Would you be open to discussing further?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
