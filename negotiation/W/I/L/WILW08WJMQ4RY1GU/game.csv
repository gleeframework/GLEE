"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's significant potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while reflecting a price point that works for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is still a significant gap from what I consider a fair price. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, anything above $900,000 is pushing my budget, but I do value this product. If you're willing to meet me at $900,000, we have a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
