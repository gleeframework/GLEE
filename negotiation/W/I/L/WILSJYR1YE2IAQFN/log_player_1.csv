"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's value to allow for some back and forth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **My minimum:** I'm aware that my minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, so I won't accept anything lower.
* **John as backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob becomes unreasonable. 
* **Ten rounds:**  I have time to negotiate, so I'm not pressured to accept the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, I'm not ready to give up yet. I believe there's still potential for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John as a safety net:** I know I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I have the flexibility to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, to make him more receptive to a higher price.
* **Collaborative tone:** I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to foster a cooperative spirit.

**Important Notes:**

* I'm staying firm on my minimum price, but also leaving room for Bob to potentially meet me halfway.
*  The ten rounds allow me to be patient and not rush into a bad deal.
* I'm always aware of John as a backup option, which gives me confidence in my negotiations."
