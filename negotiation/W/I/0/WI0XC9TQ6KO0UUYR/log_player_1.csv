Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired price of $100, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100 if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  How about $95? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is closer to Bob's offer and still above my minimum. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob, bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  How about $90? I think that's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. Considering that I can sell the product to John for $100, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and avoid any further negotiation."
