"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and gives you room for negotiation. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,550,000? This price is still fair considering the product's benefits for you, and it allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,400,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your effort. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you almost halfway again, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000. Let's settle on $1,475,000. This represents a significant compromise from my side and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
