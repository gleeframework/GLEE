Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob a clear incentive to negotiate. However, it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation and potentially a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially wanted, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also significantly higher than John's offer, so accepting this deal is the best option to maximize my profit."
