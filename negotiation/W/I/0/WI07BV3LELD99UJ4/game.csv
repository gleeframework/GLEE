"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to see some movement on your end. Would you consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could potentially do $1,250,000. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  To meet you halfway, I could consider $1,625,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,625,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,350,000? That's a fair compromise, in my opinion.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, we're nearly there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,450,000?  This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to close this deal. ",1450000.0,Alice,7,
