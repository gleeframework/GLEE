"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good value for the product, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
