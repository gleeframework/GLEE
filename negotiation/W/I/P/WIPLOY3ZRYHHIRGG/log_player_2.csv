"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John, you might as well buy from John. You are trying to save money, and there's no benefit to buying from Alice in this scenario."
