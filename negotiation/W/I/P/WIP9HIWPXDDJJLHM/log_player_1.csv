Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, a price of $14,000 offers him a $1,000 savings, making it a tempting proposition. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John. This knowledge empowers you to start higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate."
