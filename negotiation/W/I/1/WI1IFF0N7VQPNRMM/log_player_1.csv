Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering a ""great deal"" for Bob, implying he's getting a good price, while also mentioning it's a ""fair price"" for me. This aims to make him feel good about the offer without giving away my true minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves me room to potentially negotiate down to $10,000 or even $9,000 if needed. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup. If Bob rejects the offer or counteroffers at a price I'm not happy with, I can always sell to John for my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I cannot accept that offer and still achieve my financial goals. While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's counteroffer is simply too low. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, giving him a chance to come up to a more reasonable price. However, I'm ready to sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable with his offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm lowering my offer from $12,000 to $9,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Reinforce the value:**  I emphasize that $9,000 is still a ""great deal"" for Bob.
* **Highlight the need:**  I state that this price is ""closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile,"" implying there's a limit to how much I can lower the price. 
* **Keeping options open:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for a significant loss, even with the possibility of further negotiation. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer again. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if this counteroffer isn't successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Would you consider $8,500? This would allow us to both reach a fair agreement. "", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing $8,500, the midpoint between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair agreement"" for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation.
* **Closing the gap:** I'm reducing the gap between our offers, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Still prepared for John:**  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to move on to John and secure my desired $15,000."
