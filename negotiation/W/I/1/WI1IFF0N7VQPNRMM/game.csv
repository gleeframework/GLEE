,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Would you consider $8,500? This would allow us to both reach a fair agreement. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
