"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as I might be able to get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $22,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum offer is $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway? I can let it go for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my price.  Buying from John is still a viable option if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  However, $10,000 is still less than I'm looking for.  I'm willing to accept $13,000, which is a compromise on my end.  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my budget, and she's indicated it's her final offer.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that we won't reach a deal.  To avoid the risk of losing the opportunity, I'll buy the product from John for $8,000. It's the best option for me at this point."
