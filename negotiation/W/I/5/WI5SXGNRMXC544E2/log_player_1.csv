Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to be flexible, I still believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it's getting close to the deadline. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $1,100,000 is still a good deal for me. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for a lower price."
