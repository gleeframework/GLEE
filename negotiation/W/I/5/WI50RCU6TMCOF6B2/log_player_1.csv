Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your movement.  To be completely transparent, I have a backup option at a lower price.  However, I'd prefer to make a deal with you.  Would you consider a final offer of $780,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has explicitly revealed he has a backup option but prefers to close a deal. This suggests he's nearing his maximum budget. While time is a factor, we still have a few rounds to potentially push for a better offer."
