"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it incredibly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John for $150."
