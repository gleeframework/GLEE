"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $135 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. How about $130?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is getting closer to your budget, it's still slightly above your maximum limit of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get it down to your target price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is a good strategy."
