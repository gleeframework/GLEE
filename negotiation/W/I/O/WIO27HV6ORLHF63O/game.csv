"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to go up to $120.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a compromise from my original price.",155.0,Alice,5,
