Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $19,000."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I'm aiming high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  Starting at $19,000 gives me significant room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification of value:**  While I don't want to reveal the minimum I'll accept, I hint at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer isn't a ""take it or leave it"" proposition.  It opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
