""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $12,000 if Bob declines. This knowledge allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob."
