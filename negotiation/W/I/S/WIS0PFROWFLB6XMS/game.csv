"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $1,200,000 is quite a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range. I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is closer to my original target, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
