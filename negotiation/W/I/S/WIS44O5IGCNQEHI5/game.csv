"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $11500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
