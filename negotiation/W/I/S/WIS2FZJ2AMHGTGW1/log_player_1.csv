Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or a quick win if Bob accepts the initial offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth to you, you're subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind, even if he doesn't value it at quite the same price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
