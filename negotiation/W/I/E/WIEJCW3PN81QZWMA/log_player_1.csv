"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before deciding whether to lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could sell to John for $100, I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $120.  This is still a reasonable price considering my minimum acceptable price of $100, and hopefully, it's a compromise that Bob will be more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and counter in the next round. I'm hoping to get at least $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is my final compromise as it's only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has shown he's not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. While $95 is better than $80, it's still not worth risking further rounds. It's time to take the safe bet and sell to John for $100."
