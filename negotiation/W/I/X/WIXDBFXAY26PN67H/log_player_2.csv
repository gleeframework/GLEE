"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and developed, and I'm confident it could significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to secure a valuable asset at a competitive rate while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial partnership. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, but it's still more than what Alice considers the product to be worth ($800,000).
* **John's offer is $1,000,000.**  While this is the most expensive option, it's still within your budget.

**Strategy:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer. You can still acquire the product from John, albeit at a higher price, but this will still result in a net savings compared to accepting Alice's offer."
