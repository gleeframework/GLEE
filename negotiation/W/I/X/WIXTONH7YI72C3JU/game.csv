"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows for a good profit margin for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're firm on your price, but $950,000 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we compromise at $975,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
