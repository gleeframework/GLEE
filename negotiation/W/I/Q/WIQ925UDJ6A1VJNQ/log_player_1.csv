Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but leaving some room for Bob to counter-offer allows for a potentially higher sale price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, $9,500 is still significantly more than the $8,000 John is willing to pay.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing the best possible outcome for Alice."
