Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but offering the product at that price would likely lead to Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and Alice can still make a profit even if she comes down slightly.
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
