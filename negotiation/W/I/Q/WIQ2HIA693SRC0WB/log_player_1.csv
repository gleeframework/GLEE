Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
