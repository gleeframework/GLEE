"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'll get. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to respond with a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential gains:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoid quick rejection:**  Starting too low could lead to a quick rejection and the need to make significant concessions. 
* **Encourage counteroffers:**  By being open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to engage and hopefully arrive at a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest and indicated a willingness to pay more than his initial perceived value. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John at this stage would guarantee a sale, but it would also leave money on the table. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try to get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stand:**  I'll reiterate my minimum value while being open to reasonable compromises.
* **Time as an Asset:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I gain time and more opportunities to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $950,000.

* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the ""true value"" of the product to justify my price. 
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I use a positive tone (""Let's keep talking"") to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  I'm aiming for a gradual increase in price, hoping to secure a better deal than Bob's initial offer without completely alienating him.
* **Setting Boundaries:**  My counteroffer is a clear indication of my minimum acceptable price point.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This round allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm prepared to come down to $975,000.
