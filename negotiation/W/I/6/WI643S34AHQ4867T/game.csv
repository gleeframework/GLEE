"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10500 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11250 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Would you be open to $10750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your effort to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10750 is still a little too low for me.  How about $11000?  That's a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to finalize the sale. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
