Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground here. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who values this product at a price closer to my initial asking price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm afraid that's as low as I can go. This offer stands for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using classic negotiation tactics, introducing another interested buyer to create urgency.  However, her price is still far above your maximum budget.  It's time to signal that you're serious about your budget and willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  However, my budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $750,000.  If that's not workable for you, I understand, and I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but respectful:** This counteroffer reiterates your budget constraint while acknowledging Alice's position.
* **Final offer (almost):** By stating your firm budget, you're sending a strong signal that this is your best offer, and you're prepared to walk away.
* **Leaving the door open:**  While firm, you leave a small window for Alice to reconsider if she's truly desperate to sell.  It's unlikely she'll accept $750,000 immediately, but it sets up the next round for a potential deal."
