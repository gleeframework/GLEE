"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective. It's clear we both see value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To move this forward, I'd propose  $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground here. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer who values this product at a price closer to my initial asking price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to own this. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm afraid that's as low as I can go. This offer stands for a limited time.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  However, my budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $750,000.  If that's not workable for you, I understand, and I'll have to consider other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
