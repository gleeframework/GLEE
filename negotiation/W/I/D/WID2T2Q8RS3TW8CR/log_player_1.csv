Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $125. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to make a profit and hopefully gets Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I've already made a significant concession. At this point, it's better to sell to John and get a guaranteed $100. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result."
