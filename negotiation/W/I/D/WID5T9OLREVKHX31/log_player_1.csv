"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate if needed.  I'm also being positive and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go down to $15,000 right now. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm still trying to get a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept or come closer to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $15,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it seems Bob is firm on his price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it's not worth risking further negotiation rounds when John is already willing to pay my minimum."
