"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. Let's make this happen!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
