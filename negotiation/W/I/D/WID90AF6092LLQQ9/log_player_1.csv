"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still leaves a decent profit for me. I'll see how he responds before deciding whether to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $175 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering at $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I'm willing to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $180. While I'd prefer more, it's getting close to my minimum.  With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal and settling for John's $150 offer."
