Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature of the product to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might outright reject this high price, but it gives you room to work down towards your minimum while still aiming for the highest possible profit."
