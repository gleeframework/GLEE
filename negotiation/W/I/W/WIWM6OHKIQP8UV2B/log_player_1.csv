Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it's of great value and would benefit you greatly."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $120. Setting the price at $100 gives you the maximum possible profit ($20) while still making it highly likely Bob will accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer aims to secure the deal quickly, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he wants, potentially increasing your profit slightly. 
* **Avoiding the Risk of John:** Offering it at a price too close to your minimum ($80) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. This would force you to sell to John and miss out on potential profit."
