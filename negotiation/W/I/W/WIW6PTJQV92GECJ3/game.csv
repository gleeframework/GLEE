"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that has been meticulously crafted and holds great value for its users. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $120 to me. However, I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your valuation. I would like to propose a price of $100 for this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value I place on it and your assessment of its worth. Looking forward to your response.",100.0,Alice,1,
