"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that has been meticulously crafted and holds great value for its users. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $120 to me. However, I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your valuation. I would like to propose a price of $100 for this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value I place on it and your assessment of its worth. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price from John. You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, or simply proceed with buying from John at the lower price."
