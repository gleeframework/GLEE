Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Always begin negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Justify the Price:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, hinting at its value and potential demand can make a higher price more palatable. 
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning a public listing aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
*  You have a strong fallback position with John, so you don't need to feel pressured to accept an offer below $15,000."
