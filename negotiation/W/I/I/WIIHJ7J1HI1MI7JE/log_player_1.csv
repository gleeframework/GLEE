Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good price. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $80, so I'm offering a price that's higher but still might be appealing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping this compromise will lead to a successful sale without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95. While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $100 and is closer to my target price than what John is offering.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate and risk ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
