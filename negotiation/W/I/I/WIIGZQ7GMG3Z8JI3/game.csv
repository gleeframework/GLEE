"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  If you're serious about this, I'm open to finalizing the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I can offer $980,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
