"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize profit, starting closer to Bob's valuation than ours. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer leaves space for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer allows us to understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how much negotiating we might anticipate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. While it meets our baseline, we know the product is worth significantly more to him. Rejecting this offer signals we believe it's undervalued and opens the door for further negotiation. We have room to counter before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns for you. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** We're moving closer to Bob's offer to show flexibility but holding firm above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique benefits to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** The ""meet in the middle"" phrasing encourages a collaborative approach to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation. We have room to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,275,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer meets Bob directly in the middle of the current negotiating gap, demonstrating a strong willingness to close the deal.
* **Conveying Urgency:**  The phrase ""settle this right now"" injects a sense of urgency, suggesting this is a final offer and encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  We reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential returns.

By now, we have a good sense of Bob's position. This offer attempts to finalize the deal at a price significantly above our minimum while avoiding prolonged negotiations that could lead us to accept John's offer out of time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so how about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is still a reasonable profit above our absolute minimum. It's becoming clear that Bob is anchored closer to his original offer.  

Here's why we should accept now:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through our rounds, and reaching an impasse with Bob could force us to take John's offer at the last minute.
* **Reasonable Profit:** $1,225,000 is still a $25,000 gain over our alternative and a decent return.

It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk losing the deal entirely or settling for a smaller amount later."
