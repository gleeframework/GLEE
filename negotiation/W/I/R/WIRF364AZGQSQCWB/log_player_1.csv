Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a strong opening offer,  as it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. This strategy aims to quickly establish a high starting point, leaving more potential for gain if Bob accepts. If he rejects, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the value I believe the product holds.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a bit higher than John's, it's still too far below my desired price. I will continue negotiating with Bob to try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and my desired price point. This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to secure a better price.  At this point, it's more efficient to accept John's offer and move on. There's no guarantee that continuing to negotiate with Bob will result in a higher price, and the risk of him walking away entirely is too high."
