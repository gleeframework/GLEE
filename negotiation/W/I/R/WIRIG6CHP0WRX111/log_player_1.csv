Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit for me, well above my minimum.  It's also a compelling offer for Bob, saving him $100,000 compared to its perceived value to him.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
