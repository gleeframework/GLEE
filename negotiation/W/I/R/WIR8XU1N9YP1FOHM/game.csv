"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value you're highlighting, $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the unique value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9500 is closer, but it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $8500.  I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer you $9250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
