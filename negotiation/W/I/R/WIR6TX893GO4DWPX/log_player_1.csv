"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also setting a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I can't afford such a price. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the significant value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I still have some room to negotiate.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a solid option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting closer to a deal, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I still believe I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us, and I want to see if we can bridge this gap. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal closer to my desired price."
