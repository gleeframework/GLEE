Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below its worth.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant move from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're willing to counter to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some more movement on your end as well. Would you consider $1,210,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1210000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're moving in smaller increments now to signal that we're getting closer to our bottom line. This offer is still significantly above John's offer, while hopefully being tempting enough for Bob to seriously consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I could do $1,190,000.  That's a pretty fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly motivated and getting close to our acceptable range. While we could push for a bit more, accepting at $1,190,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or negotiations stalling out.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer."
