Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving me significant room for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to maximize my profit, so offering it for a price closer to his valuation than mine makes sense.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While my ideal price is close to $925,000, starting with this offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price that is still highly profitable for me.
* **The John Factor:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be completely without a buyer. This knowledge empowers me to aim higher with Bob."
