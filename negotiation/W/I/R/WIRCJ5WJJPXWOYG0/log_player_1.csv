Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $12,000 for the product, or I'm better off selling to John.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, but significantly higher than Bob's maximum. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a decent profit. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently sell to John for my minimum price. If he accepts, I'll still make a good profit."
