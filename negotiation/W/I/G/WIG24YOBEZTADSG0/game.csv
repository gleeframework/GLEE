"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  How about we make this the final offer - $10,750, and we have a deal?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I respect that.  But I need to be realistic about my budget. $11,000 is my absolute limit.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think it's a stretch for me to go any lower. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,9,
