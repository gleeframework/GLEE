"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it that way.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
