Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value to you, I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, $900,000 is too low, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him.  I have time to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it that way."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,050,000 is a good price, especially considering the time we have left in the negotiation.  While I could potentially get a bit more, I'm happy with this deal and don't want to risk losing the sale."
