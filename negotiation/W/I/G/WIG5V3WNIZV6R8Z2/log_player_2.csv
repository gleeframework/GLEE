"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, so I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start negotiations, I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  This is a substantial starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than what I'm ultimately willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price. $600,000 is still a significant amount, so it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but it also leaves a decent amount of room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,000,000, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  There's still room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still too high for me.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both understand the product holds."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm still leaving room for negotiation, keeping in mind my maximum budget of $800,000. This counteroffer reflects a more balanced position, hopefully leading to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $825,000? This reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Even though we are getting closer, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a lower price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to my budget with just a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable range.  To finalize the deal, I'm offering $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product given our discussions.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for my absolute maximum price,  showing Alice I'm committed to finalizing the deal.  This offer leaves no room for further negotiation, encouraging Alice to accept and close the deal in this round."
