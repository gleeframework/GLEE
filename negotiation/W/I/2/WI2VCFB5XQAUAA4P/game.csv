"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $8000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. It's still worth $12000 to me, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
