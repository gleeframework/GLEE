"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $650,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $800,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
