Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $20,000 sets a high starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Showing flexibility:** By stating I'm ""open to negotiating"", I signal that I'm willing to work with Bob. This encourages him to make a counteroffer rather than immediately rejecting the deal.
* **Leaving room for John:**  My minimum acceptable price is $15,000, so there's a $5,000 buffer before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, so accepting it ensures I get at least what the product is worth to me.
* **No need for further negotiation:** There's no room for improvement on my end, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, accepting Bob's offer ensures the sale happens now, saving me time and effort."
