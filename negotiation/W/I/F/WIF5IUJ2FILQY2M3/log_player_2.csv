"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you ($10,000).  By rejecting, you can still get the product from John for your maximum price."
