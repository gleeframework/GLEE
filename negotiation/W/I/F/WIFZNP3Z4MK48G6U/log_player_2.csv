{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's well above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the opportunity cost of buying from another seller."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and its potential impact on your business, I am willing to negotiate at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I will reject the offer and continue negotiating.  I can still get the product from John for $1,000,000, so I have no reason to rush into this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After careful consideration, Bob, I am willing to accept a price of $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise given the value it holds for your business and the competitive market conditions. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  While it's getting closer to my budget, I'm still within my acceptable range with John's offer. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain something from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests and the value the product brings to your business.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price.  While we're getting closer,  I'm starting to run out of rounds and I'm concerned that Alice might not be willing to come down much further. I'd rather secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
