"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both, as it's still significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,600,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from the transaction. If you're not comfortable with this offer, I'll need to go with another seller.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $1,550,000, which is a good middle ground between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
