"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it at $95. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $95 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you prompt her to potentially lower the price in a counter-offer. If her price doesn't come down enough, you still have the option to buy from John for $100."
