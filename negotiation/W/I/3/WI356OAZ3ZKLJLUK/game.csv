"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the ballpark of  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is very close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,7,
