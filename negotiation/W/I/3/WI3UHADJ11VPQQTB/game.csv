"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your interest. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle for $10,125? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $9,900.  This is a fair offer considering your last reduction was less than half of mine.  What do you think?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,7,
