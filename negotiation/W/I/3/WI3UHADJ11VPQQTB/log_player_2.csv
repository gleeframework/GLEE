Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.

Alice is clearly trying to push the price as high as possible, but she's made a significant concession coming down to $10,000.  You're unlikely to get a much better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing her away. Accepting at $10,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at the higher price."
