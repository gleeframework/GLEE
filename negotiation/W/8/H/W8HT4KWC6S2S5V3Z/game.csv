"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I have to say that I'm still quite attached to my initial offer of $1,400,000. Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.
