Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's value of $12,000, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close enough to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves some room for profit.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but it also reflects that I still believe the product is worth more."
