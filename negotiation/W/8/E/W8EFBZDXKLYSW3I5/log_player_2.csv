"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept an offer that's higher than that. You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $10,000, knowing it's likely Alice will reject it. This sets the stage for a negotiation. Since Alice values the product at $10,000, it's a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is closer to my desired price.  However, I still want to try to get a better deal.  I have multiple rounds left and can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000. This is a compromise between Alice's last offer and my previous offer. It shows good faith and signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I still have time and rounds to negotiate.  I believe we can reach a deal closer to $11,000, which would still be a significant savings compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $11,100. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway. I believe Alice is likely to accept this offer, as it's closer to her last offer and she's probably getting impatient to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and we're very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, we're only on Round 7 and I don't want to risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  Accepting her offer now secures the purchase and saves me a significant amount compared to John."
