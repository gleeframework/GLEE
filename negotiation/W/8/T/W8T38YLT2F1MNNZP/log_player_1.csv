Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would still allow you a profit while being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
