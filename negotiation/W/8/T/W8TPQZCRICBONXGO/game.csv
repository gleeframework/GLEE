"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it!",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $10500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9750 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your desired selling price and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $9200. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's value and your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9200 is closer, I'm still not able to go above my $8500 limit.  I think this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price in this round.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting close to considering other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
