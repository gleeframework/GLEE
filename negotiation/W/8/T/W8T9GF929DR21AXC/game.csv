"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $1,025,000.  How about $1,040,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,030,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
