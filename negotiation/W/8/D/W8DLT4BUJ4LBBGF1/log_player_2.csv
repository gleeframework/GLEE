"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $12,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $12,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still being a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This demonstrates that he's willing to compromise but still wants to get a good deal. He's hoping that Alice will be more willing to negotiate now that she's seen that Bob is serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has lowered the price to $10,800, it is still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

Bob is increasing his offer again to $9,800. He's getting closer to Alice's price, but still trying to get a good deal. He believes this might be a good compromise point, as Alice has been lowering her price and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still offering a price that is higher than Bob's target.  While he could continue negotiating, it's unclear if he can get a price that's good enough.  At this point, it's better for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets a price within his budget."
