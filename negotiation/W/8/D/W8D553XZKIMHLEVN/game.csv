"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $8500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $9000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to offer you $9500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in making this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,6,
