"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice.  However, $9000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $8500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking $9200 is a fair price for the product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $8750.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'll take the product off your hands.",8750.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8750, but I'm willing to go to $9000 to make this happen. Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go up to $9000, Bob. I think we've been close enough already. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,9,
