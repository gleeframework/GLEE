"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to say that $120 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $130. How about we try $132? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $132. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $131?",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $131. How about we try $133? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",133.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again?",130.0,Bob,8,
