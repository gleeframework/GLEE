"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know you've been interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a significant discount for you, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
