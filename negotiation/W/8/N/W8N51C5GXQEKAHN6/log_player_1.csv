"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know you've been interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is above my minimum of $800,000, it's significantly below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000) and my initial offer ($1,200,000). I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation, especially given Bob's expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a significant discount for you, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I am proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still quite a bit below the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000).  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can achieve a higher price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your proposal, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is very close to my last counteroffer. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to secure a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
