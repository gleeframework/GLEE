"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering $1,050,000. Let's find some common ground and make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $1,025,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's a good compromise.  It's also important to consider that John might not be available or might change his mind later.  It's better to close the deal with Bob now and secure the sale."
