Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting higher ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization for Alice.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""immense value and potential"" aims to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards the potential returns rather than just the initial cost.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob. This strong alternative allows for a bolder initial offer."
