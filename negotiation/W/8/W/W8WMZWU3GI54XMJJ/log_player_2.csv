"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,500. This is a special opportunity considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to go that low?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to what you're looking for. How about $14,000 for the product? I believe this strikes a balance between the value the product holds for you and my goal of maximizing the sale price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price of $13,500, and it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 I'd pay from John.  It's in my best interest to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
