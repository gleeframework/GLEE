Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $19,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even though I understand it's a significant investment. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation and your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message uses positive language, highlighting the product's value and acknowledging the price while encouraging a response.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer ($15,000) if Bob rejects your initial offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob, you could adjust the price. However, starting high gives you the flexibility to negotiate down if needed."
