"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer ($60) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. My goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This low offer gives me plenty of room to increase my bid gradually in subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to buy from John for $80, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too high for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $110 is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than my $80 limit and considerably higher than my initial offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there's room for further negotiation.  I need to signal that I'm looking for a much lower price point. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have the option to buy from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't move in a favorable direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $70, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her current offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests how much further Alice is willing to come down on price. 
* **Staying Below Limit:**  I'm still well below my $80 limit, ensuring I have room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $90 is a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's within my $80 limit.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that this is her final offer, so there's likely little room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding John:** While I could buy from John for $80, accepting Alice's offer saves me the hassle of going to another seller. 

Overall, $90 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to pay a slightly higher price to secure the product now."
