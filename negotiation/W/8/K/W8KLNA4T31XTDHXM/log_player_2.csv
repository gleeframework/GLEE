"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below his maximum, he can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to his desired $1,200,000 price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?
