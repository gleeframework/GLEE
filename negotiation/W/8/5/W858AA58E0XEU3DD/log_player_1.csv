Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This considers both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Cutting negotiations short ensures I get a guaranteed good deal."
