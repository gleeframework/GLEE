Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I want to finalize the deal, $9000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's make it happen.
