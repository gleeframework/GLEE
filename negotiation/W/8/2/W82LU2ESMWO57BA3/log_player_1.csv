"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I know it's worth more than that to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and gives you a great deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I have more rounds to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $12,000. I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I want to finalize the deal, $9,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to go up to $9050, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  $9,050 is closer to my minimum but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to see if I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,050 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,150.  Let's make a deal and close this out.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has repeatedly refused to budge above $9,050. We are now in round 8, with only two rounds left. I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob at this point. It's better to sell to John now for $12,000 and guarantee my minimum desired price."
