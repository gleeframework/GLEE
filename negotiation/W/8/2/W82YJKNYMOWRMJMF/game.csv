"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $650,000 for the product.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $750,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is tempting, I'm only comfortable going down to $725,000.  This offer is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to bump up my offer slightly, how about $710,000?  That's a firm offer from my side.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $715,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",715000.0,Alice,7,
