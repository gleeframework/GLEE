# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the value is significant.  Let's see if we can strike a deal!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $650,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're still quite a bit away from my target price. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $750,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $700,000 is tempting, I'm only comfortable going down to $725,000.  This offer is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to bump up my offer slightly, how about $710,000?  That's a firm offer from my side."",
 ""product_price"": 710000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $715,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to my target price and getting closer to John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down much further, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk losing the opportunity."
