"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You have a lot of room to negotiate down to a price closer to your desired range. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money. 
* Buying from John immediately would be a worse deal than negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $912,500 is still above your desired range, but it's getting closer.
* It's possible to keep negotiating, but you risk Alice walking away or needing to buy from John, which is far more expensive.
* This offer represents a significant savings compared to buying from John, making it a reasonable compromise."
