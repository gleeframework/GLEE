Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly, but I want to see if I can get him to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a price that's halfway between my minimum and his offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get $100,  Bob's offer of $95 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and selling to John would net me the same amount.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
