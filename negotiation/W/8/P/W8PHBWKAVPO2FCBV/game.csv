"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I appreciate your understanding.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $750,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000, which I believe is fair given its unique capabilities and potential for your business.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
