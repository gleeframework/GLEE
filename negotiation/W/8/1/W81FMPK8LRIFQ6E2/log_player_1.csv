Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
