"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $650,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for $650,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  How about $675,000?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
