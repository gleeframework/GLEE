"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to explore a lower price.  It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $650,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for $650,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. Buying from John at this point is not the best option, as there's a chance to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  How about $675,000?  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and there's a good chance she won't budge further.  Accepting the offer at $725,000 saves Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John. There's a risk of getting a lower price by continuing to negotiate, but the likelihood of success is low.  It's better to secure the deal and save the money at this point."
