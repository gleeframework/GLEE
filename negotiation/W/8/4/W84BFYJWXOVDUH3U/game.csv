,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a little hesitant at $105. How about we settle on $98?  It's a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the profit margin. How about we meet at $105 is too high, but $99 is a bit low. Let's try $102?",102.0,Alice,7,
