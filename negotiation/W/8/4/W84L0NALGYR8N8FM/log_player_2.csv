"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable number as we discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a very high initial offer from Alice.  As Bob, it's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's worth exploring if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for some negotiation. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is a starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth exploring if she's willing to come down further.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
