"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable number as we discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows you to gain more than anticipated.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,600,000, I am signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the product's worth in Bob's mind at a higher level. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language emphasizes finding a ""mutually agreeable number"" to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for some negotiation.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm better off negotiating further and seeing if I can get closer to my target. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is a starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential this product holds. To move things forward, I propose a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Counteroffer:** Showing respect for Bob's offer encourages a collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** While still above my minimum and Bob's offer, the $150,000 decrease from my initial offer signals willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the higher price.
* **Framing as ""Fair Compromise"":** This positions my counteroffer as a balanced solution beneficial to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend right now. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving us both a good deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob walks away or stalls. Accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at my minimum."
