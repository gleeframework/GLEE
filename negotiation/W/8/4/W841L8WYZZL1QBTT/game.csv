"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
