Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives Bob a good deal as it's only $20 more than what it's worth to him. It also gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's only $5 more than what it's worth to him. It also gets me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $100.  While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk going back and forth for too long.  It's better to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed $100."
