"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $170 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? ",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's make it happen!",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I really want to make this work.  How about we settle at $135?  That's a good compromise and a great deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there!  $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $132.50? That way we both get a good deal.",132.5,Bob,8,
