"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the introduction. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is unrealistic for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the inherent value and the substantial returns you'll see.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product represents a significant investment, but your current offer still doesn't align with my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  To be completely transparent, walking away with anything under $1,500,000 would mean accepting a significant loss on my end. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower offer, but it needs to be closer to that mark.  How about we try $1,650,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution while acknowledging the true value of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm also being upfront â€“ anything over $800,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  I understand this is a significant reduction from your initial ask, but I believe it's a fair deal considering my financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
