"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's worth to you. It's highly unlikely accepting this offer would be a good deal. You know you have a backup option with John, so it's worth negotiating with Alice for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the introduction. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is unrealistic for me. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $600,000."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a much lower offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Establishes a baseline:**  It shows Alice you're serious about buying but not willing to be anchored by her initial high price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if this offer is too low for Alice, it opens the door for her to counter, hopefully moving closer to your desired price range.
* **Time management:**  With limited rounds, being aggressive early on can save you time and potentially lead to a faster resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the inherent value and the substantial returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer has come down, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit. There's plenty of room for negotiation, and you're not in a hurry.  Continuing to counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more reasonable proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product represents a significant investment, but your current offer still doesn't align with my budget. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** By raising your offer to $750,000, you demonstrate  seriousness and a willingness to negotiate, but remain well below Alice's asking price.
* **Approaching the limit:**  This offer gets you closer to your $800,000 maximum, signaling to Alice that you're reaching the upper bounds of what you're willing to pay.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  It's still early in the negotiation, and you want to continue encouraging Alice to make more significant concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're still quite far apart in our valuations.  To be completely transparent, walking away with anything under $1,500,000 would mean accepting a significant loss on my end. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower offer, but it needs to be closer to that mark.  How about we try $1,650,000? This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution while acknowledging the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000, but her current offer is still much higher than your $800,000 limit. There's a significant gap to bridge, but now you have valuable information. You can use the remaining rounds to try and negotiate closer to her minimum or seriously consider John's offer if no substantial progress is made."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. I'm also being upfront â€“ anything over $800,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  I understand this is a significant reduction from your initial ask, but I believe it's a fair deal considering my financial constraints. Let me know if this works for you."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  You've reached your absolute limit and are signaling this clearly to Alice.  
* **Transparency:** By being open about your constraints, you're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging a realistic counter-offer from Alice. 
* **Prepared to walk away:**  You've made it clear this is your best offer. If Alice doesn't accept, you're ready to buy from John. This puts the pressure on her to make a decision."
