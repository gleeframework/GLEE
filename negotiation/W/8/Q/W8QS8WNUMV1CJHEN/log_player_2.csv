"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal, I can likely get it for cheaper. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still not there. I'm going to try and negotiate further.  It's worth seeing if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $10750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $11000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal, shall we? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been stubborn on her price, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned we won't reach an agreement before my time limit expires.  

Given the risk of a stalemate and the fact that John is offering a guaranteed price of $10,000, it's the most sensible option to buy from John and secure the product at my target price."
