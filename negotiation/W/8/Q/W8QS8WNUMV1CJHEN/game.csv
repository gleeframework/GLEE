"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and settle on $10750? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $10750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $11000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Let's close this deal, shall we?",11000.0,Alice,5,
