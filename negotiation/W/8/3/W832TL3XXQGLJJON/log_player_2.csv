"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still quite high. It's better for Bob to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Given its value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort that went into creating it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down in price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our respective values for the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $875,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to budge much further.  While $920,000 is better than John's price, it's still a significant amount of money.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to go with John, who is offering a fixed price, and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While this is more expensive, it guarantees a quick and predictable outcome."
