,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too far below what I need. Let's try $10,200.  That's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still too far below what I need. Let's try $10,100. That's a small step closer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. It's a great deal for both of us.",10100.0,Alice,7,
