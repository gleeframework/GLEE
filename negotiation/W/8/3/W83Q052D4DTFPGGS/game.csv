"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price given the value to me, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is a fair compromise, considering your need to sell and my budget constraints. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
