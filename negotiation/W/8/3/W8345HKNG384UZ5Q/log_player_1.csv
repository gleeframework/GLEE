Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Potential for higher profit:**  A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a 50% profit margin. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you might adjust your offer."
