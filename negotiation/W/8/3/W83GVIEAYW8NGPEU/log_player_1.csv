Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and it's still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm also hoping that the high price will signal to Bob that the product is valuable and he might be willing to pay a good price for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not desperate for a deal."

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
