"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to get the price down a bit. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth a premium.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,500.** This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  Bob could try to get the price down further, but there's no guarantee Alice will accept another counteroffer.  
* **Accepting saves time and effort.**  Continuing the negotiation might take more time and might not result in a better deal.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the most logical choice to achieve Bob's goal of buying the product while saving money."
