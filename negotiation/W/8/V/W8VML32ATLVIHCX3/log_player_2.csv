"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $850000.  It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let's start with a strong offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You've set your limit at $800,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the logical first step."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000?  That's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
