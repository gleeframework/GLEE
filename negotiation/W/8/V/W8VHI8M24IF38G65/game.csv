"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit.

Would you be willing to meet me at $120 for the product and the bonus?",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus offer, Alice, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you at $119, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me there?",119.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can sell it to you for $122, and I'll throw in the bonus I mentioned earlier. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",122.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $121, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",121.0,Bob,10,
