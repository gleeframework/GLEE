{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts in the middle ground, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit beyond my minimum.  It also opens the door for negotiation, which is important in this scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $107.50 for the product. This still allows us to share the cost fairly while keeping the transaction within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $107.50 is still above my minimum of $100 and allows me to get a little more profit than I would get by selling to John. I'm accepting his offer to finalize the deal."
