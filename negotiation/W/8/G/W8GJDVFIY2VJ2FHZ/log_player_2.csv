Let's negotiate. Alice's first offer is way too high.  We have room to go much lower and still get a deal that works for both of us."

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off. We need to signal we're willing to negotiate but stand firm on not going too high. Let's see if we can get her closer to our range."

This is getting close. Alice is definitely feeling the pressure, but we're still above our walk-away price. One more counter-offer should do the trick."

I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other opportunities.

It seems we've reached an impasse with Alice. She's not budging, and we've hit our limit.  It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John.  We'll save $25,000 and avoid further negotiation."
