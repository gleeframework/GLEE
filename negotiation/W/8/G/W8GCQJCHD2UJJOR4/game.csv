"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,750 is a good price for the product, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is the last time I'll be willing to adjust the price, as I really believe it's worth more than that. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
