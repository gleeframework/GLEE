"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $12,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product while still giving you a decent profit.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good profit, but $13,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go to $13,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my target price and still allows you to make a decent profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",13000.0,Bob,8,
