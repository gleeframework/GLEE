Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I've started with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message highlighting the product's value and opening the door for discussion.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while ensuring a sale. I've started with a high offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new offer.  If negotiations stall, I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could come to a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000 and also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in my best interest to settle for such a low price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a new offer. I'll need to find a balance between a price that's acceptable to me and one that's still attractive to Bob.  I want to keep the negotiation going, but I also need to protect my profits."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered with a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** I've emphasized the desire for a ""fair deal"" and ""mutual happiness."" This approach is designed to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's still profitable for me while remaining attractive to Bob.  I've made it clear that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial interests. The hope is that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1250000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still falls short of my target. I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground while still protecting my profits. I'll carefully consider my next offer, keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, I'm still not comfortable going lower than $1,275,000.  This price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and it's also a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm confident we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I've countered with $1,275,000. This is halfway between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000. This shows willingness to compromise while still remaining within a reasonable price range for me.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes ""fairness"" and ""working together"" to find a solution. I'm aiming to keep the negotiations positive and encourage Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that both Bob and I can agree on.  This counteroffer is a final attempt to bridge the gap between our expectations. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000.  However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll make one more offer: $1230000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see that I'm making a genuine effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's clear that we are far apart on price, and further negotiation is unlikely to get us closer. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth the risk of further negotiations that might lead to an even lower offer or a stalemate. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and guarantees that I reach my minimum acceptable price."
