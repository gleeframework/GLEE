{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're not immediately selling yourself short.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, but also consider that a long, drawn-out negotiation might not be worth the effort if you can get a decent price quickly from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $10,500, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10250. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  Given Bob's willingness to negotiate and the potential for further rounds that might drag on, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $10,250."
