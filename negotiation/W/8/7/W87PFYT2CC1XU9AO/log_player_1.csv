Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is possible are between $1,200,001 (Bob's bare minimum) and $1,499,999 (your maximum before John's offer is more appealing).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've seen its potential, and I believe it can make a significant difference in your business. I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its value and the benefits it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still securing a significant profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the product's value and avoids any sense of urgency regarding John's offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially offering"" implies you're open to discussing the price. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive starting price might be better."
