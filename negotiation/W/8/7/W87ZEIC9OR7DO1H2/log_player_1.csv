Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price but still allows for some negotiation room. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts, you've secured a good deal.
* **Open the door for negotiation:** If he rejects, you can use his counteroffer to gauge his true willingness to pay and refine your strategy accordingly. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your ideal price. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can counter with a price closer to your target and see if Bob is willing to compromise further. 
* **Selling to John is your safety net.**  If negotiations with Bob break down, you can always secure your minimum price with John. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to your ideal price of $1,200,000.  This will allow you to continue to gauge Bob's interest and see if you can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  This offer is a significant step down from your previous offer but still maintains a good profit margin for you.
* **Show a willingness to negotiate:** By lowering your price, you demonstrate flexibility and increase the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain a position of strength:** $950,000 is still significantly higher than what Bob offered, reminding him that you have a strong position.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Observe Bob's reaction:**  If he accepts, you've secured a good price. If he rejects, prepare to adjust your strategy based on his next offer.
2. **Be ready to go back to John:** Remember, you can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer, but still not ideal.** While $900,000 is a significant improvement from his initial offer, it's still below your desired profit margin.
* **You can potentially get closer to your target price.** You have more room to negotiate and can likely secure a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John is still your safety net.** Selling to John guarantees your minimum price, allowing you to take a calculated risk with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price slightly above his $900,000 offer. This will show your willingness to compromise while keeping the pressure on Bob to reach a deal closer to your desired price.  Aim for a price between $900,000 and $950,000, depending on how confident you feel about your ability to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  How about $925,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let's aim for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller increment:**  This shows you're taking his offer seriously while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Highlight fairness:**  Emphasize that the proposed price is fair to both parties, making it easier for Bob to accept.
* **Focus on finality:**  Suggest that $925,000 could be a final agreement to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, you've secured a good price. If he rejects, you'll need to decide if you want to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
2. **Be prepared for a final decision:**  You've reached a point where you need to decide whether you're willing to accept Bob's price or stick with John's offer."
