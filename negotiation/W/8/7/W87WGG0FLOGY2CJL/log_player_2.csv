{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60."", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much bargaining room there is. This leaves space for negotiation while still staying under my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. I believe this product will be very beneficial for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

""message"": ""I understand the value of the product, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $70?"",

}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price well below her last offer and under my $80 limit."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is holding firm above my $80 limit and calling it her final offer. It's time to walk away and take John's offer, even if it means not getting a discount."
