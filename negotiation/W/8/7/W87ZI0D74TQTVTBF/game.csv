"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? It's a significant offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
