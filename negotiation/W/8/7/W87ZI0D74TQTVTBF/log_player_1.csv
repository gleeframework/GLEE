{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? It's a significant offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and a significant loss for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I want and what John is offering.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, so I'll choose that option."
