"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to consider your product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $12,000. ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $12,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
