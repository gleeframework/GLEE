"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, but I can't go any higher. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is below my threshold.  This product offers significant value that perhaps we haven't fully explored.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
