"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you too.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1,025,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
