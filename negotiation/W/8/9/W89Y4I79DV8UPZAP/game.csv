"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,050,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you've reached your maximum offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering $1,025,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
