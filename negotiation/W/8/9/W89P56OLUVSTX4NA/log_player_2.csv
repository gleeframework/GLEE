"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I understand this is a significant investment, so I encourage you to ask any questions you may have. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no benefit to accepting it.  You know you can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no reason to take a risk on Alice's product, especially since she's hinted at a lower price for a different buyer.  You're better off playing it safe and going with John."
