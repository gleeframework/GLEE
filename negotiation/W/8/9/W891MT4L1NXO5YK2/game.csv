,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. It's worth significantly more to you than that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not close to what this product is worth to you. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
