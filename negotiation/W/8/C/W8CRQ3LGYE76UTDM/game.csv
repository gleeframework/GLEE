"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on this unique item.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I have in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1150000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer! I'm very interested in this product, but I'm still capped at $1200000.  It's a firm number for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this unique item.  What do you think?  Are you willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1200000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1225000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,7,
