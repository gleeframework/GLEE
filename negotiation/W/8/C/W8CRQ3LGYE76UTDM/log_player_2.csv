Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on this unique item.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I have in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1150000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to take another round of negotiation to see if I can get her down to my target price of $1,200,000 or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer! I'm very interested in this product, but I'm still capped at $1,200,000.  It's a firm number for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this unique item.  What do you think?  Are you willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1200000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1225000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,225,000, which is still $25,000 higher than my target price of $1,200,000. Since this is her final offer, I'm not likely to get her to go lower. Rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially miss out on the product, I'll choose to purchase it from John for $1,200,000."
