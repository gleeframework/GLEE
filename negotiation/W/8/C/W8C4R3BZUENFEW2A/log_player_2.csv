"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try and negotiate for a better price, especially when you know the product is worth less to you than it is to the seller.  Starting with a rejection allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value it holds for me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I want to see if I can get a price closer to my limit before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you and the fact that you're willing to pay $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth to me, while also acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is being stubborn, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,125,000. I'll try one more counteroffer, and if she rejects that, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000 as a final offer. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer of $1,110,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. Considering the product's worth to you and the fact that you're willing to pay $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a final compromise that reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to stand by it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has already rejected my final offer, and while she's now offering $1,100,000, it's still not within my budget.  I've reached my limit for this negotiation, and it's time to move on. John offers the product at a price I'm comfortable with, so I'll buy from him."
