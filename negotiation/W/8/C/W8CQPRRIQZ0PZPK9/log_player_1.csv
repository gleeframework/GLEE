"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and allows for some wiggle room in future negotiations. I'm confident that the product is worth at least this much to Bob, but I'm open to negotiation if he rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I still have 9 rounds left, and I'm willing to engage in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $850,000 is a good price and exceeds my minimum of $800,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident that I can get a significantly higher price from Bob, and I'm worried about risking a deal with him altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing out on a sale."
