Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and $9,750 is a solid profit.  Better to take the sure thing than risk losing him entirely."
