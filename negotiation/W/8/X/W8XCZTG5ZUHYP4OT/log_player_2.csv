"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your operations.  I'm asking for $2000000 for it.  I know this is a substantial investment, but I'm sure you'll find the potential return to be well worth it.  Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me, and I can get it from John for a much better price.
