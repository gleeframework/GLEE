Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 means losing out on $50,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
