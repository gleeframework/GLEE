{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit above my minimum ($10,000).
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
