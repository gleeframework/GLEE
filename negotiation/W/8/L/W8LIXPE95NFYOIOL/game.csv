"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,500, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider this compromise?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $10,250 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,400.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,400, so I'll offer $10,200. Can you consider this compromise?",10200.0,Bob,6,
