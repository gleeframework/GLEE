Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""backup"" price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially making him feel like he got a better deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
