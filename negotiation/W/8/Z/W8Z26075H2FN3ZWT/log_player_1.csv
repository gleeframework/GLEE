Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is enticing to Bob (meaning it's below his perceived value) but also maximizes your profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it's worth significantly more in the right hands. I'm willing to make a special offer of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth more than his initial assessment.
* **Strategic Price:** $925,000 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a $75,000 discount (making it attractive) while still netting you a significant profit above your guarantee.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a more generous offer."
