"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'm willing to go up to $820000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you consider this price?",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $820000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $840000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,
