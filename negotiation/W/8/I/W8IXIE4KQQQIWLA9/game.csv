I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exceptional product that I think you'll really love. I'm excited to share it with you. My initial offer is $1200000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it.,1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1000000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My revised offer is $1200000, but I'm willing to come down to $1150000 to make it more appealing to you. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far apart from $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1150000, which would be $1100000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1100000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $1075000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
