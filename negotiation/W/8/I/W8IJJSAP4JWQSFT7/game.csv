"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my offer of $13000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns at $13000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $14000. This is the last time I'll be making a concession, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm going to stick with my offer of $13000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now. It's your call, but I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
