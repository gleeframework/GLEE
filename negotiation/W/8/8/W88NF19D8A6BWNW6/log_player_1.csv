Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $120 value to Bob, leaving space for him to potentially counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message is friendly and explains the offer clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.  You're in a good position because:

* **You have a backup buyer:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John for $80. 
* **Bob is interested:** He's willing to negotiate, so there's a chance you can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $92.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer is the midpoint between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still value your product.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and explains the counteroffer clearly. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $92.50 is still higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise and very close to your counteroffer of $92.50.  It's also significantly higher than your minimum price of $80 and your backup option of selling to John for $80. Accepting this offer is the best option in this scenario."
