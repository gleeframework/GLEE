"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get the price down further.  There are still several rounds to go, and Bob can try to reach a price closer to his ideal price of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This price is still within my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen.  How about $10,900? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While Bob ideally wanted to pay $10,500, $10,900 is still a better deal than buying from John at $12,000.  There's a good chance that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might walk away, and he'd be stuck with John's higher price. It's best to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
