"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's offer of $1,100,000. This price is still above Alice's valuation of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but closer to his valuation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and secure a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing for a price closer to Alice's valuation.  Offering $1,000,000 demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's at her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is now very close to Bob's previous offer of $1,000,000.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will only lead to a small reduction in price, and it's likely that Alice will be firm at this point.  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids the risk of the negotiations collapsing, especially with only 5 rounds remaining."
