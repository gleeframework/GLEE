Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I think $85 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  It's a good compromise, and I'm getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could potentially push for a bit more, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
