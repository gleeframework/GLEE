"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be valuable to me, but that price is not feasible.  How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, this product offers significant value that justifies a higher investment.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, to be realistic, $1,800,000 is still  too high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  This product's potential for your business is significant, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset.  To find a compromise, I could come down to $1,550,000. This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely making progress, but there's still a gap between us. I can see the value in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  That's a significant investment on my end, but I believe it would be mutually beneficial.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
