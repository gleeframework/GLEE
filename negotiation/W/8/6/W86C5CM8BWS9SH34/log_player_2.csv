"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and it's not worth risking a higher price.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees the best price for me."
