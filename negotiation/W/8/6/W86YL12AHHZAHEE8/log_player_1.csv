Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value Bob will get.  
* **Risk:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, if he does, I can still sell it to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit while also considering the possibility that Bob might not accept the offer."
