"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is a bit high considering her product's value to her. There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Aiming for below value:** My goal is to buy the product for less than its worth to Alice ($100).
* **Considering Alternatives:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $150. This gives me a walk-away point in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met me in the middle. $105 is a reasonable price, saving me $45 compared to John's offer, and it's likely close to the best I can negotiate."
