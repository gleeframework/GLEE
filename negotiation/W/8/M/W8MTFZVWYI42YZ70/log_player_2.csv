Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $105, and it's clear I can get the product for $100 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed better price."
