{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $9,500 is still above Bob's ideal price range, and he has room to negotiate.
* **There are 9 rounds left.** This gives Bob time to try and get a better price from Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.** This ensures Bob can get the product if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no pressure to accept a deal that's not beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:**  Bob starts with a lower price than Alice's offer, demonstrating his intent to negotiate. 
* **Within Bob's budget:** This offer is within Bob's maximum limit of $12,000, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Consideration of Alice's value:** This offer is slightly above what the product is worth to Alice, giving her some incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **There are 7 rounds left:** Time is still on Bob's side. He can keep trying to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a backup:**  Bob is not desperate to buy from Alice and can comfortably reject this offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **Rounds remaining:** There are still 5 rounds left, giving Bob time to continue negotiating. 
* **John is still a backup:** This allows Bob to reject the offer without feeling pressured.

The goal is to get closer to Bob's desired price range without giving in too quickly. Rejecting and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy at this point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. A small increase from his last offer signals that he's serious about making a deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will test how much Alice is willing to lower her price to close the deal.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, Bob is starting to apply a little more pressure to encourage Alice to make a decision."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is stubborn.** She keeps offering a price higher than Bob's ideal, indicating she might be willing to go lower, but she's not making significant concessions.
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic. He can't afford to waste time with offers that are too far from his target.
* **John is a reliable option.**  If this negotiation falls through, Bob can secure the product from John for a price that is still within his budget.

By rejecting this offer, Bob can make a final counteroffer in the next round. If Alice still doesn't budge, he can safely buy from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is a strong counteroffer, pushing close to Bob's maximum. It shows a willingness to close the deal, but also a firm stance on price.
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, this creates a sense of urgency for Alice.
* **Evaluating the risk:** Bob is willing to risk buying from John if Alice rejects, as it's a safe backup.

This counteroffer is a high-risk, high-reward move. If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product for a good price. If she rejects, he can buy from John with a minimal loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's still above Bob's ideal range, and there's only one round left. 
* **No time for further negotiation.**  With only one round remaining, there's no time for further negotiation. Bob needs to make a decision.
* **John is the better option.**  Buying from John ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget.  

Even though Bob could make one more counteroffer, it's unlikely that Alice will drop her price enough in one round. Buying from John is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees the product within his price limit."
