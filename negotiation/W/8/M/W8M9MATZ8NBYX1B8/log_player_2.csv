"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a price that's below its worth to you, and I get a sale that's closer to my target price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving $200,000."
