"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something you'll value highly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can get it from John for $100.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  Since John's price is your upper limit, you can use that as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you trying to work with me.  While I'm interested, $95 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
