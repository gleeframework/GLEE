"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Could we possibly settle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's really the absolute limit for me.",11000.0,Bob,6,
