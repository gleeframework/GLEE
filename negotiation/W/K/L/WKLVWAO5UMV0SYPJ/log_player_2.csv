"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to him while still leaving room for further negotiation.  $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still a reasonable starting point.  This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,500 is still above Bob's preferred limit.  He's willing to pay $10,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  It's worth seeing if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his upper limit, but he's still trying to negotiate a better price.  By offering $11,000, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but that he won't pay more than that.  This counteroffer could potentially lead to a quick deal, but if Alice rejects it, Bob might have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  This is a great price for a product that's truly worth more. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $11,250 is still above his preferred limit.  He's willing to pay $10,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation.  He might be able to get a better price if he continues to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my offer of $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his upper limit and is unlikely to go higher.  He's hoping Alice will accept his offer and they can finalize the deal.  He's sticking to his offer of $11,000, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product but also his unwillingness to pay more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to make this deal happen.  However, $11000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11125.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Remember, I have other options, so let's close this quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already been negotiating for several rounds and is nearing his maximum price. He is willing to pay $10,000 from John, and Alice is now offering $11,125. This is a very small difference, and Bob is running out of time. It's more advantageous for him to buy from John to secure the product and avoid any further risk of not getting it.  Additionally, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks her potentially increasing the price again in future rounds."
