"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to make this deal happen.  However, $11000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11125.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.
