"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,800,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering its worth to you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm capped at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,600,000 for the product. This is a compromise that should benefit both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. How about we settle at $1,400,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. My final counteroffer is $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
