"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That would be a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $925,000 is closer, but still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers - let's try $962,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
