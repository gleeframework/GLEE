"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price. Let's start at $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  How about $975,000?  I think this is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering you a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I've already made some significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. However, I'm willing to make one final offer that's slightly higher than your counteroffer. I'm offering you a price of $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
