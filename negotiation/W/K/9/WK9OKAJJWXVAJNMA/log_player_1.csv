Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($100). 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John provides a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob."
