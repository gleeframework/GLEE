"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers me, and it leaves some room for you to still make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident in its potential for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
