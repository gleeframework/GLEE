Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Reservation Price:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. This is his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Knowing John's Guaranteed Price:** We are secure knowing John will buy the product for our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering the product at $1,100,000, we aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while leaving room for negotiation if he counter-offers. This strategy maximizes the chance of a sale to Bob at a price higher than $800,000.

**Important Note:** There is always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes the potential profit while considering the information available."
