"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1800000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one more offer: $1725000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
