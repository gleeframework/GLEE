Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 may be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth to you.
