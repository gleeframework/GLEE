"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I can offer $650,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a realistic price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, we need to bridge a significant gap in our valuations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still too high. I can go up to $800,000. This is my final offer; otherwise, I will need to consider purchasing from another seller.",800000.0,Bob,6,
