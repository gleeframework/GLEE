Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We are willing to negotiate, but we need to see more significant movement from his side."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has reached his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000.  While he might be using a negotiation tactic, it's clear he won't go any higher. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. There's no point in further negotiation rounds as it's highly unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer.  It's more profitable to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
