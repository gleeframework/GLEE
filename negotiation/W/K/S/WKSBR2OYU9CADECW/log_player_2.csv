"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $12,000. There's a risk of further negotiation, but it's likely Alice won't go lower, making this a good opportunity to close the deal."
