Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  The offered price is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a decent deal. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher gives you some wiggle room if Bob attempts to negotiate down. 
 
It's important to remember that this is just one possible approach. There are other valid strategies depending on factors like your risk tolerance and how much you need to secure the sale quickly."
