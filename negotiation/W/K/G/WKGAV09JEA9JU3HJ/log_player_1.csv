"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $950,000 is close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, increasing the chances of him accepting or making a counteroffer close to your desired range.
* **Confident Language:** The language used is positive and emphasizes the value of the product without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  It's clear there's room for negotiation. You have leverage knowing John will buy the product for $800,000, so it makes sense to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** By moving significantly closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $875,000 counteroffer is a strong midpoint between Bob's offer ($750,000) and your starting price ($950,000). It keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price while still being enticing to Bob. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The language emphasizes finding a fair price that reflects the product's value, not just haggling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. How about $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and represents a significant profit. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if you reject this offer.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a lower offer later or having to settle for John's $800,000."
