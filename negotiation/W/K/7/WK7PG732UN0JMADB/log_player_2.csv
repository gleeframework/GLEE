I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's offer and my maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still demonstrating that I believe the product is worth less than her initial price."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my offer and me having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
