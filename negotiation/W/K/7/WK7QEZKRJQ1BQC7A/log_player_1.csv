Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is interesting, I think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

Bob is clearly committed to a slow and incremental approach.  While we could likely squeeze out a bit more, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that makes continuing these negotiations worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a very good deal at this point."
