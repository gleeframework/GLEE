Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't go beyond $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a significantly better result given his ""final offer"" statement. Accepting his offer means a $500,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's strategically sound to cut our losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
