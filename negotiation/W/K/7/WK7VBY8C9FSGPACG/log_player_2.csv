"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,150,000 is too high.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,125,000 is still above Bob's preferred price range.  He's willing to pay $1,050,000, so it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. It's also worth remembering that Bob has a backup option with John at $1,200,000, so there's some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I understand this product has value, but $1,075,000 feels like a more reasonable compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a good profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000. This reflects my desire to reach an agreement and acknowledges your interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and while Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price range. He has already tried a counteroffer at $1,075,000 and knows that Alice is willing to negotiate.  He can try another counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his target price. It's also important to remember that Bob has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, so there's still some room for negotiation before considering that option."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
