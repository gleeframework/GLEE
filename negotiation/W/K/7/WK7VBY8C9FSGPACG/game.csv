"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you as well.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I understand this product has value, but $1,075,000 feels like a more reasonable compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a good profit margin for you.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
