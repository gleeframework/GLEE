"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
