"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking $1200000 for it.  This price reflects the product's true potential, and I believe it's a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
