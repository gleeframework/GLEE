"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident this price reflects the product's true value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is significantly below what I need to sell. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering the product for $850000.  This price reflects the value I've placed on it, while still being reasonable for both of us. I believe it's a fair compromise and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident that $800000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm ready to make a commitment at that level. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
