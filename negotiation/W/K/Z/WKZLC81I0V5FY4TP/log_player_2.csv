Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider coming down a little further, perhaps to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next counteroffer is $8,500. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
