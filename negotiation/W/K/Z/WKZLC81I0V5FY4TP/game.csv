"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider coming down a little further, perhaps to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next counteroffer is $8,500. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
