Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you closer to your desired price.
* **Balance with Bob's Valuation:** While $145 is above Bob's perceived value, it's close enough that he might be willing to pay a premium if he really wants the product. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
