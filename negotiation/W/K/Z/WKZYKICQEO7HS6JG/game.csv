Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1600000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1580000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1580000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
