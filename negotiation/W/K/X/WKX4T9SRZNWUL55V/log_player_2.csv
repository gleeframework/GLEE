{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than your maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget. It should be attractive enough for Alice to consider, but also allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become more stubborn or that you'll run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $110 is a smart move to secure the product at a reasonable cost."
