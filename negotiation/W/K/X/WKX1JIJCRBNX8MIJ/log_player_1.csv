I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I believe Bob will be interested in this offer since it is still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer and still leaves a profit margin for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price of $10,000.  While I would prefer to get even more, I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations, especially since I'd only receive $8,000 from John."
