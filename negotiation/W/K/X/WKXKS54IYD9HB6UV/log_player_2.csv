Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $910,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a very small difference, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You've reached a point where Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget.
* Continuing to negotiate might result in further concessions from Alice, but there's a risk she might walk away.
* Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price close to your goal.
* Buying from John would save you $15,000, but there's no guarantee you can find another seller with a better price in the remaining rounds."
