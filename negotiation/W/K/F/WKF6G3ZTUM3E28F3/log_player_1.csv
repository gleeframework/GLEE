"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal. 
* **First Offer:** It's important to make a strong first offer to set the tone for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, so if Bob is unwilling to negotiate, I can move on to the guaranteed $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss.
* **Staying in the negotiation:** It's still early in the game, and there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is lower than my initial price but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Fair Compromise:** $11,000 is a potential compromise that could be appealing to Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm reminding Bob that I can always sell to John for a higher price, which keeps the pressure on him to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the desire for a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet willing to settle for that amount. 
* **Continuing to negotiate:** I believe there's still room for a higher offer from Bob, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining my leverage:**  The option to sell to John at $15,000 keeps me in a strong negotiating position.
* **Counteroffer in the next round:** I'll offer a price between Bob's current offer and my desired price, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to come up.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $11,250?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Offer:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly in between Bob's last offer ($10,750) and my previous offer ($11,750). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message highlights the ""good compromise"" aspect of the offer, appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message uses language like ""close this deal"" to subtly increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  The option to sell to John is still there, reminding Bob that I'm not desperate to close the deal on his terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm not willing to settle for a loss just yet.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a price that is both fair to me and acceptable to Bob.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** The option to sell to John for $15,000 gives me the power to walk away if the deal isn't good enough.
* **Counteroffer in the next round:** I'll propose a price that's closer to my desired price but still considers Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final concession, reducing my price slightly to show a willingness to close the deal.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests this is the final offer, subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding the option to sell to John, reminding Bob that I can walk away if needed. 

**Note:** This counteroffer is a risky move, as it is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  However, with only a few rounds remaining, it's time to make a decisive move.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial and allows us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,000 is your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, and there are only two rounds left. 
* **Low Profit Margin:**  Bob's offer of $10,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly higher than any price I've been able to negotiate with Bob.  

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit with John.  Although I wanted to close a deal with Bob, his unwillingness to budge on price has made this the best option."
