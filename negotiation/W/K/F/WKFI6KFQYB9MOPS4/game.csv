"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident it will add significant value to your life/work. I'm offering it to you at $140, which is below its market value but still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I cannot lower the price further than $140 due to the cost involved. I would like to offer you the product for $125 instead. This is a price point that still allows me to maintain a fair profit while being competitive in the market. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",125.0,Alice,3,
