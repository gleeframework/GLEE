Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly not budging from his $15,000 offer.  Since John is offering the same amount, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob. It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
