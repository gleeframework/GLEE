Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategic aspects:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this asset. Considering its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming for a price close to that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, giving you a strong position. Bob doesn't need to know the specifics of this, but your confidence implies you have options.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a more balanced offer might be preferred."
