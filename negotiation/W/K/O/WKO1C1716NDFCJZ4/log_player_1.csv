Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left some space for negotiation, understanding Bob might try to bring the price down.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value while expressing a willingness to negotiate. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's a significant drop from my initial asking price. I know the product is worth much more to him. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any price and am willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can still reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle.  While not a perfect split, it leans more towards my initial price, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating that the product is worth a premium price, hoping to nudge Bob closer to my range.
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:** The language remains respectful and solution-oriented, indicating I'm invested in finding a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more like $1,200,000.  Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is still $200,000 above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a healthy profit margin.
* **Avoiding Further Risk:** While I might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and I risk him walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner.

Accepting this offer provides a strong balance between maximizing profit and mitigating the risk of losing the sale altogether."
