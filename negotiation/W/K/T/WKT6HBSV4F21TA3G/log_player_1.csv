"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to capture some of the surplus. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, recognizing your willingness to negotiate. This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with that number. I believe I can get closer to $8,000 with further negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to go a little further to meet you halfway. How about $7,500? That's a fair price for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $7,200 to make this deal happen. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my target price that I'm willing to accept it.  I've made significant progress in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for a higher price."
