""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. After considering its value, I am willing to offer $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below its potential value to him and my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth significantly more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Considering the product's potential and after further reflection, I would like to propose an offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now very close to my original asking price, and this offer represents a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting ensures a successful deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
