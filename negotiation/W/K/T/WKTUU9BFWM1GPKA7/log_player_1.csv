Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we want to start higher than Bob's perceived value to see if we can maximize profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and demand without being too aggressive.  It provides Bob with a reason to consider the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for potential negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price above $15,000."
