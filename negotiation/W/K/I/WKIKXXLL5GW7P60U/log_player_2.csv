"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above my budget and what I'm willing to pay. I'll try countering again to see if I can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, Alice. How about $70?  That's a significant jump from my original offer and a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another small adjustment and offer it to you for $85. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to my limit, but I know John will sell it to me for $80. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can get a slightly better deal before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're very close to a price I'd be comfortable with.  Would you consider $75? I think that's a really fair offer at this point."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to a price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at $75. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $82. This is the best I can do, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and I'm not going to get the price down to $75. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $80.  It's not worth potentially overpaying just to try and squeeze a few more dollars out of the deal with Alice."
