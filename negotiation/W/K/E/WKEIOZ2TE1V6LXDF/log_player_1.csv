This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above my minimum but leaves room for bargaining.  I believe this strategy will maximize my chances of getting a good deal while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for me and still give you a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It's important to hold firm on my minimum value and try to negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John. Rejecting his offer will allow me to counter with a price closer to my target."
