"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for me and still give you a profit.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to continue working with you. However, $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,425,000? This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
