"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $14,000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations lower than your target price, leaving room to move up.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and acknowledges the value of the product. 
* **Target Zone:**  My goal is to buy for under $15,000, and Alice values the product at $12,000.  An offer of $11,000 leaves room for negotiation within that range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  Alice is now offering the product for $13,000, which is $2,000 less than my maximum budget and $2,000 less than buying from John.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by meeting me halfway. This suggests it's unlikely she'll go much lower. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
