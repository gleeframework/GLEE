"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. It's a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is still willing to pay a premium to avoid going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price. There are still multiple rounds left, and it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids having to go through a third party."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, and he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product. This offer is a good compromise and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
