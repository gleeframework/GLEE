"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to create a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm  countering with a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids having to go through a third party. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for me. It's higher than my minimum, and it avoids the hassle of dealing with John. I'll accept his offer and move on."
