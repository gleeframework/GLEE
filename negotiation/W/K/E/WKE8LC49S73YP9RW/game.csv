"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids having to go through a third party.",10500.0,Bob,4,
