"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a favorable deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob why this product is worth a significant investment to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative. While my initial price is firm, the wording implies a willingness to discuss further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about obtaining a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob is open to meeting closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget. While your offer is appreciated, it falls significantly short of what I consider fair value for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns but reiterate that his previous offer was too low.  
* **Meeting Halfway:** Offering $1,000,000 splits the difference between his counteroffer and my initial price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Clear and Simple:** I'm keeping the language direct and avoiding overly aggressive tactics. The goal is to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the current offer is still $50,000 below my target of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for him to move closer to my desired price, especially since he values the product significantly higher. I'll continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, at this point, moving below $980,000 would be selling this product short. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver immense value. What do you say we close this deal at that price?"", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Limit:** I'm clearly stating my bottom line ($980,000) to signal firmness without ending negotiations.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm shifting emphasis back to the product's benefits to justify the price and potentially sway Bob.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm ending with a direct suggestion to close the deal, adding a sense of urgency and opportunity."
