Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable compromise between my minimum price ($80) and the estimated value Bob places on the product ($120).  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a feeling of getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and maximizes my profit."
