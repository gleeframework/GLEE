"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is within his budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a middle-ground counteroffer. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still offers her a profit. This gives Bob a strong starting point for negotiation and allows him to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn and raising her offer.  It's tempting to accept because it's closer to Bob's initial price, but he's still paying more than the product is worth to Alice.  Bob can still try to negotiate a better price, and he's not running out of rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but also that he's not willing to pay Alice's asking price. This is a subtle push towards a deal, and with several rounds remaining, Bob is still in a good position to haggle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing back again with an even higher price. This indicates that she is not very willing to lower her price.  However, Bob is still not at his maximum price point, and he has several rounds left. It's worth continuing to try and negotiate a better price. He still has time to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer but still keeping it below the product's value to him.  He's showing Alice he's serious about getting a deal, but also that he's not desperate. With time running out, Bob is trying to see if he can find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now asking for a price that is higher than the product's worth to Bob. It is clear that Alice is unwilling to negotiate further.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he is at a significant disadvantage. With only a few rounds left, he risks wasting more time and ending up paying more than he's willing.

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at a slightly higher price than he'd like, but it's still within his budget and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice.  This minimizes the chance of overpaying and ensures he gets the product without any further delay."
