Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$150:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to start a conversation. It also establishes that I'm open to negotiation, which could make Bob more likely to engage.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high starting point while signaling a willingness to compromise.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response and the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations."
