"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
