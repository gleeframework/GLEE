"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm open to offers, but I know its value is at least $120.  Let's start with a price of $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price is your maximum price, and she acknowledges the product's value is at least $120. This suggests there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer gives you an opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** We're aiming for a price below Alice's initial offer, but also respecting her stated value of $120.
* **Negotiation space:** A $20 drop from $150 to $130 gives Alice some room to negotiate but also signals our seriousness in wanting the product. 
* **Message:**  We're friendly but firm, expressing interest while clearly stating our price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's compromise at $140.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to our target price of $130. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise or we'll run out of rounds. 
* **Value:** $140 is still within our budget and a good deal considering the product's value and Alice's initial asking price."
