"I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to offer you a better price later. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
