"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you don't know Alice's true value, you can likely get a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It's a bold move, but it signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.  The hope is that she'll either accept or come back with a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price.  It's a good strategy for starting the negotiation and seeing how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my initial offer, but still higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target of $600,000.  There's still a good chance Alice will come down in price to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm serious about getting a deal but also willing to be flexible. Hopefully, this will entice Alice to accept or at least come closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is a good compromise.  It's not quite my ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a lower price, but it's a risk.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept further counteroffers, and I could end up paying more if I reject and she makes a higher counteroffer or I decide to buy from John. 

At this point, it's wiser to accept and secure the product at a price that's a good deal, rather than risk losing the opportunity for a better price altogether."
