# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting, Bob can get the product from John for a lower price."
