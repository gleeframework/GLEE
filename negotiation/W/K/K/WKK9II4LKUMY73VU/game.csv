"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the quality and value this product offers.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, so I'll offer $127.50. This is my final offer as well.",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made a concession to $130, and you're asking me to meet you halfway between $125 and $130. I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, and I'm not willing to split the difference again. I'm sticking with my last offer of $130. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",130.0,Alice,7,
