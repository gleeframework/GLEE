"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm looking to get $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if he's seriously interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming in with a counteroffer. However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, would you be willing to sell the product for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with what I could get from John.  It's best to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
