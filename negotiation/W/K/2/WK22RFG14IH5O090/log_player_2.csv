Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has been stubborn, and while the price is getting closer to his limit, it's still above his maximum budget.  He's already spent 6 rounds trying to negotiate and has reached his limit.  Buying from John at $12,000 guarantees him the product at a price he's comfortable with."
