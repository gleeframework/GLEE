"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $15,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $15,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $14,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $13,500 for the product.  This price is fair and allows us to both reach an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250. This is the final price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",14250.0,Alice,7,
