"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have a bottom line, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll try to reach a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $75? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
