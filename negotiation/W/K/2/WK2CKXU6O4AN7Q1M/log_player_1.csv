Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $12,000, given its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product significantly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a higher price. 

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price favorable to Alice."
