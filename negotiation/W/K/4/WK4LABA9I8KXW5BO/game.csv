"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. I'm still a bit too high at $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $875,000 to $862,500, so I'll offer $868,750. It's a slight concession from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",868750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value this product,  $868,750 is still slightly outside of my budget.  Let's meet in the middle again and settle on $860,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more concession and offer $865,000. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider other options.",865000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and understanding.  $865,000 is still just a bit above my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go to $862,500.  Let's close this deal and get the product to you. This is my final offer.",862500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more concession, but this is as low as I can go. I'll offer $863,750. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",863750.0,Alice,9,
