Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right away. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me."

Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer, which is my minimum, but I've already rejected a counteroffer from him. I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
