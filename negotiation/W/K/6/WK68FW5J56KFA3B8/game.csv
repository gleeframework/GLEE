"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great value, and I think you'll find it worth every penny.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only stretch to $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. I think this is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Is there any way you could meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,6,
