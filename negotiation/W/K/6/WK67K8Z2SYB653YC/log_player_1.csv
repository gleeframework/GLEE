Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). While it's unlikely he'll accept this initial offer, it keeps the door open for further discussion. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  The offer is below John's guaranteed purchase price ($150), ensuring Alice a profit if Bob accepts.

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. If Bob outright rejects this offer, she can gradually lower the price until she reaches a point she's no longer willing to go lower than (close to $150)."
