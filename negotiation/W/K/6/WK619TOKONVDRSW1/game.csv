"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair price and closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
