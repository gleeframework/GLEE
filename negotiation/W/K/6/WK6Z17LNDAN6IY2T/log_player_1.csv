I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while hopefully still being attractive to Bob. I'm interested in seeing if I can get a higher price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable price, but I'm prepared to go to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, but it's closer to my minimum value and a better deal than selling to John.  I'm going to accept his offer."
