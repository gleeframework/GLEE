Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that is profitable for you.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your absolute bottom line, hinting at the product's value provides a basis for your asking price and may make Bob more amenable to a higher offer.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (which could be interpreted as selling to John), you subtly introduce the concept of scarcity and potential competition, prompting Bob to act sooner."
