Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $15,000 is closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget. $15,000 is still a bit below my value. How about we split the difference and go with $16,500? This way, I can still make a reasonable profit, and you get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, could we aim for $15500? This would allow us both to reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $15,500 is a good compromise.  I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.  $15,500 is still significantly better than selling to John."
