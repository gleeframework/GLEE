Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the market value and our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Considering your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with $950,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $950,000 is a $50,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
