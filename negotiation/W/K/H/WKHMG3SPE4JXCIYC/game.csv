"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  How about $8,750?  That's a significant discount from your original offer and a fair compromise, I believe. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and gone down to $9,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,250. That's as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to be fair.  How about $8,900?  That's closer to your last offer, but it's still within my budget, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, but I need to think about my next move. Let me see if I can do any better. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to go to $9,000, I'll sell it to you at that price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
