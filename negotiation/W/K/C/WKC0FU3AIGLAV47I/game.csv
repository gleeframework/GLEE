"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go up to $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
