"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $12,500. This is my final offer, let me know if you can accept it.",12500.0,Bob,4,
