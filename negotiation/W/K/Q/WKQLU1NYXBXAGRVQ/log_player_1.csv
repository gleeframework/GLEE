"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my valuation. I know Bob values the product lower, but I'm hoping to get him to come up a bit. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can still push for a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the initial price, but still aiming for a price above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still holding out for a price closer to my valuation."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm also not ready to sell to John yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my offer again to $10,000, which is my minimum valuation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I've already dropped to my minimum valuation and he's not budging much. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000, which is a good outcome for me."
