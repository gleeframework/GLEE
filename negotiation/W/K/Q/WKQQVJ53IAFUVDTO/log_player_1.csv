Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 2200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $2,200,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. His response will reveal how much he values the product and give me insights for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to acquire the product."
