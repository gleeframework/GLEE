"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum value of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price while still being within the range of what he's willing to pay.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also prepared to negotiate.  He's hoping to strike a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer to $11,250, it's still above Bob's maximum value. He can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.  He still has 7 rounds remaining to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. How about we split the difference at $11,125? This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial counteroffer range but is willing to compromise slightly. He's proposing a middle ground that's closer to his desired price but still leaves room for Alice to feel like she's getting a fair deal. This shows that Bob is willing to work towards a solution while still trying to get the best possible price."
