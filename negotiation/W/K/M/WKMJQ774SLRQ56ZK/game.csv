"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've expressed interest in, for $850000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it will be extremely valuable for you.  Of course, if you decline, I have another interested party ready to purchase at my minimum price.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,1,
