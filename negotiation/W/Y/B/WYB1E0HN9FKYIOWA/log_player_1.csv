Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating, which is essential for a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response.
* If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiation drags on or if I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Room for Improvement:** There's little chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he already offered his maximum.
* **Avoid Risk:** Rejecting and counter-offering carries the risk of Bob walking away, potentially leading to no sale.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk of losing the deal."
