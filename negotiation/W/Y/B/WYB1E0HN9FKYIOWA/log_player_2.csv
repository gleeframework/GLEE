"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
