"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is asking, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. There's a good chance Alice will negotiate down from $120, as the product is only worth $80 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It also keeps you within your budget, as you're only willing to spend $150 at most.  Alice is likely motivated to sell since the product is worth less to her, and a price of $100 would still be profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is closer to my ideal price point, and still within my budget of $150. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject my counteroffer again or offer a price closer to her original offer.  At this point, accepting the offer is the safest option, as it ensures I get the product at a good price without the risk of losing the deal."
