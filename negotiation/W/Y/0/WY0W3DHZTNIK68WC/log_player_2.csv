"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This item holds immense value to us, reflecting years of innovation and dedication. We believe its worth surpasses $1000000, but considering the current market dynamics and the opportunity cost of holding onto it, we are willing to offer it to you at an exclusive price of $950000. We hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, especially since she's already stated the product's value is above $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your understanding of the product's value. After careful consideration, we would like to propose a revised price of $900000 for the product. We believe this offers a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. We look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's desired price point, but closer than her initial offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  Bob can try to bridge the gap a bit further with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We're glad you found our offer more acceptable. After reviewing the situation again, we are prepared to offer the product at $887500. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value of the product and your previous offers. We hope this proposal is satisfactory and looks forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might be risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying more than $887,500.  It's more beneficial to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer."
