"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value this product represents is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and see the value in the product. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000.  I'm willing to meet in the middle and offer $1,300,000. This reflects a compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
