I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a more reasonable price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit, and $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down on her price, her final offer of $825,000 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, it makes more financial sense to purchase the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
