"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a more reasonable price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit, and $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,5,
