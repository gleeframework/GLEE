"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth exploring the negotiation process further to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to save a substantial amount. This is a bold move, but it's reasonable given the product's worth to Alice. If she rejects this, Bob can adjust his offer in the following rounds, but this strong initial counter sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,800 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. It's reasonable to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as there are still several rounds left. Bob may be able to get a better price by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, but it also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and might encourage Alice to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,200 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, Bob is still hoping to get a lower price. Since there are five rounds left, it's still worth continuing to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, he might be able to get closer to his desired price of $6,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer is closer to Alice's last one, potentially encouraging her to accept.  However, Bob is still holding firm on his goal of saving money.  If Alice rejects, Bob will need to decide if he's willing to go higher or consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, he's still within his budget and has several rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get him a better price. It's a risk, but it's worth exploring if he can get closer to his goal of $6,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to Alice's last offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal. This counteroffer might be the point where Alice considers accepting, as Bob is getting closer to her desired price point.  However, if she rejects, Bob will need to seriously consider his next move.  He's running out of rounds and may need to decide if he's willing to pay more or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,800 is very close to Bob's maximum, it's still worth trying one more counteroffer. This is a high-stakes decision, as this is the last round before Bob is forced to buy from John.  If Bob can convince Alice to go down just a little more, he can secure a better deal.  However, if Alice rejects, Bob will have no choice but to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final, all-or-nothing counteroffer. Bob is raising his offer slightly, acknowledging that he's running out of time and Alice might not budge further. If Alice accepts, Bob gets a good deal within his budget. If she rejects, Bob is forced to buy from John, losing out on any potential savings."
