"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I mention the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open-ended Question:**  The question invites Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room to get a higher price. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** I can likely meet Bob halfway in the next round.  
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me the security to hold out for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That seems fair to both of us, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still trying to get a higher price.  I use the phrase ""split the difference"" to make the offer seem fair.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language like ""fair to both of us"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I leave the door open for further negotiation in case Bob wants to counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Value:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, it's likely he'll either walk away or counter with a lower price, making it harder to reach a deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By selling to Bob for $115, I'm securing a profit and avoiding the risk of  losing the deal entirely and having to settle for John's $100 offer."
