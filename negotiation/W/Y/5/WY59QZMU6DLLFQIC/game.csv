"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my needs.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your offer.  Let's try to bridge the gap and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I'm closer to your offer, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
