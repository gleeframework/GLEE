"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for it.  Let's find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for a quick and mutually beneficial deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,500, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  It's only $500 more than my previous offer, which should make it worthwhile for you. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'll offer the product to you for $14,250. This is the last concession I'm willing to make, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",14250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm sticking to my offer of $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider my other options.",13500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $13,500. I'll make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
