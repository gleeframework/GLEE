"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $9,500 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, suggesting a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's offer of $10,250 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Good Value:** While not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good value for Bob, saving him $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **Time Constraint:**  Negotiations are time-sensitive.  Accepting this offer secures the product and avoids further haggling that could risk losing the deal to John."
