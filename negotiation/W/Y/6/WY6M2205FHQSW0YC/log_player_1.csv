"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a strong offer of $950,000 sets a high anchor. While it's below Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the fairness of the offer, promoting a collaborative negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By opening high, Alice establishes a strong position for subsequent rounds. She can gradually decrease her price if needed, but always with the backup option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, Alice knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for a price this low. By rejecting and countering, Alice can gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to her desired price range. She still has the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm confident that this product offers even more potential than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 910000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Justification:** Alice makes a significant concession from her initial price ($950,000 to $910,000), showing flexibility. However, she justifies the higher price by re-emphasizing the product's untapped potential and value. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price point closer to the midpoint between their previous offers, Alice appeals to a common negotiation tactic and encourages a sense of fairness. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While willing to negotiate, Alice remains above the $850,000 mark, demonstrating her value assessment and leaving room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we try $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** Accepting Bob's offer of $900,000 yields a significant profit of $100,000 over Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. Alice has successfully moved him considerably from his initial offer of $850,000.
* **Time Value:** While there are more rounds, securing a deal now eliminates the risk of Bob reducing his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. 

Overall, $900,000 represents a very favorable outcome for Alice, balancing profit maximization with a realistic assessment of the negotiation dynamics."
