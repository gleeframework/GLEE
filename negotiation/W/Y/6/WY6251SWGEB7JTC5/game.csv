"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, while still ensuring I achieve a fair return. I believe this is a price that's reasonable for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
