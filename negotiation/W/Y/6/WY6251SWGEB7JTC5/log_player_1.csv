"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  I'm confident you'll see the incredible potential it holds for your business.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) knowing that Bob values it at $800,000. This gives me a lot of room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the ""true value"" of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer, even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to establish a strong initial position and set the stage for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $100,000 more, but I'm not willing to give up just yet.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, while still ensuring I achieve a fair return. I believe this is a price that's reasonable for both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Realistic Price:**  I'm countering with $1,700,000, which is closer to my minimum and closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not to a point where I'm losing too much.
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to show Bob I'm flexible. 
* **Focus on Shared Benefit:**  I frame it as a price that is ""reasonable for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation. 
* **Open to Continued Negotiation:** The final sentence keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I can get a higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum and secures the sale."
