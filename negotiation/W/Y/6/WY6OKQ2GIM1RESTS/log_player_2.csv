"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, it is the most financially sensible choice to ""BuyFromJhon"" and avoid further negotiation."
