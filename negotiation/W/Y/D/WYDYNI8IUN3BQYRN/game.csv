"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering my budget and the market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1,050,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to recoup a reasonable amount. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
