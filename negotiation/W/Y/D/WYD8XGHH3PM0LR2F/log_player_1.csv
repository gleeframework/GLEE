Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well above your valuation and leaves room for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
