"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well above your valuation and leaves room for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $900,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
