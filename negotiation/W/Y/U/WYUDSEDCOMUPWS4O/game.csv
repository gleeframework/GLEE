"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. I could come down to $1,120,000. This is my final offer.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
