"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than what John is asking.
* **The offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so Alice's offer is within your price range.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000."
