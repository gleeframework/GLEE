Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $150, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This sets a high starting point for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message implies I'm open to discussing the price, which could lead to a counteroffer from Bob. 

**Strategy:** 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings by:

* **Setting a high initial price:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher final price. 
* **Being open to counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation alive and prevents Bob from immediately walking away.
* **Having John as a backup:** Knowing I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum price gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. 
* **I have a backup buyer:** I can sell to John for $150, which gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain my bargaining position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate and willing to wait for a better deal.
* **Increase the chances of a higher price:** Continuing the negotiation gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a price closer to my desired $150.
* **Utilize John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me confidence to hold firm during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $120 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $140 represents a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Agreement:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to accept my counteroffer, while still keeping the negotiation active.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Move Closer to My Target:** I'm trying to get closer to my desired $150 price while still being realistic about Bob's budget.
* **Keep the Negotiation Moving:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to compromise and that I'm serious about selling the product to him.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm keeping my options open to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a guaranteed alternative:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, providing me with a certain and more profitable outcome.
* **Negotiation risks:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a prolonged process, and there's no guarantee that he'll eventually meet my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a prolonged process. It's a smart move to maximize my earnings and minimize risk."
