"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I believe the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,225,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your offer is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
