"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you're interested in the product. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,350,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This demonstrates my flexibility while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's find a way to make this happen.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
