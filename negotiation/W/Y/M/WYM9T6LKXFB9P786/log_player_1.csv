Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for us to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm explicitly stating I'm willing to work with Bob, which suggests I'm open to a deal. 
* **Not going too high:** While $1,500,000 would be the ideal outcome, pushing for it risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  By having John as a backup, I have a safety net.  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always fall back on John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can:

* **Test his commitment:**  If he's serious about buying the product, he'll likely counter again, giving me a chance to negotiate.
* **Potentially push for a higher price:** He may be willing to budge a bit more to secure the deal.
* **Maintain control:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and maintains leverage.

**Important:** While John is a safety net, I'm not rushing to sell to him yet. It's still worth exploring a better offer with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you're interested in the product. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $1,350,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This demonstrates my flexibility while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm not accepting his offer immediately, indicating I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's proposal. This demonstrates flexibility without appearing desperate.
* **Positive language:**  Using phrases like ""I appreciate your offer"" and ""Let's find a way to make this happen"" keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

**Key takeaway:**  By striking a balance between firmness and flexibility, I aim to achieve a better outcome than John's offer while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $1,360,000. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result.  Considering:

* **John's offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but Bob's offer is significantly better.
* **The risk of further negotiation:**  Pushing for a higher price risks Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **The potential for future deals:**  Building a good relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities, making a deal now worthwhile.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision.  It secures a good price while preserving a potential relationship with a valuable customer."
