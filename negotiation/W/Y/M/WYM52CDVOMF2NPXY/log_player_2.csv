"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $100 from John.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($100).  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice to save money."
