"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and you can buy it from John for that price.
* Alice is offering it for $110, which is better than John's price, but still more than you're willing to pay.
* You're trying to save money, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will still get you the product at a price within your budget."
