"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to my minimum.  There are still 8 rounds remaining.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $150 is an option, I'm not yet ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-proposal that's still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a significant loss.
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, making the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counter-offer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $150, giving me a good margin and room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to consider $130 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **More Negotiation Time:** There are still 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to continue negotiating.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob seems willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm not ready to settle for $150 yet. I might be able to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $145 to $140. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrates that I'm not giving in easily.
* **Fairness Argument:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight that my counter-offer is a win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I have time to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable going above $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer has increased to $135, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Time to Push:**  We're halfway through the negotiation process, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $150 is a safe option, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference once more, and I'll accept $137.50. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession, bringing my price down to $137.50. This shows I'm committed to finding a compromise but also emphasizes that I still have room to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Compromise:** I'm framing my counter-offer as a final compromise to encourage Bob to close the deal. 
* **Closing the Deal:** With only three rounds left, I'm looking to finalize the deal before considering selling to John.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum price of $150, so I'm not losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer. How about $135.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds remaining.  
* **Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Risk of Lower Offers:**  With limited rounds left, there's a risk that Bob might make lower offers in future rounds, potentially pushing the price further below my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. It eliminates the risk of getting a worse deal with Bob.

**Conclusion:** It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
