"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500 for the product. Can we discuss the details further?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair compromise and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's work towards a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,5,
