"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still a good value for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  You can do better by rejecting and seeing if Alice will counter with a lower price, or going with John's offer."
