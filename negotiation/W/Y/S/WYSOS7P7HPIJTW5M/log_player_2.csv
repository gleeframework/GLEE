"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $95.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, it's still more than what the product is worth to you ($100). There's room for negotiation, and you can try to get a better price by rejecting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  The counteroffer of $85 is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what the product is worth to her ($80).
* **Fair Offer:** $85 represents a fair compromise. It shows you are serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice may reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $85.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Your Value:**  $90 is still over what the product is worth to you ($100). 
* **Room for Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your price point, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting, you can continue to try and lower the price. 

You can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation, and $90 isn't a significant enough jump to make it worth accepting at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a clear compromise, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement. It's halfway between Alice's latest offer ($90) and your previous counteroffer ($85).
* **Stronger Position:**  You've established that you're willing to pay more than $85, putting you in a stronger position to negotiate.
* **Still Under Value:** $87.50 is still within your budget, so you're not taking a significant risk. 

This counteroffer gives Alice an opportunity to accept a price that is closer to what she wants while still offering you a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  How about $88.  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Value:**  $88 is only $8 over what the product is worth to you. 
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation may be fruitless.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If you reject this offer, you risk Alice walking away, leaving you with the option of buying from John at $100.

Considering the potential risk of losing the deal and the relatively small difference in price, it's best to accept Alice's offer at this point."
