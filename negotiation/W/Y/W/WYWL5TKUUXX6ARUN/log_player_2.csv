"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you. Considering its worth, I propose an initial offer of $750,000 for the product. This is a generous offer, aiming to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's $50,000 below your maximum, but you can likely do better.
* **There's no harm in negotiating.** You have nothing to lose by trying to get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposition of $725,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value I believe the product holds and the considerations you've presented. I hope this suggestion will facilitate a satisfactory agreement for both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to your desired price.** It's only $25,000 above your last offer, and you're already saving $75,000 compared to John.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the time.** The potential savings are small, and continuing to negotiate could risk Alice backing out or you losing out to another buyer.
* **It's a good deal.** You're getting a quality product for a decent price."
