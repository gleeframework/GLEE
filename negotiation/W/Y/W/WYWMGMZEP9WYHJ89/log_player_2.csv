"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $140 is still above your desired price range.  Let's see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$135 is within your budget and a good compromise. You're saving $15 compared to John's price, and you've avoided further rounds of negotiation."
