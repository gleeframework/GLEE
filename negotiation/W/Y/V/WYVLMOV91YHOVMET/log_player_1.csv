Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, so he doesn't know your absolute bottom line.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of Bob's potential profit as possible without pushing him away. Offering a price closer to $1,200,000 increases your potential earnings but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps the tone positive and emphasizes the product's value.
* **The Price ($1,150,000):**
    * This allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of Bob's potential profit.
    * Leaves Bob with a still-attractive potential profit of $50,000.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate to secure the deal.
* **Relationship:** Consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important for future dealings. If so, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price to foster that relationship."
