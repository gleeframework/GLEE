{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know you can buy the product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you can see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and creates room for a potential middle ground.  I'm also aware that I can always walk away and buy from John, so I have leverage in this negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. There are still 7 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good deal. I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in closing the deal, as we're getting closer to a potential agreement."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $25,000 more than my last offer. This is a good deal considering I can always buy from John for $1,200,000.  I'm confident that further negotiation may not yield a significantly better result, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds."
