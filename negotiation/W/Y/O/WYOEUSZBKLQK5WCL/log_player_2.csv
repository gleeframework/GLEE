"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,100,000**. This is better than John's price of $1,200,000, but you can do better.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible**. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice.** 

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, which might incentivize Alice to lower her price."
