Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, making it more enticing for Bob. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, other offers within the range of $800,000 - $1,200,000 could be considered."
