"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $90 is cheaper than buying from John for $100.
* Even though the product is only worth $80 to Alice, it's worth $100 to you.  This means you're still getting a good deal by accepting Alice's offer."
