"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product, especially considering the benefits it offers your specific business, is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
