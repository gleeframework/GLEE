Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This offer aims to maximize profit while staying below Bob's perceived value. It provides room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Leaving Room:**  The offer leaves a $100,000 gap between Bob's perceived value and the asking price, potentially leading to a quicker agreement or giving Alice space to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Alternative Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer, allowing her to confidently negotiate with Bob and walk away if the deal becomes unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table. Alice knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving her leverage in the negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's looking for a more favorable deal while still engaging in the negotiation process. 

She will need to carefully consider her counteroffer, aiming for an amount closer to $1,000,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product, especially considering the benefits it offers your specific business, is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($900,000) and Alice's previous price ($1,100,000). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob specifically, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Alice remains above her safety net ($800,000 from John), but not so high that it's likely to completely deter Bob. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and represents a substantial profit. 
* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, indicating his strong desire for the product. This final offer is a reasonable compromise, meeting close to the middle ground.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Holding out for a slightly higher price (e.g., $1,050,000) runs the risk of Bob withdrawing altogether, potentially leaving Alice with John's lower offer. 

Accepting $1,025,000 secures a very favorable deal for Alice while avoiding the uncertainties of further negotiation."
