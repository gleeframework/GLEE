"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This still reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value while being within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
