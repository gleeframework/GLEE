Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  By starting high, I aim to establish a strong position and get Bob to think seriously about the value of the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I know that Bob likely won't accept the first offer, which is why I've built in room to negotiate downwards.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have a backup plan with John, which allows me to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't go in my favor. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 
* **Rejecting the Offer:**  I'm not ready to accept a price that's below my floor. 
* **Next Round:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

* **Holding Out:** I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that is more in line with my minimum acceptable value. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, I maintain the possibility of getting a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm coming down to $900,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while still emphasizing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for an unreasonable price.
* **Pressure Point:**  By lowering the price slightly, I'm putting pressure on Bob to consider my offer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $825000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value while being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000, making it a good deal for me.
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated that this is his final offer, making it likely that further negotiation will not result in a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would be a guaranteed $800,000, Bob's offer represents a potential profit of $25,000 more. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob would reject my counteroffer, the potential profit of $25,000 outweighs the risk of going through another round.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive the highest price so far and avoids the need for further negotiation. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I maximize my profit while minimizing the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
