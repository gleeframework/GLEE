"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits you stand to gain.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I could consider coming down to $880,000. This still reflects a considerable discount while acknowledging the product's worth.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $880,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your offer, the product's value is significantly higher than $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $815,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $780,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",780000.0,Bob,6,
