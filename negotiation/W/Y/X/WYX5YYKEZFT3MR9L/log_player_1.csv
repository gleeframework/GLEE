Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $80, so offering $110 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $120, so $110 gives you some wiggle room.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** You're not asking for the full value upfront, which could make Bob more likely to engage.

By offering $110, you create a scenario where:

* Bob might accept, leading to a quick sale and a good profit.
* Bob might counteroffer, giving you a chance to further negotiate.
* If the negotiation doesn't work, you can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below your minimum value of $120 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for you.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, his message indicates interest in the product. This gives you an opportunity to counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can sell to John for $120 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. If the counteroffers don't work out, you can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, showing Bob you're not stuck on your original price. 
* **Reasonable price:**  $95 is still above your minimum value of $120 and is closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message highlights the product's value, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'd be gaining.

By making this counteroffer, you are:

* **Maintaining leverage:**  You're not accepting Bob's initial offer, signaling you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows you to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay more.
* **Keeping the door open:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
