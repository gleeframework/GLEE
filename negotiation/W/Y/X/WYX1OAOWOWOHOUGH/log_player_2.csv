"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to start the negotiation and see if we can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget of around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but leaves room for us to meet in the middle.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this deal work. This price reflects the product's value and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but we're still not at my ideal budget. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at that price?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're strategically moving closer to our target of $12,000 without accepting John's offer yet.  It's a balance - we need to show Alice we're willing to negotiate but also hold firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This way we both get a fair deal and can close this transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our budget, and further negotiation might not yield much better results.  This seems like a fair compromise, and we can secure the product for a price better than John's offer."
