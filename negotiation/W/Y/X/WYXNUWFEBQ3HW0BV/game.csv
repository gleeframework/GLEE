"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a little ways off. Could we try something around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
