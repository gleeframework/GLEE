"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",775000.0,Alice,5,
