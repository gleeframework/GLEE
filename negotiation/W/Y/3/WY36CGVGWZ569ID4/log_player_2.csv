"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $775,000, and this price is already a significant saving compared to her initial offer and John's price. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk Alice increasing the price or the negotiation breaking down."
