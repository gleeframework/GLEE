Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn above your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the chances of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value. Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Product Price:**  $1,450,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making the offer attractive. Meanwhile, you secure a $250,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to adjust your strategy based on his response."
