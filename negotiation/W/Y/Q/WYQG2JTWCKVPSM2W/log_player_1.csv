"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this encourages him to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm hoping to get a better price, but I'm also aware that I might need to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.  I believe this price is still fair, and I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to raise his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. I have four rounds left and might be able to negotiate a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.  With only three rounds remaining, I need to be careful not to lose this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision. While I'm close to my minimum price, I only have two rounds left.  It's likely Bob won't increase his offer enough to make it worthwhile, especially since he's been pretty firm on his pricing.  I'd rather secure the $1,500,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
