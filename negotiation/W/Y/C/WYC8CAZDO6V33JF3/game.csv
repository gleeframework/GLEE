"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, given the value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time and have other potential buyers interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,
