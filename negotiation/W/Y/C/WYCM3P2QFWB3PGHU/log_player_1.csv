"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value ($12,000).  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. I have 8 rounds left, which gives me enough time to potentially improve the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9000.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still potential to negotiate further. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $10,000 before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at $9200. This price is still fair for you, considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to purchase it comfortably. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is still below my minimum value, it's getting very close to my desired range. We're in the final stages of negotiation, and with only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers. 

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale that's within a reasonable distance of my desired price, while also preventing the risk of losing out to John or ending up with a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
