I'm rejecting Bob's counteroffer. While $9,000 is close to my ideal price, I still think I can get a little more. I'll see if I can push him higher in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,100 is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  It's time to secure this deal."
