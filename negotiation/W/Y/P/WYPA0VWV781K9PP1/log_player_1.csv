"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and potentially encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm suggesting the product is ""worth a lot to me"" to subtly imply its value without revealing my actual minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm still willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I still value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $125 is still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $112.50.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $120. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can push Bob up to my minimum or even a slightly higher price.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $120 if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. $112.50 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to go down a little further. How about we settle on $115? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a small compromise by lowering my price slightly. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on ""Good Deal"":** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer remains above my minimum of $120, ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm happy to see you're coming down in price, $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If that works for you, let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $120.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 6, and I'm starting to run out of time to negotiate. 
* **Guarantee with John:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit. I'm not confident I can push Bob any higher in the remaining rounds. 

While I'd prefer to get more than $120, the risk of failing to close a deal with Bob and being left with nothing is too high. Selling to John ensures a safe and immediate transaction."
