"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your firmness, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my budget. $815000 is a good offer, but I'm only able to go up to $790000 right now. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,
