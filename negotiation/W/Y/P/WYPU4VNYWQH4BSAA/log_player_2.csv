"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds and the alternative price is $1,200,000,  it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and am not just playing games. However, I'm still within a reasonable range, considering the alternative price of $1,200,000. This counteroffer should encourage further discussion and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $825000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, which is a good sign.  However, $825,000 is still above my target of $750,000. I have several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground.  By offering $800,000, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm taking Alice's offers seriously and working towards a mutually beneficial solution.  This should encourage her to come down a bit further and hopefully lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $815,000, which is closer to my target price of $750,000, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal. I have five rounds left, and the alternative price from John is $1,200,000. I still see room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly higher than my goal.  I will try to make another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your firmness, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my budget. $815,000 is a good offer, but I'm only able to go up to $790,000 right now. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $750,000 to $790,000, showing that I am willing to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to accept or make a final, small concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $790000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $810000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my target price, but it's still above my desired range. I'm not willing to accept a price significantly higher than my goal, and I have three rounds left to potentially secure a better deal.  The alternative price from John is $1,200,000, so I can still afford to be patient and try to push for a lower price. I'll make one more counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $810,000 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $800,000.  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at this price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $800,000, which is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows that I'm taking her offers seriously and am trying to reach a mutually agreeable price.  With only two rounds left, I believe this counteroffer will push Alice to make a final decision, either accepting the offer or making a small concession to meet me at $800,000."
