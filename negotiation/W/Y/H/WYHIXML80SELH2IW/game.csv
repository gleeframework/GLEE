"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $115? This is a good price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. ",115.0,Alice,5,
