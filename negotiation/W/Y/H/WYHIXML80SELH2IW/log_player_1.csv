I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $100 is too low for me, and I still have more negotiating rounds available."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob is persistent with his $110 offer, and while I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure I'll get a better price. John is a safe bet, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
