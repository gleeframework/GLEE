"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to let you have it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I think $140 is still a fair price for this great product. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, and $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the deal entirely."
