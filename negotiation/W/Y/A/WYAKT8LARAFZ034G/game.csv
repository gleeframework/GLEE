"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $750000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can finalize a deal!",825000.0,Bob,4,
