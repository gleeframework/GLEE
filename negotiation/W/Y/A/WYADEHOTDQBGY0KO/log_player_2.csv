"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think $1,100,000 is too high, and I'm hoping to negotiate a better price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be open to $1,037,500? I believe this represents a small concession on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not getting any closer to the price I'm comfortable with. $1,037,500 is still too high, and I'm starting to think that Alice is not willing to budge much further. I'd rather not go back and forth anymore and risk ending up with a price that's not in my best interest. I think I've made a reasonable offer at $1,025,000, and Alice's counteroffers have been incremental but not substantial enough to justify the price.

I'll choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.
