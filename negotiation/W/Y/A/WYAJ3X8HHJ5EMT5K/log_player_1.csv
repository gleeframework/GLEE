Send your offer to Bob.,"```
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's a potential profit margin if we price it below that. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to aim higher with Bob."
