"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a fair deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $9,200. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,200, but I'm still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $8,950?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product.",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the deadline, and I'd like to make a strong push to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,950, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,100 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again, and I'll offer you $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not reaching a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'll make one final offer: $9,050. This is as low as I can go, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",9050.0,Alice,9,
