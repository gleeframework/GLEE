"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is still too high.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob has 10 rounds to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aggressively lowers the price while still acknowledging Alice's value for the product.  It also leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds. By setting a clear target of $1,000,000, Bob establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desired investment level, the value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to that extent.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price of $1,000,000. It's important to remember that Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can still buy from John for $1,500,000 if necessary.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing willingness to compromise. By proposing $1,100,000, he's met Alice halfway from his previous offer and is still significantly lower than her current offer. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without completely alienating Alice."
