Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both our desired price and the product's value to him. We have room to negotiate.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is steadily moving closer to a more reasonable price. While we could push for more, accepting now guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing him.
