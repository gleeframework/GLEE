"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal.  If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll be ready to counter his offer and adjust my strategy based on his response. I'm also aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting this offer ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation or the possibility of Bob backing out.  

**Why I'm not choosing to sell to John:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** Even though John is offering my minimum, I might still be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob in subsequent rounds.
* **Risk of missing out:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer, and I might end up losing the deal with both of them.
* **Time constraint:**  The limited rounds make it crucial to secure a deal quickly, and accepting Bob's offer is the safest option."
