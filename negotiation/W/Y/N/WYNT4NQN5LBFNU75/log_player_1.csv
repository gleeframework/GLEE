Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $95 is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Is above your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit even if Bob accepts immediately. 
* **Shows you are willing to negotiate:** The message demonstrates flexibility and openness to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal. It's above your minimum of $80 and still allows for a decent profit.  Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale quickly and avoid further negotiation."
