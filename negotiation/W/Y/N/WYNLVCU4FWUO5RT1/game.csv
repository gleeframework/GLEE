"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider my offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,375. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10375.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $10,337.50.  This gives us both a little bit of what we want, and we can finally close this deal.",10337.5,Alice,7,
