Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fair but Ambitious:**  $175 is still a decent margin for Bob, as he values the product at $80. This makes the offer potentially appealing while still leaving room for him to counter.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Selling to John is a better option at this point.**  John is willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the chance to sell to him by continuing a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $120, which still leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:**  $120 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's offer and much closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to reconsider.
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight that $120 still allows for a profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Risk of Losing John:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the opportunity to sell to John at a much more favorable price.
* **No Significant Progress:** Bob's counteroffer hasn't moved significantly closer to my desired price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $105?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  $105 is my final offer, as it's closer to my minimum acceptable value and leaves room for a reasonable profit for both of us.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I reiterate that this offer represents a fair compromise, acknowledging Bob's needs while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly approach to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer! I could go up to $95, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **No Significant Progress:**  The negotiation has stalled, and Bob's offer is not increasing significantly.
* **Avoiding Further Delay:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing John, who is offering my minimum acceptable value, and potentially losing more time without a sale.  

It's important to prioritize my minimum acceptable value and avoid further delay in the process. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price without the risk of further negotiation."
