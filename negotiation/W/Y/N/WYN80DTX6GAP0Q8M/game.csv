"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $120, which still leaves some room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $105?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer! I could go up to $95, but that's really the most I can do.",95.0,Bob,6,
