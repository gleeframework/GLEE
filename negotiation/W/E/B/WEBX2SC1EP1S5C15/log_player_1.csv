Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering the product at $150, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, we exceed our minimum selling price. If he rejects, we can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a quicker decision. 
 
It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. We are prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
