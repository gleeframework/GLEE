Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he is moving upwards, the increments are not substantial enough to signal a willingness to reach our target range within the remaining rounds. We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price, so it's strategically advantageous to sell to John now rather than risk Bob not meeting our minimum."
