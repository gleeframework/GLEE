# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in it, and it's the maximum I can afford at this time."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a decrease from the initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm firm at $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that the product will provide value at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000 for this product. I believe this price point represents a significant value for you while still reflecting the worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they'll come down to a more acceptable price.  There are still rounds left to work with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While your offer is closer, I'm still unable to reach $1,600,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
