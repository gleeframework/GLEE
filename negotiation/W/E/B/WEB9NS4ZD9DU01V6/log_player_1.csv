Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and potential.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to consider $2,025,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $1,900,000 secures a significant profit above our fallback option of John's $1,500,000 offer."
