Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'd be getting. 

**Strategy:**

* This strategy aims to find a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's maximum value. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's willing to pay closer to my minimum, I might accept. If he's too low, I'll counter, or potentially end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and make a counteroffer closer to $10,000. This will signal that I'm serious about getting a better price.
*  I'll keep John as a backup option. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can sell to John for my minimum price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? That's a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,750, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my appreciation for Bob's willingness to negotiate and emphasizing that this offer is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is designed to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll get a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider making a final counteroffer or potentially going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $9,600 as my counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price of $9,750. Considering that John is offering me my minimum of $12,000, accepting Bob's offer is a good compromise. It allows me to sell the product quickly and for a price that's still within my acceptable range.

**Strategy:**

* While I might have been able to squeeze out an extra $150 through further negotiation, the risk of Bob backing out or John changing his mind is high. 
* Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and allows me to move on quickly."
