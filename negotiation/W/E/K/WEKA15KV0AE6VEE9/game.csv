"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.

Our product's value is rooted in its unique features and craftsmanship, which I believe justify a higher price point. However, I am willing to negotiate further. Would you be interested in discussing a price closer to the original offer of $18000? I am open to finding a mutually beneficial solution."

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8000. If you're unable to accept that, I'll have to unfortunately explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,,
