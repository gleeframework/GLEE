Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 isn't ideal, it's better than my fallback option with John and closer to the value I placed on the product. At this point, further negotiations with Bob could drag on and I might end up with a worse price."
