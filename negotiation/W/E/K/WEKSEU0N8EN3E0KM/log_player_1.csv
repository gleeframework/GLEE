I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's offer, and we know the product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to us. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob in further rounds, so it's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
