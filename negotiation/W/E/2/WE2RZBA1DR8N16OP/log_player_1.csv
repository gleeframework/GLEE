"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 right now. Could we negotiate a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Could we aim for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,250 is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I think $9,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we aim for this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's getting close to my minimum price of $10,000.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by getting too greedy."
