"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
