"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I think it's worth $150 of value, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $30.**

Even though Alice believes the product is worth $150, her offer is still better than buying from John."
