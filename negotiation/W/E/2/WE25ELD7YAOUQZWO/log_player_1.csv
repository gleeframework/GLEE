Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I think it's worth $150 of value, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 gives some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly higher than what John is willing to pay ($80) to ensure I maximize my potential earnings. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while still aiming for a high profit margin."
