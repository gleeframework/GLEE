"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. Can you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $9,500, but that's my absolute maximum.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,500, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $12,500 to make it worth my while. Can you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, but I can't go any higher. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I still need to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a good compromise considering the product's value and my budget.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can go, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $11,250, which is the lowest I can sell the product for and still make a profit. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,9,
