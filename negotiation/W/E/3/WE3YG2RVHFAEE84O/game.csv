"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm only able to go as high as $800,000 at this time. This is a serious offer and reflects the value I see in your product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents the product's true value to me, I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects a significant adjustment on my end, demonstrating my desire to work with you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident this product has value, but I'm firmly capped at $1,000,000.  This is a serious offer and shows my commitment to working towards a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
