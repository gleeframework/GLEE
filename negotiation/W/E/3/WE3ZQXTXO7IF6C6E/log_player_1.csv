Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.  
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price of $19,000 gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the potential benefits. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a great profit of $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
