"Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. Let's discuss it further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1400000?  This price still allows for a good profit for me and a reasonable deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1400000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to move forward with this opportunity. Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm willing to go down to $1200000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1200000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  How about we settle at $1100000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us to both finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1100000 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  Let's meet halfway again.  How about $1150000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1150000 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched.  Let's try to meet in the middle again at $1100000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finally close this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
