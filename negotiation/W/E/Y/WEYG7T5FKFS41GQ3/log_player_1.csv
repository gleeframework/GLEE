Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer leaves some room for negotiation, but still allows me to get a significant profit while keeping Bob happy.  I'm starting with a high price, but I'm open to negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and consider selling to John if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
