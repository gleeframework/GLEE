"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  However, I'm aware of John's offer and I'm willing to negotiate within reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal. Selling to John is still an option, but I'm confident that this is the best offer I'm likely to get from Bob."
