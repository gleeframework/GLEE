Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob has one chance to accept; this makes him slightly more likely to agree to a higher price.

**The Offer Strategy**

The ideal offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($500,000) while ensuring Bob still sees a benefit in accepting.

Here's my suggested offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity Appeal:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and desirability.
* **Confidence in Value:** Mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" reinforces Bob's high valuation.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($350,000) of the value difference. Bob still benefits by paying $150,000 less than his perceived value.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but stay firm on not going below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John, implying you have other interested buyers can sometimes create a sense of urgency, but be careful not to appear disingenuous."
