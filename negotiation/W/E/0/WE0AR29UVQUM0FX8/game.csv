"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's even better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit more. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.
