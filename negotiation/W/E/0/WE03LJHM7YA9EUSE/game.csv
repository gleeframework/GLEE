"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I believe I can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we aim for $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $125. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, how about we settle at $110? This would allow us to reach a compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $120. I think this is the best we can do to meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous discussions, and I'd like to propose $115 as the final price for the product. This seems like a fair compromise between our respective positions.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $115 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'll counteroffer at $125. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,7,
