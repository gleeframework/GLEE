Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $825,000.  It's not worth further negotiation as you have a guaranteed option for $800,000 with John."
