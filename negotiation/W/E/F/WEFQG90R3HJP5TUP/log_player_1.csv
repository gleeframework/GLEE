Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a little less.  I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is slightly better than the previous one, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,250,000,  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price. I'll accept Bob's offer."
