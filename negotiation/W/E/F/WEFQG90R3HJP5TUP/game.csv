"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
