"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works. I'm starting with $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a little less.  I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes his desire for a lower price and leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so this offer leaves some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for this. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  However, it's closer to his target price than the initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's serious about buying the product.  However, he's still staying below his maximum budget and leaving room for Alice to make a concession.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still slightly above his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go even lower. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but he's still staying within his budget.  He's only $25,000 away from his maximum price, demonstrating his willingness to finalize the deal. By proposing a ""fair compromise,"" Bob is appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially pushing her to make a final concession."
