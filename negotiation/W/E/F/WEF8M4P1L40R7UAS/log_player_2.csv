"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below the value you've placed on the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob the product at a reasonable price."
