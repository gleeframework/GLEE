"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you consider $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still below the value you've placed on the product.  Let's make a deal!",10000.0,Alice,3,
