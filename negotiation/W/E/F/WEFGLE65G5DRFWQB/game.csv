"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to try to accommodate you while still ensuring a fair deal for me. My counteroffer is $102.50. This allows us to stay closer to your suggested price while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $102.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $98.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be a fair deal for both of us.",98.5,Bob,4,
