Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a decent discount while still leaving me plenty of room to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get at least $9,000 from Bob, and if not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $10,500 to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $9,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my desired price range. I'm comfortable accepting this offer, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000, and it represents a fair compromise with Bob."
