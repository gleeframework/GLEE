"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would give us both a fair deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $9,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
