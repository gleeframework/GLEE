"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This is a significant investment for you, but the product's value will definitely be worth it in the long run."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and it's a good deal considering the remaining rounds. It's also a good compromise and shows that Bob is serious about buying the product.  I'm going to accept his offer."
