"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $13,000. I believe this price reflects the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still leaves room for negotiation.**  You want to try to get the price lower. 
* **There's no guarantee Alice will accept your counteroffer.** However, even if she doesn't, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, but it's still above her minimum value ($8,000). 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the offer, suggesting you've considered the value and are making a fair proposal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this counteroffer, you can still adjust your offer further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  However, I can't go lower than $12,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly better than John's.**  You're getting a good deal at $12,000.
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.**  You've already lowered the price, and Alice is firm on her counteroffer.  There's a chance she could reject another counteroffer, leaving you with John's higher price.
* **It's a good balance of saving money and minimizing risk.**  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price and avoids potential delays or further negotiation."
