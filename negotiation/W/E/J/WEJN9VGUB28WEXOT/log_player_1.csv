Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob.  I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counteroffer again. I'll also keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which I can use as a baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below what I want for the product. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still giving me some room to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's clear that we're not going to get any closer to my initial asking price. Accepting this offer guarantees me a $1,200,000 sale, which is significantly more than selling to John. This is a good outcome given the negotiation process."
