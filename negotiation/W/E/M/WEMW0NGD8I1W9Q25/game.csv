"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $1400000. This is my best counteroffer for now, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to offer $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
