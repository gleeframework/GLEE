"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  This product is useful to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think it's a bit high, but I have to make a living. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $700,000, which is a significant jump from my last offer.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
