"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9125.0,Bob,6,
