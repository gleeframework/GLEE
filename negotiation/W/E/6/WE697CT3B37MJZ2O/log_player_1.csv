{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $8,000, so $9,500 gives him some wiggle room.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're aiming for at least $10,000, but this gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my goal of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,125 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and it seems Bob is unlikely to budge further. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
