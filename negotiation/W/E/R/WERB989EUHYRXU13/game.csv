"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial situation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still represents a significant value proposition for you.  I'm confident this product will generate a strong return on your investment.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
