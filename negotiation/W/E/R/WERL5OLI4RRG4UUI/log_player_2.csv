"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially advantageous option."
