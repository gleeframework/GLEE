"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll be getting a valuable product at a good price, and I'll be able to move it quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good deal for her, it's still above my maximum budget.  I need to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to bring the price closer to my budget.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $900,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this and make it happen!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is within my budget and closer to my desired price. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John for $800,000 is too high. This offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
