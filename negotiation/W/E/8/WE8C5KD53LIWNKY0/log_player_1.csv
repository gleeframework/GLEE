"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as a potential win for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording ""starting point for discussions"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your perspective. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial proposed price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than our target and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to what we could potentially get from Bob.  We'll proceed to Round 3 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary considerations. While the product's value is undeniable, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We are moving closer to Bob's offer by a significant margin ($100,000), demonstrating our willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This phrasing suggests fairness and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Holding Ground:** We are still holding above both our minimum and the price John offers, aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer but is still trying to negotiate a better deal. We are still in a position to push for a higher price. We will reject this offer to signal that we're looking for a price closer to our previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this at $1,275,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minor Concession:** We're making a smaller concession ($25,000) this time to signal that we are reaching the upper limits of our flexibility.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""find a solution"" and ""commitment to reaching an agreement"" emphasize the desire to close the deal fairly.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We are aiming for a price slightly above the midpoint between his last offer and our previous counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad you're willing to compromise. Based on our previous negotiations, I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,260,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** $1,260,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin and providing a healthy profit. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" indicates this is likely his best price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of losing the deal altogether, while accepting secures a good profit now. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further counteroffers are unlikely to yield substantially better results and could lead to impasse."
