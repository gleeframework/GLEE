Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value ($14,000) gives him a sense of a potential deal while still leaving you space to potentially negotiate down a little if needed. 
* **Strong Alternative:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $10,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
