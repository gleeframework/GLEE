Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $140 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). While there's a chance he might accept immediately, it's more likely to prompt a counter-offer.
* **Close to John's Offer:** This offer keeps you close to your guaranteed sale price from John ($150). If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost much potential profit."
