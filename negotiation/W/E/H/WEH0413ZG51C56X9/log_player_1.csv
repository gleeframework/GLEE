"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $17,000, knowing that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I mention the value of the product, hoping to subtly highlight that the price is justified.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired $15,000.
* **John as Leverage:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a fallback option if Bob is unwilling to negotiate. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to make counteroffers and adjust my price based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but could you do it for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point, it's still above his perceived value of $10,000.  This suggests there is room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Accepting his offer now would be too low. It's better to hold out for a higher price, especially given my fallback option with John. 
* **Next Steps:**  By rejecting, I can make a counteroffer that reflects my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting keeps me in control of the negotiation and prevents selling to John too early. 
* **Counteroffer Preparation:**  I need to carefully consider my next counteroffer to find a middle ground that is both appealing to Bob and beneficial to me. 
* **Flexibility:**  I will continue to adjust my approach based on Bob's responses throughout the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price in the middle of my initial offer ($17,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($11,000). 
* **Reasoning:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" Bob is getting while highlighting the importance of finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By splitting the difference, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Seeking Agreement:**  This counteroffer aims to find a price point that is both acceptable to Bob and within my acceptable range. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm still mindful of John's $15,000 offer. This acts as a safety net in case Bob continues to reject my offers. 
* **Iterative Approach:** I'm prepared to continue adjusting my price based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $12,500? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I need to continue negotiating to try and secure a better price.  Accepting now would mean selling below my minimum.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* **Focus on Maximum Profit:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $12,500 is still below my minimum. 
* **Balancing Positions:**  I need to find a way to counter with a price that is attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to balance the need to negotiate effectively with the potential risk of running out of time."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,500 is getting closer, but I need to be at $13,500 to make this work for me. It's still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows us to meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum.  $13,500 represents a significant compromise for me, but it allows me to stay in the negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" Bob is still getting and highlights the middle ground we're trying to reach.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, it's important to show I'm willing to make concessions while still pushing for a profitable price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  By offering $13,500, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, I'll get a good price. But if he rejects, I have to decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation with limited time. 
* **Leverage the Clock:**  The remaining rounds add pressure to Bob, potentially making him more willing to compromise. 
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'll continue to adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I need to continue negotiating to try and secure a better price.  Accepting now would mean selling below my minimum.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.  

**Strategy:**

* **Focus on Maximum Profit:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $13,000 is still below my minimum. 
* **Balancing Positions:**  I need to find a way to counter with a price that is attractive to Bob while still being profitable for me. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to balance the need to negotiate effectively with the potential risk of running out of time. 
* **Assess Risk:**  Considering the number of rounds remaining and the potential offer from John, I need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for a guaranteed profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider my counteroffer. I need to find a price that is both attractive to Bob and profitable for me. I also need to consider the remaining time and the potential risk of losing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. To make this work, I need to be at $13,250.  This is a small difference, and it allows us to close the deal fairly.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is only $250 higher than Bob's final offer. It shows a genuine willingness to compromise and aims to be seen as a reasonable final step.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the small difference in price, highlighting it as a minor hurdle that can easily be overcome. The message also focuses on the positive outcome of closing the deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, this counteroffer is my last attempt to push for a higher price without risking losing the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Last Stand:** I'm taking a calculated risk by going for the final price I'm willing to accept. I'm banking on Bob being willing to close the deal rather than risk losing out on the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'm pushing for the best possible price, I'm also keeping in mind the potential of selling to John. If Bob rejects this offer, I have to decide whether to sell to John in the next round. 
* **Negotiation Conclusion:**  This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before making a final decision."
