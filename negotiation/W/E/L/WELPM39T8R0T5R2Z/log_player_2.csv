"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from other buyers, but still allows me a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still allow you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price for my product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding firm on getting a price that works for her.  At $975,000, we're getting a good deal compared to John's offer, and it's unlikely we can push Alice much lower.  Accepting now secures the product at a significant discount."
