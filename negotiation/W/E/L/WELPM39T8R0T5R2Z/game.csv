"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from other buyers, but still allows me a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me though.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would still allow you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price for my product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $925,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
