Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,200. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,900 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer and significantly better than selling to John. It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
