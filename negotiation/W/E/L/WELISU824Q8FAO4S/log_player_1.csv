"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $100.  Would you be interested in buying it for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $90. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), it's best to accept his offer and close the deal. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate, and it's not worth the risk considering I can get my minimum price from Bob."
