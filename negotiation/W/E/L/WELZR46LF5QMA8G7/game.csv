"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,000,000 for it. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we meet halfway at $1,875,000?",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're making progress. While your offer is tempting, the value this product brings to the table simply warrants a higher investment.  How about we settle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your budget constraints.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,700,000 is beyond my budget. I am willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
