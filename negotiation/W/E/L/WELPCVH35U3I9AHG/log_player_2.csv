{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  $12,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:** Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to save as much as possible.  $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:** Bob is raising his counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining within his budget.  It's a good balance between being assertive and showing flexibility."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  While $10,500 is close to Bob's maximum budget, he can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially save a bit more.  Remember, John is always an option if he can't secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:** Bob is now offering Alice's maximum price of $10,000. This shows a strong desire to close the deal while staying within his budget. Since John is willing to sell for the same price, this is a good time to see if Alice will accept. If she rejects, he can go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**  Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and Bob has already made a counteroffer at his maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice.  Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, which is the same as Bob's maximum price, it's best to buy from John.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation."
