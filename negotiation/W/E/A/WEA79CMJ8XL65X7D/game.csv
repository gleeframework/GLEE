"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's an interesting product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to come in lower, Bob. However, I have to consider my own bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1,600,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is just $50,000 more than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stick to my budget. I can't go higher than $1,500,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. ",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept it yet. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. How about $1,525,000? It's just $25,000 more than your final offer, and I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
