Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value is even higher for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value. This should encourage him to consider the offer, while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
