"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I can meet you in the middle at $165, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the bottom of my pricing range, Bob. I can do $154, but that's really as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure I want to sell it to you for any less than that. What do you think?",154.0,Alice,9,
