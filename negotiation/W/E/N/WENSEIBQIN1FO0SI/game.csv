"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while still being a fair price for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and should be closer to your desired price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
