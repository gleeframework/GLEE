Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also invites a response and keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Strategy:** By starting with a higher price, I can potentially secure a better deal while still being open to counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I can use John's offer as leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. 

* **Reasoning:** I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000, and I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Next Steps:**  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.

**My goal is to maximize my profit, and I think I can still get a better deal with Bob.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  That gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $1,300,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. I acknowledge Bob's offer, but I also reiterate my belief in the product's worth.
* **Strategy:** By making a counteroffer closer to my initial price, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit. 

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this counteroffer, as it's a good compromise and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 

* **Reasoning:** At this point, further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. There's a chance Bob will stick to his offer, and continuing could lead to a stalemate. It's also possible that John's offer could be withdrawn if negotiations with Bob drag on.  
* **Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer is the best option as it ensures a sale and a profit close to my minimum acceptable price.

**I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale with a reasonable profit over the risk of a prolonged negotiation.**"
