Alice's initial offer is far beyond my budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but it's still a significant amount over my budget. I'll keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm getting closer to my target price, but I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I have a few rounds left to see if we can strike a deal that works for both of us.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can convince Alice to come down further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and with only one round left, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal that works for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for my target price of $800,000. Although I'm not getting the best possible price, it's still a good deal for me and ensures I get the product I need."
