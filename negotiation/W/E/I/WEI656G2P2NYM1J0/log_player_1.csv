{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to that $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring Bob still sees a benefit in purchasing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $925,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines."
