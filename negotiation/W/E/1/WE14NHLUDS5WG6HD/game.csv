"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I really value your product, but I'm still committed to staying within my budget of $10,000. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,6,
