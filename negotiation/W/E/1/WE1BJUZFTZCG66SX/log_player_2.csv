"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $6,500. Let me know if this price works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) than Alice's asking price ($9,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Professional:**  My message maintains a polite and professional tone, which is important for a successful negotiation. I acknowledge Alice's offer and express my interest in the product.
* **Clear Intention:** I clearly state my willingness to purchase at my proposed price, encouraging Alice to consider my counteroffer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $6,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
