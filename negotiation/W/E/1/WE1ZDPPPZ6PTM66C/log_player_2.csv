"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice offers the product at your maximum price, there's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price. You have a backup option with John, so you hold a slightly stronger position."
