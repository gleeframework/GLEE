,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me. How about $1550000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
