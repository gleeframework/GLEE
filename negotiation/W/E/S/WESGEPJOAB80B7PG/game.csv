"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",9500.0,Alice,5,
