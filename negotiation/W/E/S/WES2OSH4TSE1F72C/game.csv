"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but my ownership comes with inherent advantages that justify a higher price.  How about we settle at $2,000,000? This reflects a willingness to find common ground while acknowledging the product's true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has inherent advantages, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,800,000 is still too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,900,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this offer?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
