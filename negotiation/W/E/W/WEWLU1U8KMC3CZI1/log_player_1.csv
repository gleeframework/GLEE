{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation without you feeling pressured to sell for less than your desired minimum.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This incentivizes Bob to accept the offer, as he's still getting a good deal.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** This shows you're serious about selling and helps guide the negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $820,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $860,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}
