"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $820,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $860,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal.",860000.0,Alice,3,
