"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $950,000. This is a serious offer, reflecting my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we agree on $725,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
