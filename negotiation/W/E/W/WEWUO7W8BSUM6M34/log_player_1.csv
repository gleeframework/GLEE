"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.  I believe he will likely counteroffer, and we can then work towards a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,500. This is halfway between my desired price and Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer, as it's still a good deal for him considering the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000 just yet. I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,250.  This is a small concession from my last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob, as it's still a very good deal for him.  I'm also getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm confident that I can reach an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob is still not willing to meet my desired price point. I've made several concessions, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's favorable to me. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as the time is running out."
