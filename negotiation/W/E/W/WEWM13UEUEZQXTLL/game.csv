"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we've been dancing around the price for a while now, Bob. I'm starting to think that $1,000,000 is a fair price, but I'm not ready to give it away just yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,005,000? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway",1005000.0,Alice,7,
