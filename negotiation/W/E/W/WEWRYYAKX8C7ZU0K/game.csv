"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  It's below my minimum value for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  That way, we both walk away with a good deal. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750? I'm eager to make a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,250 as a final compromise.  This would give me some room to cover my costs, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further.  How about $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
