Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  It's below my minimum value for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  That way, we both walk away with a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750? I'm eager to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,250 as a final compromise.  This would give me some room to cover my costs, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further.  How about $8,000? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is finally at my minimum value.  It's not ideal, but it's a decent deal considering we are close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price than what I could get from Bob."
