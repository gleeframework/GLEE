Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's significantly lower than what I need to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, but we still have a bit of a gap to bridge.

Let's work together to finalize this transaction.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,600,000 is closer to my goal, it's still not within my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.

I'm hopeful we can finalize this transaction with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a substantial compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the product's value while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her offer to $1,400,000, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit.  The negotiation has reached a point where you need to make a decisive choice. 

Given that you have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to exercise this option.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of further deadlock or that you might ultimately have to accept a price that's still higher than your preferred limit.

Therefore, the most prudent move at this point is to accept John's offer and buy the product for $800,000. You save $600,000 compared to Alice's final offer, ensuring you achieve your goal of getting the product within your budget."
