"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Reasonable margin:** The price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still potential to negotiate a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in a position of power and allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable margin:** $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's close enough to potentially be acceptable.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm serious about this purchase, and I believe this is a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for improvement:** There's still potential for negotiation and to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in a position of power and allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,150,000 just isn't enough for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant value for you considering the potential of this product. Let's meet halfway. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a lower price than my previous counteroffer.
* **Maintain a reasonable margin:** $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value and leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Frame it positively:** I'm using language like ""meet halfway"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired value, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds left, I want to avoid selling too low and potentially regretting the deal later.
* **Potential for better offer:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's potential.  This is my final offer, as we're running out of time.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm offering a lower price, but still above my minimum acceptable value, showing I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Time constraint:**  I'm emphasizing the limited rounds left to create a sense of urgency and pressure Bob to accept a deal.
* **Final offer:**  I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, putting the ball in Bob's court.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, the deal is closed.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make a final concession or sell the product to John in the next round."
