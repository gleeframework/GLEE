"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me to consider. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I'm serious about this purchase, and I believe this is a fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,150,000 just isn't enough for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant value for you considering the potential of this product. Let's meet halfway. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $1,200,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping you'll consider it seriously.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the product's potential.  This is my final offer, as we're running out of time.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
