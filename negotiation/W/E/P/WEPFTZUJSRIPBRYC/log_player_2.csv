"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,100,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product at $800,000, which is within your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or buy directly from John and save a substantial amount of money."
