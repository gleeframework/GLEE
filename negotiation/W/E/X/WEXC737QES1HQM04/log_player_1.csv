"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for potential compromise if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I believe Bob is willing to pay more, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be a good compromise that encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer. I've already made a concession and am unlikely to get a better deal from him. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob that might result in no sale."
