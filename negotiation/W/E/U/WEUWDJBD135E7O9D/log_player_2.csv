"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating towards a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Let's try $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,250.  This is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting close to his maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking a higher price from John or further negotiation with Alice that could lead to a higher price."
