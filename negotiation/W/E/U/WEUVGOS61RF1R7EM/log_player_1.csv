**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Bob will reach a price point that surpasses John's offer in a reasonable number of rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
