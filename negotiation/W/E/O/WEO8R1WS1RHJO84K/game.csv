"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $87.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go to $86, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  What do you say?",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, Bob. I can offer you the product for $88. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",88.0,Alice,5,
