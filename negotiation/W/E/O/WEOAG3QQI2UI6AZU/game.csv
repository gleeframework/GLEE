,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product has unique features that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1000000. This is a fair price given the potential value you'll gain from it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than what I feel is a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $975000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, which is a bit closer to your original offer. Can you consider this compromise?",960000.0,Bob,6,
