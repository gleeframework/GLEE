"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial proposal.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,175,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. This represents a substantial discount for you, and a price I'm comfortable with. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle â€“ $1,100,000, and we have a deal? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This represents a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
