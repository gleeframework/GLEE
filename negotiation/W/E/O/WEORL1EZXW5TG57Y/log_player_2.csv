"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is still above my target price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate since Alice values the product at $800,000. 
* **Exploring other options:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

``` 

**Reasoning:**
