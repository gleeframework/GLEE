This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
