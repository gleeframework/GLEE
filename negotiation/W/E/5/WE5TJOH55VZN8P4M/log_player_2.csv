"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still quite high considering the product is worth $80 to Alice. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a decent profit for Alice and a significant saving for me. This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's initial offer and my ideal price.  It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is a good compromise.  It's still a good deal for me, as I'm getting the product for $30 less than what John is selling it for.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become stubborn and we won't reach an agreement.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
