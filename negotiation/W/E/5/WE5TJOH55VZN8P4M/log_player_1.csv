"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob while still allowing me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low price just yet.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my desired price point. I believe this will be a fair compromise and hopefully Bob will accept."
