"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps me within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'll counteroffer at $11,750. I think this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from here.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,375. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",11375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, and I'm glad we're still in the game. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,375. I'll counteroffer at $11,750 again, as I mentioned earlier. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to stand firm here.",11750.0,Alice,7,
