"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay a maximum of $500000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $500000 is significantly lower than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my final compromise for now.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $500000 represents a fair valuation for the product. Let's aim for a middle ground. I am proposing $750000 as my counteroffer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $1200000, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm going to make one last offer, and it's going to be a strong one. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your final offer. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $1100000. My final counteroffer is $1050000.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been very patient and flexible, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last, final offer. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
