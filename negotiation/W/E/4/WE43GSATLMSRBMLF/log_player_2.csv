"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is quite high, and $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate before reaching our limit. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to compromise, and lands right in the middle of our previous offers.  This keeps us well below our alternative option of buying from John."
