"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $13,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product.",13750.0,Alice,5,
