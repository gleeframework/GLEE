Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $150, while still leaving room for potential negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable, and I am confident Bob will find it compelling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $175 is a better price than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. I will counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $190. This is still a good profit margin for me, and I believe it is a fair compromise considering his offer. I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $180 is a good compromise. While I was hoping for closer to $190,  it's still a better price than selling to John for $150. Accepting this offer will ensure a quick and profitable sale."
