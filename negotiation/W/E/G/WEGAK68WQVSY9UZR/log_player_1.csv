I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$7,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $11,000. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob.  We are getting close to my bottom line, so I'm eager to see if he will accept."
