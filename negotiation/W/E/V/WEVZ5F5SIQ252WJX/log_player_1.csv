Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to acquire this valuable asset while still providing me with a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I am comfortable moving forward with a purchase at $900000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price range and represents a significant profit for me. While I would prefer a higher price, it's important to consider the potential for further negotiation or the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and reduces the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
