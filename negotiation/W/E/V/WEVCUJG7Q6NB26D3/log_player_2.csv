"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire this product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and $800,000 to Bob. It's highly unlikely Alice would accept a price lower than $1,000,000, as it's more valuable to her. So, it's best to start negotiating and see if Alice is willing to lower her price. There are 9 more rounds, which is enough to get a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,000,000 is closer to my ideal price, I can still try to push for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and I might be able to get it for closer to my $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow you to still make a significant profit, and it's a price I can comfortably afford."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and it's getting close to my target price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away or I might end up buying from John, which is my fallback option. Accepting her offer now secures the product for a good price and saves time."
