"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above what the product is worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow you to still make a significant profit, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Alice,5,
