Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's maximum value, leaving space for him to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's a strong opening:** By offering a slightly higher price, you demonstrate confidence in the product's worth."
