,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while also being reasonable for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my current financial situation.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. My next counteroffer is $1,250,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my financial capabilities. Let's find a way to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $1,220,000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept and still ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I see we are both determined to find a compromise. While $1,220,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $1,180,000. This feels like a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this and finalize the deal.",1180000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to give up much more. I'm willing to make one final concession. My next counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this is the absolute lowest price I can accept and still ensure I'm getting a fair deal for the product. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
