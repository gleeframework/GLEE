Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more than my minimum of $80, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $110. This is still a good profit for me, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate and come to a compromise."
