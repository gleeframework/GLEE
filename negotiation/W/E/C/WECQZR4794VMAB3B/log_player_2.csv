"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $130 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  $130 is still above your target of $150. Let's try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is quite a drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is closer to my goal, I'm still aiming to get the price lower.  Let's keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
