"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $130 is fair. What do you think?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is quite a drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  This is a reasonable price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $110 is a good deal. It surpasses my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
