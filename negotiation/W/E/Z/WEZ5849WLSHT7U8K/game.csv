"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see an offer closer to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,120,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
