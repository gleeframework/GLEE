"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's within your budget, it's still too close to your maximum value. There's room for negotiation. 
* **It's early in the game.** You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $880,000.

**Next Steps:** Counteroffer with a price that's lower than $890,000 but still reasonable, considering Alice's previous offers. You need to find a sweet spot to convince Alice to sell and save yourself some money."
