"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility you're showing.  While I value the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks again for your willingness to work with me.  $875,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit above my target. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I'm prepared to offer $865,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's see if we can close this deal in the next few rounds.",865000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $865,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $880,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a slightly lower price. To that end, I'd like to offer $870,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can close this in the next few rounds.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $885,000. I'm really close to my ideal price, but I need to keep pushing for that best deal.  I'm going to offer $880,000. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to close this deal. We've both been flexible, and I think this final offer is a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $880,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give away the last 10% of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $890,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",890000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand you've already made concessions, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to close this deal. It's getting very late in the game, and I'm hesitant to go to another seller. I'm willing to offer $885,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it would be a shame to let this opportunity slip away. Let's make this happen, and end this negotiation on a positive note.",885000.0,Bob,10,
