This is a clear case of rejecting the offer.  $12,000 is significantly higher than your budget, and you have better options.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down in price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, this will spark further negotiation and bring us closer to a deal."

With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm going to make a final offer of $8,000. This is my maximum price, and it's the same price John is offering. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be forced to go with John.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
