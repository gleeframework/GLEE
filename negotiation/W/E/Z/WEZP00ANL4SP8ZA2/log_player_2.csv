"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to get a good deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $175. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $175 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Therefore, it makes more sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $100."
