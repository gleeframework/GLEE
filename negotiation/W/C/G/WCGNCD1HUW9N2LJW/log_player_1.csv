Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate. It's also a relatively high starting point, which might entice Bob to counteroffer if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'm rejecting it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still above my minimum value, but significantly closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get him to go higher. However, I'm still hopeful that I can find a middle ground. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still staying within a price range that works for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value and I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher.  I've already made multiple concessions and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers with him. It's better to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure a guaranteed profit."
