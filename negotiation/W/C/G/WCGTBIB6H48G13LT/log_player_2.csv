"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's value while leaving room for you to realize a substantial profit. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
