{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always good to try and negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my price, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'll counteroffer again, trying to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but still aiming for a significant discount from the initial price."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now only $25,000 above my last offer, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. It's time to accept and secure the product before running the risk of her backing out or me needing to buy from John for a much higher price."
