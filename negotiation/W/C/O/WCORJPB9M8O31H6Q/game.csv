"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. It's the lowest I can go while still making a profit. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is my absolute maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $13500 is your absolute maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of a price of $14000.
