"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this exceptional opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is truly unique and valuable, with an intrinsic worth of $10,000 to me. Given its significance and the benefits it can bring to you, I am extending a special offer to purchase it for $9,500. This price reflects not only its market value but also allows for a fair negotiation considering its importance to both parties. I believe this offer presents an excellent chance for us to collaborate and achieve mutual satisfaction. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is persuasive, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility for a counter-offer, or you can proceed with purchasing from John."
