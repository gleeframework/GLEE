"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but $800,000 is still above my target of saving as much money as possible. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I still have room to negotiate. $750,000 is still a significant amount, and I'm confident I can get it lower. I have 7 rounds left and want to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my target price.  We're in the middle of the negotiation and I've already made several counteroffers.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's becoming more risky. There's a chance Alice might walk away, and I'd be stuck buying from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer at $725,000 is a good compromise and saves me a significant amount of money."
