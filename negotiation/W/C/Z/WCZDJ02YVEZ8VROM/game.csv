"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
