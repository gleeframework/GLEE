Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to leverage Bob's potential interest.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still do better. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while I could try to negotiate further, I'm worried that we might reach an impasse.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's safer to sell to him and secure the deal."
