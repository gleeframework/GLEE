"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a special offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, you are looking to save as much as possible.  Since you have 10 rounds and know the product is worth $120 to you, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $105. This is my best offer given the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $110 to $105, showing some willingness to negotiate. This is a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for $15 less than what it's worth to you.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and you might end up paying more.  Accepting the offer now is the most sensible choice."
