Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. If he accepts, fantastic! If not, I'll keep an eye on John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If not, John is always a safe bet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit.  This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too low for me.  While I want to maximize profit, I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount.  John is offering a safe and secure sale.  I'll take it."
