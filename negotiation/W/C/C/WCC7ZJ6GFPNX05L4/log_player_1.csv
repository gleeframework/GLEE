Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **It shows confidence in the product's value:** A high starting point can create the impression that the product is highly valuable and worth the price. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely to adjust my strategy for the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000.  

I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is another compromise, bringing my offer closer to Bob's last one. However, I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to negotiate, Bob will be more likely to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are still too low for me. I'm now considering selling to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures I get a fair return on the product, even if I don't reach a deal with Bob.  It's time to take the secure option and close the deal with John."
