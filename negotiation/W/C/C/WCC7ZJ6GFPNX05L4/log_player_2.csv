(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the maximum I'm willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's also the price John is offering, so I'm not losing anything by starting there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal.  John is always an option if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still holding firm to a price below $1,500,000.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still confident I can negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my $1,250,000 target. John is always a safety net, but I believe I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to keep the price below $1,500,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying from her, but also that I'm not going to overpay.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get her to accept a price closer to my budget."
