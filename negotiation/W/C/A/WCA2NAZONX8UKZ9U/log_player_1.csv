"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I make a profit over my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price. I have 9 rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price,  $90 is a good profit and it avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
