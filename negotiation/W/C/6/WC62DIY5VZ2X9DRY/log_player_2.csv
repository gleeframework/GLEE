"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $950,000.
* Rejecting Alice's offer forces you to buy from John for $1,200,000.

Since $950,000 is less than $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you money."
