"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a fantastic deal for Bob! $500,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's no reason to buy from John at a much higher price. However, it's always worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal.  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price will test the waters and see how much negotiation room there is.  If Alice is serious about selling, she might be willing to come down to a price closer to Bob's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and $400,000 is still a great deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the next counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
