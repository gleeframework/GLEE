Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $120, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired price than if you started lower. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so you're not desperate. This gives you leverage to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
