"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a significant discount from my asking price, but it's the best I can offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $13,750.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not quite there.  $13,250 is the highest I can go at this point.  If you're willing to come down to this price, we can finalize the deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I need to stay closer to mine. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This gives us both a fair deal.  Let's wrap this up!",13500.0,Alice,7,
