# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. Our product, which I believe holds immense value for you, is now available for consideration. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, it is worth $800,000 to you. I am offering this remarkable item to you at a special price of $950,000. This offer is designed to provide you with the best possible value while ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this acquisition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's maximum budget is $800,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is above Bob's budget.
* While Alice claims the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, this is likely an inflated estimate.
* Bob can get the same product from John for $800,000, staying within his budget. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially advantageous option for Bob."
