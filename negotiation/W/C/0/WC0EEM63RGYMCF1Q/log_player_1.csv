"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potentially profitable deal for both of us.  It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling and willing to compromise."

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer only slightly above John's, it's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale to John. While I hoped for a better price from Bob, the risk of further negotiation is too high."
