"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  The value this product offers is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,225,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000.  I believe this offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,180,000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.  Let's try to close this deal, it's a good price for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
