"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, and it's always worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  The value this product offers is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his limit. There is room for further negotiation, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000.  I believe this offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer of $1,180,000 is still outside Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and it's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a more favorable price."
