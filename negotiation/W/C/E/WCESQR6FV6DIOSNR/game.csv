Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to come up with a better offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $9000? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value I'm placing on the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to listen to any further offers you may have.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we try $10500?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to go up to $11000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great way to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
