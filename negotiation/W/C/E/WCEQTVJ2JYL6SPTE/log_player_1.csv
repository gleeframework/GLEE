Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000. I believe this offer reflects its worth and is a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes fairness and the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to accept.

**Why not higher?**  While Bob values the product at $15,000, there's no guarantee he'd be willing to pay that much. A slightly lower offer increases the chances of acceptance. 

**Why not lower?**  Going much lower would leave potential profit on the table. You have a strong fallback option with John at $10,000."
