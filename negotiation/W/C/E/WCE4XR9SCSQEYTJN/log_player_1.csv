Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $115. I believe it's a great deal, as I know it holds significant value for you."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you some room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Value Awareness:** By mentioning that you understand the product's value to Bob, you're emphasizing that your asking price is justified.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer or negotiate, potentially allowing you to secure a higher price than John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, we know the product is worth $120 to him.  There's still room to negotiate a better price than $100. Rejecting his initial offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $108?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $108, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Meeting in the middle can be an effective negotiation tactic, as it can feel fair to both parties and encourage a quicker agreement.
* **Above Minimum:**  This price point ensures we still receive a profit above John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $105 instead. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $105 is a solid profit above our minimum of $100 and a reasonable gain from our initial offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might only yield a few more dollars, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the sale."
