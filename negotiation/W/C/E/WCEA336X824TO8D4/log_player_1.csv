Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below our minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive if Bob highly values speed or exclusivity.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning a public listing, we subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he rejects the offer."
