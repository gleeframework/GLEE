{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 80}
