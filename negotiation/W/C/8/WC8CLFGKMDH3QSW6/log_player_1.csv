"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at $11,000, which is a competitive price considering its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob.  I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly what the product is worth to him. Accepting this offer will allow me to maximize my profits while still closing the deal. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a quicker sale and minimizes the risk of the deal falling through."
