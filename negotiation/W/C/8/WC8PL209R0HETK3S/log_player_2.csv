"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this unique opportunity to you. The product I have to offer is of immense value and could significantly enhance your endeavors. I understand its worth to you is $8000, but considering its rarity and the benefits it provides, I believe we can find common ground. My proposal is to offer the product to you at a price of $9500. This not only allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a premium but also ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob is better off rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John."
