"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price. There's room for both you and Alice to find a mutually beneficial deal. You'll start the counter-offer process to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  I believe this price reflects the value while still allowing you a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is within your budget and a reasonable compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice walking away and you being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal at a price that's still significantly cheaper than John's offer."
