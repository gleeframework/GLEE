"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable product, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more by continuing to negotiate, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
