# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product from John for less.  Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, a counteroffer is the best course of action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This leaves some room for both of us to profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  Rejecting her offer again and making a counteroffer is the best way to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $925,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a fair compromise, considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. While you can get it for $800,000 from John,  the extra $125,000 is not a significant difference in the grand scheme of things, especially if it means securing the product without further negotiation."
