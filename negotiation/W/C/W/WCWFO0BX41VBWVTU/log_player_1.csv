"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is more than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $120 with some back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That way we both get a little closer to what we're looking for. "", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm trying to be reasonable by splitting the difference, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $120 while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're at your limit, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. How about we agree on this and move forward?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

I'm offering $94 as a compromise. It's a small increase from Bob's offer but still closer to my minimum than his offer. I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $91 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can do better with a counteroffer. I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, so I need to be assertive in these last few negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $91 is still too far from where I need to be.  Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to go down to $93.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm sticking to my ground, but offering a small concession to show that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that with only three rounds left, Bob will realize that he needs to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make one last compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $91 and $93, which would be $92. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in Round 8, which means there are only 2 rounds remaining. Bob has made his final offer, which is still below my minimum.  Considering the limited time and my desire to get as close to my $120 target as possible, I will sell to John for $120. It's a guaranteed sale and I'm not confident I can convince Bob to go higher in the remaining two rounds."
