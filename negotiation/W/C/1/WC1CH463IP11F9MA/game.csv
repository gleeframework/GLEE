"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $12,000 is a bit closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to purchase the product from you today.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
