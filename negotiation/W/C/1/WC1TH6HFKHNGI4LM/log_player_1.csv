**Reasoning:** 

Bob has landed back on his previous offer of $1,175,000 twice now. This indicates a potential sticking point for him. While it's tempting to try and push for $1,200,000, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's $800,000 offer is significant.  Accepting $1,175,000 guarantees a substantial profit at this point."
