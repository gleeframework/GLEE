Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob, as he's unlikely to go higher. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
