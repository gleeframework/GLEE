Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to start with an offer significantly higher than our minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and competition to create a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial high offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, we haven't lost anything and can always fall back on John's offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Depending on Bob's response, we might need to adjust our approach and potentially negotiate downwards."
