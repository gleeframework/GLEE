"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $13000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal.
* **There's value in negotiating.** You have 10 rounds, and you can always buy from John if negotiations fall apart. 

By rejecting the offer, you start the negotiation process and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial price shows you're serious but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Be polite and explain your reasoning:**  This helps maintain a good relationship with Alice.
* **Focus on your value:**  By stating that you're willing to pay a certain amount, you are setting the tone for the negotiation and emphasizing your interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm still firm on the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12000?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While she has come down, $12,000 is still above what you are comfortable paying.
* **There's room to negotiate further.**  You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to push for a lower price.

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you are serious about getting a better deal, and encourage her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $11,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it's a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  Emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" for both sides reinforces a collaborative approach.
* **Finality:**  The message conveys a sense of finality, suggesting that this is a good price and further negotiation might be fruitless."
