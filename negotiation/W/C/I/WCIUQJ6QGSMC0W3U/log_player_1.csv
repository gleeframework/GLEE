"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also not desperate to sell, as I have the option to sell to John for $10,000.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm still firm on the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $11500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see it's a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $13,000, we're already in the 4th round. If I reject this offer, Bob might get more stubborn, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  $11,500 is a good price, especially since I can sell to John for $10,000 if things fall through."
