# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. Let me know if this is something we can work with.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming a bit higher. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to go beyond $1,300,000."
