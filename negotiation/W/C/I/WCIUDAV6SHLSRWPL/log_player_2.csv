"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by you. I understand its importance and would like to extend this opportunity to you. Considering its quality and value, I propose to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects the high value you place on the product while allowing us to maintain a fair profit. I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than John's $150, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($80). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her to lower the price closer to her valuation."
