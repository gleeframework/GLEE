"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to sell for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
