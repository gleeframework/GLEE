Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

I'm starting with a significantly lower price, about 42% less than Alice's offer.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if there's any room for negotiation. I'm still willing to pay a premium compared to John's offer, but I'm leaving room for Alice to meet me in the middle."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

I'm going to stick with $800,000.  This is my absolute ceiling, and I'm willing to walk away at this point. I'm hoping Alice is motivated to close the deal and will accept."
