Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob is much closer to my valuation than I expected. While I could push for more, accepting his offer guarantees a significant profit.
