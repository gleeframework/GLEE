"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also factoring in that I have a safety net with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still too low. I'm going to reject this offer and try for a better price. It's starting to get risky, though. I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to lose before I have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product, as I am running out of time.  If he rejects this, I'll have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, but it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of time and the risk of having to sell to John is increasing. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Bob rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $13,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will be persuaded to buy at this price.  It's a risky move, but with only a few rounds left, I need to try and close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  I'm running out of time and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob.  $15,000 is still a good price, and it's better than risking a lower offer from Bob or potentially getting no offer at all."
