"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,250,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is getting more reasonable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
