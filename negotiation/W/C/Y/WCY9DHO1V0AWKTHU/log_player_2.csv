Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $100? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
