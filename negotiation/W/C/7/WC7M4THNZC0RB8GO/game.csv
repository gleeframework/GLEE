"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still quite a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about we start with $750,000? This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us a good starting point for further discussion.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is still a great deal for you. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and try $800,000?  This would give us both a good deal and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering $850,000, which is a 25,000 increase from my previous offer. This is my final concession, and I'm willing to stand firm at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
