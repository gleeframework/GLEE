Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. Let's try $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unlikely to go below $800,000. She's already made several concessions, and her latest offer is still $50,000 above John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $800,000 from John."
