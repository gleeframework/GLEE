"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above your maximum price and John's offer. You should counteroffer again and try to negotiate closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise and the offer of additional perks.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is firm but fair:** You're holding your ground at your maximum price while acknowledging her compromise.
* **Ends the negotiation:** By stating it's your final offer, you put the decision in her court.  This prevents the negotiation from dragging on. 
* **Keeps John as an option:**  If she rejects this offer, you can still buy from John at your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $13,500, which is a bit closer to your desired price. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,500. While you could try another counteroffer, it's risky. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is a guaranteed saving of $1,500. It makes sense to take the sure thing at this point."
