"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Plus, I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise and the offer of additional perks.  However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $13,500, which is a bit closer to your desired price. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
