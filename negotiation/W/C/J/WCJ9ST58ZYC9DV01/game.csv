"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $16,500? It's a fair compromise and still allows for some profit on my end.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $15,750. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",15750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but I need to make a bit more to make this worth my while.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $16,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $15,800. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",15800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $15,800 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15,900. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal.",15900.0,Alice,7,
