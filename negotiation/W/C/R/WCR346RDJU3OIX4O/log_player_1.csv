Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500.  I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Maintain Value Perception:**  The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, which may encourage him to act quickly if he's truly interested.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit by negotiating with Bob is worth the slight risk in this scenario."
