Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that even at this price, he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,000,000, I'm leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer without me immediately feeling like it's too low.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll assess his offer and either accept, reject, or counter with my own offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a clear limit to how low I'm willing to go.  I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept his current offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll consider factors like Bob's willingness to negotiate and my own urgency to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $950,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value, which will keep him motivated to reach a deal. 
* **Urgency and Time:**  This counteroffer is designed to encourage a quick decision.  I'm not going to lower my price significantly further, so I'm hoping to get a favorable outcome in this round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll assess Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Accepting or Rejecting:** If Bob accepts, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
