"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to its value to you, you can potentially get a better price.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $850000 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  At $950,000, you're still getting a good deal considering the product's value to you.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky - you could end up paying more or losing the deal altogether.  It's also worth noting that if you reject and Alice makes a counteroffer, she might increase the price again."
