"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This means you can potentially save $2,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice likely wants to sell the product and may be willing to negotiate.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed option for $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get a price closer to your $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.**  She's willing to meet you halfway at $9,500, which is still a good deal for you.
* **You can save $2,500.**  This is a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **The risk of further negotiation is minimal.**  You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has countered back.  There's a chance she might be firm on this price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiations or having to buy at a higher price from John."
