"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is too high, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you than that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's willing to keep negotiating and see if he can get a better price. He's also aware that he has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so he's not pressured to accept any offer that is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 8750}
