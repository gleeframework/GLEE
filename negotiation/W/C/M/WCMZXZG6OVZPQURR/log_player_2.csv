"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and Alice's initial offer is exactly at that limit, it's wise to try negotiating. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she's just starting the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $120?  I'm really keen on getting it, so I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount. A $30 difference is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Showing Interest:** The message highlights Bob's genuine interest in the product, making it less likely Alice will immediately reject the offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, suggesting flexibility and willingness to compromise."
