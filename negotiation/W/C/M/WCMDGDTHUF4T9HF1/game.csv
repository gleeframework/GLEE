,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. If you can do that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John.",90.0,Bob,4,
