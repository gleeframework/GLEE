Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80).** This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This helps avoid misunderstandings.

I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. If you can do that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and is a decent deal considering Bob is willing to go with John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $90."
