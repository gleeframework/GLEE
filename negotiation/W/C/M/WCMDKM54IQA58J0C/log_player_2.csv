# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's a significant savings compared to John's price and is within Bob's budget. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
