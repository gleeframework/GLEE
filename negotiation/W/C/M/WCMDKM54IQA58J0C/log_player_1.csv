Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You have space to negotiate up or down if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, the key is to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, you can still do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $13,000. 

You'll want to find a price point that:

* Is higher than Bob's offer, but 
* Still leaves room for a potential middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** You're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving in completely. 
* **Reasoning:** You provide a justification for your counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Closing:** The message encourages Bob to finalize the deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial and increases the chance of closing the deal."
