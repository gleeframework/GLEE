"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my current budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,300,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,310,000.  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.  Let's finalize this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,7,
