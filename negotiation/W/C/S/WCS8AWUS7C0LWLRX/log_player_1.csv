Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:** Starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The high price serves as a test of Bob's eagerness. His response will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides you leverage. You're not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value, it's still above your minimum. You've left yourself room to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to his maximum. You're not in a rush, and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your budget constraints, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I could consider coming down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer but in a significant increment ($150,000) to signal that you're not desperate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** You're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob closer to his upper limit.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  You've left space for further negotiation while still remaining comfortably above your minimum and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've proposed. I am willing to offer $1,550,000 for the product. I hope this might be within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum ($1,200,000) and John's standing offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that you can put to use elsewhere."
