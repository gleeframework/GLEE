"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in this product and willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in this opportunity. ",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you see its value. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's worth and I'm open to further discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a win-win solution. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is a $100,000 value, if you're willing to meet me at $1,700,000. This way, you'll not only get the product, but also the peace of mind that comes with our support and warranty. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
