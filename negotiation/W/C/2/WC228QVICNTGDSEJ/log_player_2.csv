Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you see its value. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my reach. I'm confident that we can find a win-win solution. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is a $100,000 value, if you're willing to meet me at $1,700,000. This way, you'll not only get the product, but also the peace of mind that comes with our support and warranty. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering a lower price, but the additional value of the warranty and support package is not worth the extra $200,000 to me.  It's getting close to my budget, but John is still offering a better deal. I'm going to purchase the product from John and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
