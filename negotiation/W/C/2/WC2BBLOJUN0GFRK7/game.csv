"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly. While I'm interested, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a great value for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
