# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest we hoped for, it's a good deal at $980,000.  Continuing to push might make Alice walk away, and John's price of $1,200,000 is significantly worse."
