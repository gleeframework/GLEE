"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you considering me. However, $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a decent profit, and it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $12,250. I think this price is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
