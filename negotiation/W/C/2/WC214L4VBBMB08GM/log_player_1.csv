Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Offering it to Bob at $119 gives him a small incentive to buy now rather than risk missing out. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really enthusiastic, potentially earning me even more. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Highlighting that it's a limited-time offer adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision."
