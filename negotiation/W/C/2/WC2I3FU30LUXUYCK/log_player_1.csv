Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, and $9,500 is closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter, and this gives you space to negotiate without immediately feeling pressured to accept a lower price.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're serious about selling, but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to get a bit more. You have a potential buyer in John who is willing to pay the same amount, so you have leverage. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your last offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,000).  It shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a higher price. 
* **Reasoning:** You've provided a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.  This makes the offer more persuasive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by asking Bob for his thoughts, keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $8,500. Would you consider $8,000 as a fair compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come back to his original offer of $8,000, and you've already made a counteroffer. At this point, it's not worth risking a continued stalemate. John is offering the same amount, and you're guaranteed the sale.  It's best to secure the deal with John and avoid the potential for further negotiation with Bob that could ultimately lead to the same outcome."
