"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $850,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
