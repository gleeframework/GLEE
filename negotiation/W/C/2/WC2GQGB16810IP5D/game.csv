"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $7,750 is closer, but still a bit low.  How about we try $8,250?  I'm willing to make a few more concessions, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. ",8250.0,Alice,5,
