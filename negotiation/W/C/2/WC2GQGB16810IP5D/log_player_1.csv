"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and even less than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give away the product at such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $7,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle yet and believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $7,750 is closer, but still a bit low.  How about we try $8,250?  I'm willing to make a few more concessions, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $8,000.  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is finally within my minimum acceptable price range, but it's still significantly lower than what John is willing to pay. There's a good chance that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I might not be able to get a better offer. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to accept John's offer and ensure a quick and profitable sale."
