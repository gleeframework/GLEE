Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  Let's meet in the middle again at $110.  That's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 110}

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112.50, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  While I might be able to get it for a bit less with more negotiation, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John for $150. It's time to close the deal."
