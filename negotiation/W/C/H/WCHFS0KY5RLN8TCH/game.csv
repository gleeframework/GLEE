"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price lower than its worth to you, and I can still get a decent return on my investment.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $800,000 for this deal to work. How about we split the difference and settle on $700,000?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Alice,5,
