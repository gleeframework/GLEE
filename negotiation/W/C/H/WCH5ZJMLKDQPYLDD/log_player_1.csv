{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the product's value to pique Bob's interest.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($150) while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down and still get a good price.
* I'm keeping the option of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. 
* **I need to negotiate further.** I'm willing to explore a compromise, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't at least cover my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. 
* If Bob continues to refuse, I will still have the option of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $140, which is halfway between my minimum value of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:** I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Staying flexible:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm still open to further negotiation but will keep in mind the option of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.** While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's only $20 below my minimum value of $150.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** It shows that Bob is willing to negotiate and I'm comfortable with this price.
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I can still sell to John for $150, but I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting a good compromise:** I'm choosing to accept this offer as a reasonable compromise, balancing the desire to maximize profit with the potential of losing the deal.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away entirely, and this offer is acceptable."
