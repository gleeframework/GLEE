"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a compromise. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
