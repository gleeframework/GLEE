{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. It gives Bob a good reason to negotiate, but also leaves you with some wiggle room. If Bob rejects, I can always go back to my backup buyer, John, for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is significantly below my minimum value of $150.  It's not worth selling at that price, and it's likely Bob will counteroffer again. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $150.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to sell the product at this price."
