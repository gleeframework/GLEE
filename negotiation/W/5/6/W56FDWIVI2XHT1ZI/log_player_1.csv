Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $12,000.  I believe in its value and think it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial offer:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  By framing the offer with the product's ""value"" and Bob's potential ""investment,"" you aim to shift the focus from pure price to perceived worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, you don't know his financial limits or negotiating style. There's a chance he'll reject an offer above $8,000 outright.
* **Alternative offers:** Depending on your risk tolerance, you could offer a slightly lower price (e.g., $10,000) to increase the likelihood of acceptance while still aiming for a significant profit."
