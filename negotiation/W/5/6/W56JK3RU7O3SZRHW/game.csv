"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $8,750. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
