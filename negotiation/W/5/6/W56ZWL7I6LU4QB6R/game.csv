"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $15000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we compromise at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $13500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. How about we compromise at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
