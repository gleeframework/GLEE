Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell it for closer to $100, Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum and represents a good compromise. It's important to remember that John is always an option, but it's worth trying to reach a deal with Bob before resorting to that."
