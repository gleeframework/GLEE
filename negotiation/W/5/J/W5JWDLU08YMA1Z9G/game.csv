,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  $9,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low just yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
