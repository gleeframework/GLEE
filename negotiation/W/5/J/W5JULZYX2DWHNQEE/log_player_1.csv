I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $105, I'm hoping I can get closer to my minimum of $120. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it's clear that he's not willing to go much higher.  Since I can get my minimum price from John, I'm going to take that offer."
