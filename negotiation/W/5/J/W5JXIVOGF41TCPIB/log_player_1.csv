"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a bit more.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also keeping my profit margin in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm still losing out on some potential profit. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm coming down a little, but still keeping a good profit margin. I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is my minimum, I'm still losing out on some potential profit. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round, hoping Bob is willing to compromise a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $90 as a final compromise.  Think about it - you're getting a valuable product for a fair price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to stick with a price that's still profitable for me, but close to Bob's offer.  It's a bit of a risk, but I'm hoping the ""final offer"" approach will persuade him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $82.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident that Bob will budge enough to make it worthwhile for me.  I'd rather take the guaranteed profit with John."
