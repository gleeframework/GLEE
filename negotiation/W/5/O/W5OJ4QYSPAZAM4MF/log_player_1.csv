Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the value it holds for your business. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement.  If you're not interested at this price, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather work with you if possible."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Balance:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates a negotiation space.
* **Incentive:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob and mentioning another buyer to create a sense of urgency.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, indicating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a better price than John's offer while leaving room for negotiation."
