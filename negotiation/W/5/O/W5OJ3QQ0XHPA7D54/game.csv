"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. Let's start the conversation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives us both a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $925,000 is tempting, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's compromise at $940,000. This allows me to make a decent profit while still being competitive for you.  Let's seal the deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. Can we revisit that price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
