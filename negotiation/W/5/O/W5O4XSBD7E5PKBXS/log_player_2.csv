"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price. You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, but it's calculated.  

* **You're showing Alice you're serious:**  You're not just trying to haggle a little, you're making a substantial counteroffer.
* **You're leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a $200,000 gap between your offer and Alice's bottom line, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation.
* **You're still within your budget:** You're still well below your maximum price of $1,500,000.

This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court. If she accepts, you get a good deal. If she rejects, it gives you an opportunity to see how much she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This price is still a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not your ideal price, it's still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  You're within your budget and securing a valuable product at a reasonable price.  It's a good time to end the negotiation and finalize the deal."
