Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It's not too far from your minimum:** This increases the likelihood Bob will accept or at least counteroffer.

I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  I need to get at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, his willingness to negotiate suggests there's room for a deal closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still above my minimum but closer to his offer. This will show my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my own interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price to show flexibility, but I'm still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him.
* **Suggesting a compromise:** The phrase ""split the difference"" implies a willingness to negotiate further, which could lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I need at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:** Bob is firm on his offer, and further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and unproductive.
* **John offers a guaranteed higher price:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, it's not in my best interest to continue this negotiation. Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for my product."
