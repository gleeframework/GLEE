"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for something worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to do $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to you, and it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your target price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for. You can try to get a better price by counteroffering again.  You're already in the middle of the negotiation and have shown willingness to compromise, so there's a good chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
