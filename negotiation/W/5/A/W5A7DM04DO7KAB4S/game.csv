"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still leaves room for you to profit and ensures that I receive a fair return. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about we settle on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
