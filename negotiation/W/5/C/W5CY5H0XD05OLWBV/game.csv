"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit too high on the price at $9,500. I'd like to propose a price of $8,200. Can you meet me in the middle?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,800. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. This is my final offer.",8800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to propose one last offer of $8,600. If you can meet me at this price, I'll be happy to buy the product from you.",8600.0,Bob,8,
