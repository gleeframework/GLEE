"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the fact that I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000. Let me know your decision.",1650000.0,Alice,1,
