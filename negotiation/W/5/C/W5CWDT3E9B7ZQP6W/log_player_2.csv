"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the fact that I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is fair in the context of the market, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget.  He can acquire the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the financially responsible choice."
