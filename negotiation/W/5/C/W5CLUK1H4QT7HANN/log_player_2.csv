The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice $95, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's below my maximum price point of $100, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in making a deal."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

I'm offering Alice $100, which is my maximum price. If she accepts, it's a good deal for both of us. If she rejects, I'll buy from John."
