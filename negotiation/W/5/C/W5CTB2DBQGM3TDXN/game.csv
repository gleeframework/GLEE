"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $700,000 and see where we go from there?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I value your offer, I'm not able to go as low as $700,000. Let's compromise at $850,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? That seems like a fair price to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
