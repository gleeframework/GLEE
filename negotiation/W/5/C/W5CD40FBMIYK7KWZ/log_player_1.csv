"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I have rounds to spare and can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to secure a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm running out of rounds, and selling to John for $150 would be the same profit.  It's better to close the deal now and secure the $140."
