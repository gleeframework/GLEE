"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know it's worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might consider. This gives me some room to negotiate down if he counteroffers, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. It's not worth it to me to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $145.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $145 is still a little below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $155 as a final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 155}
