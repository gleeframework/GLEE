,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $175 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $145.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $145 is still a little below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $155 as a final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",155.0,Alice,5,
