Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm valuing it at $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and interest,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her minimum. 
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the wording suggests potential flexibility. This encourages Bob to counter-offer, opening up the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If you know Bob is very price-sensitive and might be turned off by a high initial offer, a slightly lower starting point might be more effective. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject outright and go with a competitor. Alice seems willing to take that risk, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John."
