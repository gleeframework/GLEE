Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message frames the price as a ""limited time"" deal, suggesting urgency and potential savings for Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
