Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you and allows me to keep my profit margin. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
