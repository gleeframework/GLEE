"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting high, aiming for a price above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on the opportunity and value. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room to negotiate.  I'm prepared to potentially lower my price in subsequent rounds if necessary. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can easily secure a sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950000 to purchase the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I can potentially counteroffer at a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming for a more favorable deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm confident that I can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiations with Bob. 

**Strategy for Next Round:** I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000, potentially offering a price between $980,000 - $1,050,000. I'll be flexible depending on Bob's reaction and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer to an agreement. While $950,000 is a good starting point, my product's unique qualities warrant a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,025,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Compromise Tone:** I'm using language like ""willing to compromise"" and ""fair for both of us"" to signal flexibility and create a sense of cooperation.
* **Pressure and Time:**  I'm implicitly putting pressure on Bob by emphasizing the need to move forward with the transaction. This also subtly highlights the limited number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $975000 for the product. This amount still reflects the value I see in your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a substantial amount of money. This allows me to potentially build a relationship with Bob for future business opportunities.
* **Risk of John:**  While John guarantees $1,000,000, there's no guarantee that John will be interested in future deals.  By accepting Bob's offer, I maintain a potential long-term customer. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic choice. It's a strong financial outcome, and it opens the door for potential future collaborations."
