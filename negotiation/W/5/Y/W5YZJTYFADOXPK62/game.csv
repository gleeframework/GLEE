"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  I think that's a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let's find a middle ground here.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
