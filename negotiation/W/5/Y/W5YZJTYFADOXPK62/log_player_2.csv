"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price. It's always better to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds, you have plenty of time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  I think that's a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. Although she came down, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
