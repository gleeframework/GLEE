Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  I think that's a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my asking price of $13,000.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $12,000 is a fair price and it aligns with my minimum threshold.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and potentially having to sell to John at the same price."
