"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but leaves room for negotiation. The message is polite and expresses interest while still being firm about seeking a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to her lowest price, which matches what John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John at this point, as it won't save any money."
