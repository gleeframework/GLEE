Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum asking price of $10,000.  I'll counter-offer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still fair considering the product's value to you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
