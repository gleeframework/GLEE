I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,500,000.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal than John's offer if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on my desire to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible. I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise that will entice Bob to make a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if we can reach an agreement that is more beneficial for me.  John's offer guarantees me my desired price, so I'm going to sell to him."
