"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to consider a purchase at $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $1,400,000 is a bit too low considering the product's value. I'm willing to compromise at $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're open to it.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,500,000. However, I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. I'm willing to compromise at $1,550,000. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,500,000. Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
