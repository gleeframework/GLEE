"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your operations.  It's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly less than that. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
