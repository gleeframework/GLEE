Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $975,000. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer at $1,075,000.

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly.  She's gone up in her latest offer and is clearly trying to hold out for over $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing with her and potentially getting stuck with an even higher price. John's $1,500,000 is the safer option at this point."
