"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move my offer up to $950,000 to try to get this done.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm at $975,000.  Take it or leave it.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $975,000. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
