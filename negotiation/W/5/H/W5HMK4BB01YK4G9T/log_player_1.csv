I'm starting with my desired price, knowing Bob will likely counteroffer. I'm confident in my fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to be bold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

$900,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John for my desired amount. I'll counteroffer and see where it leads."

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still staying above Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I think I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob, and if not, I can always go to John for my full desired price."

I'm going to make one more counteroffer, offering a price that is still higher than Bob's last offer, but closer to what he's likely willing to pay. If he rejects this offer, I'll go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already made significant concessions and it's clear we're not going to agree.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
