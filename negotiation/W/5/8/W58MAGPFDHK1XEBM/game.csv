"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living, and $8,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $9,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price. I'm willing to go up slightly, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still pushing it for my budget.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $10,500.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $12,000, which is my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $11,250? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11250.0,Alice,9,
