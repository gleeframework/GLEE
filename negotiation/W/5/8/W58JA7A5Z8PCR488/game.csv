"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $9,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I really need to get close to my minimum price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal. Let's come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
