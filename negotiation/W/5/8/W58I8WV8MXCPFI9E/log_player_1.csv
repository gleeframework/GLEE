Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $11,000.  While it's likely Bob will reject this, it sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my $10,000 minimum by strategically counter-offering if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's previous offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for the same price."
