"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this investment.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant at $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $860,000?  I think this would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase at this price.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",880000.0,Alice,5,
