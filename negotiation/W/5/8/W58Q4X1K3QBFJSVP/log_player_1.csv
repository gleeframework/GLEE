Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than mine ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate, as it's not my absolute bottom line. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** I'm mindful that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $100. This knowledge gives me confidence to aim higher with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value.  I need to steer the negotiation toward a more reasonable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you making an offer, Bob.  However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $102?"",
""product_price"": 102
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting we meet ""halfway,"" I'm aiming for a price that feels fair to both of us, even though it's not an exact split of the previous offers. 
* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:**  $102 is still above my minimum price ($100), giving me some room to negotiate further if needed. 
* **Testing Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help me gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is not ideal, it's higher than my fallback option (selling to John for $100). Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and continuing negotiations might risk losing him altogether. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit."
