"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this product has the potential to be very valuable to me. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make a substantial move to bridge the gap, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle ground.  My final offer is $1,200,000.  This offer reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go for a product of this caliber.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my sincere interest in this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
