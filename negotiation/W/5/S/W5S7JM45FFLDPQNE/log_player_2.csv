"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a special price of $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000**.  This is higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000), but lower than the price John is asking ($1,500,000).
* **Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate further with Alice or buy from John**.  Even if you don't get a better price from Alice, you can still buy from John.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible**.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open and potentially leads to a better deal."
