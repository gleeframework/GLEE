"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
