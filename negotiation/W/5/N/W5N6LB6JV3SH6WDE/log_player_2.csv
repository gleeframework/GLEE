"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than your maximum price, you give yourself room for negotiation. This also helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is crucial for successful negotiation. Expressing your continued interest might encourage Alice to work with you. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** While you have a backup option with John, aiming for a price significantly lower than $12,000 means you could get an even better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your range, $14,000 is still above your budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation, and you haven't reached your maximum price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're showing willingness to negotiate by increasing your offer, but not jumping too high immediately.
* **Approaching Your Limit:** This offer is just below your maximum price, putting some pressure on Alice while still leaving you with a potential deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a simple reason for your counteroffer (""a bit of a stretch"") can make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll reach $12,000.  At this point, the potential savings with Alice are outweighed by:

* **Time Investment:**  Further negotiation rounds take time and effort.
* **Certainty:** John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, avoiding the risk of Alice not going low enough.

It's a good strategy to cut your losses and go with the sure thing when the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal."
