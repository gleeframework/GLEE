Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing he values it at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John provides a safety net. You don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
