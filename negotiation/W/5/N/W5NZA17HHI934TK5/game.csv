"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product has considerable value beyond even your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has more value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
