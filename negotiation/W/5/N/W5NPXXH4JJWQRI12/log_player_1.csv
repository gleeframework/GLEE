Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower allows room for negotiation and a potentially faster sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that still provides a significant profit margin. It's important to price confidently.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling quickly to Bob avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer, even if John is already lined up. 
* **Relationship Building:**  A slightly discounted offer positions the deal as mutually beneficial and starts the interaction on a positive note."
