Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Message:**  This is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I start with a higher price to create some negotiation room.
* I'm open to counteroffers but will keep my minimum price in mind.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer but will not drop below my minimum price.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel Bob isn't serious, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit out of my budget, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to drop that low. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $12,000, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm polite and explain my reasoning.  I'm hoping to reach a middle ground.
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to bridge the gap between our offers.  If Bob still refuses, I'll have to decide if I want to keep negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $12000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll continue to negotiate to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us. I'm confident I can get a better price than $9,500, but I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,500. I'm still a bit off from that though. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $10,750, which is the exact midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Message:** I'm again being polite and emphasizing the compromise and fairness of my offer. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground. If Bob rejects, I might consider lowering my price further, but I'll definitely sell to John if it seems like we're too far apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10750. How about we meet at $9000? I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're too far apart, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in further concessions from my side. I'm not comfortable with that. I'm confident John will purchase the product for $15,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering. It's time to move on and ensure I get the best possible price for my product."
