Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's above my maximum value, and it's a significant step closer to a final agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,
