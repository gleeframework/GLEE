Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, as it provides you with a substantial profit and still represents a significant savings for me compared to John's offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
