Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring a significant profit above our own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly above the midpoint between Bob's valuation and John's offer creates a sense of urgency and potential for Bob to get a ""deal"" before it's gone.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning other interested parties leverages Bob's fear of missing out, making the offer more enticing.

**Why this is better than offering $1,000,000 or slightly above:**

* Bob might be willing to pay a premium, especially if he perceives the product's value to be higher in the long run. 
* Starting too low could leave money on the table.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's willingness to buy at $1,200,000 if Bob declines."
