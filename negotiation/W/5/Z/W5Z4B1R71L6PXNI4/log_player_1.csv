This offer starts with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but significantly lower than my minimum price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
