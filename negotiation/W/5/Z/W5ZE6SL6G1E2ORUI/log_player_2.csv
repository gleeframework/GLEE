"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $14,000. It's not a good deal for Bob, and he should try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  A $1,000 reduction is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, but it establishes Bob's intent to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price.  He has the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 threshold. He increases his counteroffer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget. This is a moderate step towards meeting Alice's price, making it more likely she'll accept or counter with a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price of $12,000, but it's still $800 above it.  Bob has a strong incentive to continue negotiating because he knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's still a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further, especially as the negotiation progresses and time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to save some money. This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's price while still leaving some room for negotiation. With only a few rounds left, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise but also pushing Alice to meet him closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $600 above Bob's desired price. While it's tempting to accept, there are still a few rounds left, and Bob has a strong alternative with John.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue pushing for a better deal.  He's likely to get a counteroffer closer to his desired price, or even get Alice to accept his next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his limit, but still has the opportunity to save $200. He makes a final push with this counteroffer, offering $200 more than his desired price.  With only two rounds left, Alice is likely to feel the pressure to accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price. If she rejects, Bob has the option to go with John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's desired price, but there's still $400 difference.  With only one round left, the risk of a counteroffer that's worse than John's offer is too high. It's also possible that Alice might refuse to budge further. 

Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000 from John, it's the most sensible choice to avoid any further risk and secure the product at his desired price."
