"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A price of $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Reflects the value to Bob:** The offer is less than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), making it attractive.
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate, and I can likely get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount and leaves room for us to find a win-win. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, which is significantly more than John's offer of $8,000.
* **Negotiation progress:**  We have moved from my initial offer of $12,000 to $10,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the remaining rounds and John's offer.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a deal that is closer to my desired price, and it's  a significant improvement over John's offer."
