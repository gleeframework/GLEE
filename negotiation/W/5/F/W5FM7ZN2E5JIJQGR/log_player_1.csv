Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $115. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net at $100.

Offering the product at $115 creates a win-win:

* **Bob's Win:** Bob gets the product for $5 less than his valuation.
* **Your Win:** You maximize your profit by getting $15 more than your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a backup offer from John."
