Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point because it's a fair price that is higher than my minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $100, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum of $80 and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  This also saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
