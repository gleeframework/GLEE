"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which I believe reflects its true value.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $6,000 to start the conversation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can make it work.",8500.0,Alice,5,
