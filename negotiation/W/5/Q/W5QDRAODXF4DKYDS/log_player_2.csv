"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** While it's below your maximum, there's still room for negotiation and potential savings.
* **There's no urgency to accept.** You have the option of buying from John, so there's no pressure to accept Alice's first offer.
* **Counteroffering gives you leverage.**  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and could potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your target.** While still above your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from the previous round.
* **You still have room for negotiation.** You can likely get closer to your desired price of $1,050,000.
* **There's no rush to accept.** You have the option of buying from John, so you can continue negotiating with Alice.

By rejecting and making another counteroffer, you signal your willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500?  This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your target.** $1,087,500 is only $25,000 more than your desired price of $1,050,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.** While you could try to counteroffer again, it's possible Alice will stand firm, and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **It's a fair compromise.**  Both parties are making concessions, and you're still getting a good deal compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision. You're securing a significant saving over John's price while still getting a reasonable deal."
