"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to find a compromise.  Let's try $1,075,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,087,500?  This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
