"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit to make this deal work?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $750,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a good starting point for us to continue the negotiation.",750000.0,Alice,3,
