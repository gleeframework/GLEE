"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can definitely get a better price than $800,000.  Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get closer to your target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $750,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a good starting point for us to continue the negotiation.

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good deal for me. It's within my budget and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the product to another buyer."
