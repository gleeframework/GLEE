Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great value at $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing confidence:** By expressing belief in the product's value, I aim to establish a strong position.
* **Open to discussion:** The message invites Bob to engage in a dialogue, making the negotiation more collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I have a guaranteed $100 from John, which I can leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not to a point where it's significantly below my minimum. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, reminding him that I have an alternative buyer (John) waiting.
* **Maintain friendly tone:** The message remains positive and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Further negotiation might lead to a price I'm not comfortable with, and Bob seems unwilling to move significantly higher. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John ensures a certain profit ($100) and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
