Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $120. I believe it's a great deal and worth considering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than $80.  
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a chance to secure a price significantly higher than $80. 
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John if Bob declines. This eliminates the risk of completely losing a sale. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your negotiation skills."
