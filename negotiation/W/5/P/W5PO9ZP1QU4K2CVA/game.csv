"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for such a valuable product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your new offer. How about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for the product.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $9,400?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your original asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,6,
