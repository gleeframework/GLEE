"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still giving me a good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
