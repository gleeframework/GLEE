"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $95? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
