"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000 to $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is a significant jump, and it shows you're serious about this product. To be honest, though, taking anything less than $15,000 would be selling myself short. That's my absolute bottom line.  If you can meet that, we have a deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
