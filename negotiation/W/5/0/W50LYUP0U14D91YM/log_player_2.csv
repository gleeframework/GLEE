Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the exceptional value you're getting and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This offers you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my financial limitations. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the significant value you're gaining while allowing me to achieve a fair return. I believe it's a strong step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. You're getting closer, but you're still above your budget. Continue to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price. Keep in mind that you can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
