"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given my maximum limit is $1,000,000, I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000.  This allows for a significant profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the exceptional value you're getting and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This offers you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my financial limitations. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the significant value you're gaining while allowing me to achieve a fair return. I believe it's a strong step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which gives you a good profit while allowing me to remain within my limits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
