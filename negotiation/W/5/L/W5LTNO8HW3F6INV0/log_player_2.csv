Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down to $8,000, and further negotiation might be fruitless. Cutting my losses and buying from John guarantees the best price."
