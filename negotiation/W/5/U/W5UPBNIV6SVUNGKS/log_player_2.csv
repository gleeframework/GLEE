{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully give me a good starting point for negotiation and signal my serious intent to purchase at a lower price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's price is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's closer, I believe I can negotiate a lower price by continuing the process and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to stay below my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  I hope this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still above it. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,450,000, which is still below my maximum budget and closer to Alice's last offer.  This is a good compromise that hopefully leads to a deal."
