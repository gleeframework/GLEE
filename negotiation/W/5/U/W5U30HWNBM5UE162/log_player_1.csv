Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $800,000 to both of us.  I believe there's room for negotiation, but I'm confident I can get a good price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering a price of $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what the product is worth to me, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept it at this point, as continuing to negotiate could risk losing both Bob and John as buyers.  I'm satisfied with $775,000, especially given the potential for John to walk away with the product at $800,000."
