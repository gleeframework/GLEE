"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'm proposing a price of $700000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
