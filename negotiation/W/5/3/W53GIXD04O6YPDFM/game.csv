"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?  I think that's a fair price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's find a compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  How about $97?  That's a pretty significant increase from my last offer, and I'm getting closer to my limit.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $101 for the product.  This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think.",101.0,Alice,5,
