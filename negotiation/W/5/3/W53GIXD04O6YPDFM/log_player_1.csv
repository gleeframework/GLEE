"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?  I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, $90 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $105 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $101 for the product.  This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 101}
