Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $175, knowing it's higher than Bob's value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm trying to build rapport with a positive message.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  By starting high, I anticipate a counteroffer from Bob, which gives us room to bargain. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 provides a baseline for my negotiation. I won't accept offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting this would be a huge loss.
* **Room for Counteroffers:** I can still negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping for a compromise.
* **John's offer is a backup:** I'm not desperate for Bob's business.  John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $130 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired range. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price.
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, leaving the door open for more counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** $100 is my absolute minimum for selling the product. Accepting this ensures I don't lose money.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  While I could counter again, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. There's a risk of endless back-and-forth.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting now avoids the potential delay and frustration of more negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
