"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay as close to my budget as possible.",100.0,Bob,4,
