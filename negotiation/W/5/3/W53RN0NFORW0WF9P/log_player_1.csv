Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above Bob's perceived value of the product but still leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely that he'll be willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for the product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  How about $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
