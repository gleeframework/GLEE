"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort, and I appreciate that.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference - $1,225,000.  This price is still very advantageous for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a very competitive offer considering my other options.  What do you say, can we close this deal now?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
