"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, aiming to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and expresses interest while also making it clear our budget is limited.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $70 puts us in a good position. If Alice accepts, we get a great deal. If she counters, there's a higher chance we can settle somewhere between $70 and her initial $95."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a price we find acceptable, but it's still above our ideal target. We have room to negotiate further without risking the deal too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 is quite a jump. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:** $78 is a reasonable price that falls within both our budget and Alice's likely acceptable range. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation, encouraging a quicker resolution."
