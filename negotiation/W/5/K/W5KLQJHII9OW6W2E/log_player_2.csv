It's too expensive for you right now. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."

I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, as I can get the product for the same price from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get it for $80 from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $90, and I'm not sure if she's willing to come down further. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'll stick with my previous offer of $90. This is still a fair price, and it's getting closer to what Alice is willing to accept. If she rejects again, I might have to consider buying from John."
