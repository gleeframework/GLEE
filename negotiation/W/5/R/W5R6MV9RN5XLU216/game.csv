"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I know it's a significant investment, but I assure you it's worth every penny. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to sell it to you first. Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
