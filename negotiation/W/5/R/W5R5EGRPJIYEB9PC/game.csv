"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than what I'm asking. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that leaves room for both of us to benefit greatly. This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay a substantial amount. Consider this your chance to secure this asset at a price that's significantly below its true value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
