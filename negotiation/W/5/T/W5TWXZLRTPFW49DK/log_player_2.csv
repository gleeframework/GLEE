(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round. Alice's offer of $880,000 is still higher than my desired price, and while a counteroffer might be possible, there's no guarantee she'll accept. I've already pushed hard for a lower price and we're close to my target, but the risk of a failed negotiation is too high.  It's better to secure the product at a known price, even if it's slightly higher than my initial goal, than risk getting nothing.  Therefore, I'll buy from John for $1,000,000."
