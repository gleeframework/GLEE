"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work for me. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While $975,000 is closer to what I need, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's split the difference and go with $1,012,500. It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
