"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you see the value in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but that's as low as I can go.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from meeting you at $900,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. That's my final offer for now.",920000.0,Alice,5,
