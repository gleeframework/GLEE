Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:** I'm staying below my minimum ($150) to keep the deal potentially viable.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to make Bob more receptive. 

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is still above my minimum ($150), indicating that there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Strengthening My Position:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to hold out for a better price. This might make Bob more inclined to increase his offer in the next round.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the security to confidently reject Bob's offer without worrying about losing out on a sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? That way we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows I'm willing to compromise and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $135 is still above my minimum of $150, so I'm not sacrificing my own interests.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both of us, further encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

This approach aims to create a sense of urgency and a win-win scenario for both of us, hopefully leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $130 is the same as his previous offer, which I rejected. This indicates that we've reached an impasse.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and the risk of continuing could lead to Bob walking away, leaving me with no sale.
* **Securing a Guaranteed Sale:** John is guaranteed to buy the product at my minimum price of $150, ensuring I receive my desired value.

Selling to John guarantees a good return and avoids the risk of further negotiations that may not be fruitful."
