Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest level. If he's willing to negotiate down from $20,000, it indicates strong interest.
* **Backup Option:** We have a safety net with John. Knowing we can sell the product for $15,000 to John gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
