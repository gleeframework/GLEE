"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high. Would you be willing to settle at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",675000.0,Alice,5,
