"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than your desired price range.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
*  Buying from John right now would cost you more than negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still above her perceived value of the product. 
* This aggressive offer signals my serious intent to purchase while leaving room for negotiation. 
* I'm aiming to quickly find a price point that both Alice and I are comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer again, pushing the price back up.
*  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's current offer. 
*  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
