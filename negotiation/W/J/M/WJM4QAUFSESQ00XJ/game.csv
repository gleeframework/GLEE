"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to meet you closer to the middle, how about $1,050,000? This offer represents a significant reduction on my part and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
