Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $9,500 is less than what Bob is willing to pay ($10,000). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $10,000.

By starting with a slightly higher offer, you increase the chances of a successful negotiation while still leaving room to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my ideal. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. I'm confident I can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,250. This price is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not willing to accept a price significantly below my initial offer.
* **It's lower than my first offer:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes the deal more attractive to Bob.
* **It still leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a chance to counteroffer, while also setting a firm limit for what I'm willing to accept.

This counteroffer maintains the momentum of the negotiation while increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
