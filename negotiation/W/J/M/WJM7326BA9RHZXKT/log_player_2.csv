"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Max:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Alice's Min:** Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's room for both of them to get a better deal.  Bob can likely get the product for less than $9,500.

By rejecting, Bob opens the door for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial counteroffer is $9,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $9,500, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Reasoning:** This counteroffer is in the middle of Bob's max ($10,000) and Alice's potential minimum ($8,000). It signals Bob's seriousness while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  By starting at $9,000, Bob can adjust his offer down if necessary, but he's also leaving some space for Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $9,250.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the price difference is only $750. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice backing out or simply refusing to go lower. It's more efficient to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $9,250 is the most reasonable choice. It's a good deal for Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the product or needing to pay the full $10,000 to John."
