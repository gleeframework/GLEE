"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $12000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you have a limit, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $14000, which is a significant move from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,6,
