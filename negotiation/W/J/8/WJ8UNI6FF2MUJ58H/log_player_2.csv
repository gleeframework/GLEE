Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $16000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $16,000 is still above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a limit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $14,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $17000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above Bob's maximum budget. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
