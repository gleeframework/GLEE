"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value and potential return on investment this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a significant gap from my bottom line. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,950,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and potential.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.

I need to know if you're willing to move forward at this price or if we need to explore other options.",1925000.0,Alice,7,
