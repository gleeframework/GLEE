"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $14,000 is still above your target price. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting close to your limit, but it's worth trying one more time to get closer to $12,000. If she rejects this next counteroffer, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. I can do $12,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a great product, and I'd be happy to close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems Alice is unlikely to go below $12,800. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000. You've negotiated well, but sometimes getting a sure thing is better than risking it for minimal potential savings."
