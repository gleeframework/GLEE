"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're really close. I can do $12,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a great product, and I'd be happy to close the deal today at that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,7,
