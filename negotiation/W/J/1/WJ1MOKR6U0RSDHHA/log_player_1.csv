Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so you don't want to go lower than that with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob.  This means there's a chance he might accept a price higher than that, especially if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.
* **Aiming High:**  Starting with a price of $10,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Clear Communication:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach makes your position clear and can sometimes lead to quicker decisions. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, by aiming higher, you maximize your potential profit if he accepts."
