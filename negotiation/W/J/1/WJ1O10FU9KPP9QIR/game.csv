"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. However, I'm willing to throw in a bonus feature that will add significant value to the product. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'll include this bonus feature, making the overall value of the product even greater. It's a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
