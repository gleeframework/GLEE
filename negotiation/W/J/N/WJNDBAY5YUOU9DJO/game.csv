"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I am still unable to meet at $110. Would you consider selling it for $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little hesitant to go lower than $110. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",107.5,Alice,5,
