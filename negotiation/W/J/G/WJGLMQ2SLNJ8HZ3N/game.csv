"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my commitment to making this deal work. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
