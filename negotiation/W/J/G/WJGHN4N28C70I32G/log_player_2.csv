Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  It's significantly less than what I would receive from other buyers.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and a reasonable compromise for me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, given the value of the product. However, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000 and you have a sure thing with John at $800,000."
