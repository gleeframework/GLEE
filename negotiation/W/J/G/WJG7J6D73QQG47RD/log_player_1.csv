Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It offers incredible value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  By offering a price of $19,000, you set a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than his $10,000 valuation.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal if you choose to reduce the price slightly. 

**Important Note:**  While John guarantees a minimum sale, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob first is the optimal strategy."
