"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the guaranteed price from John. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a lower cost."
