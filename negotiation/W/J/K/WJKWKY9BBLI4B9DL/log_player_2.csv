"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'd like to start the conversation at $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Alice's minimum of $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

However, the value this product represents, particularly to someone like yourself who can maximize its potential, is truly exceptional.  I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value it brings to the table. Let me know your thoughts.
