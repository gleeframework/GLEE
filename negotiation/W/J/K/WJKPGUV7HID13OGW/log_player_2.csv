"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. By offering $100, he is showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but also trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a better price. There are still multiple rounds left, and Bob can still save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price but still trying to save a few more dollars. This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, indicating a sincere desire to close the deal. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept $110."
