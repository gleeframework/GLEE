"Hi Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm going to meet you at $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and I pay $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $95, which would be $97.50. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,7,
