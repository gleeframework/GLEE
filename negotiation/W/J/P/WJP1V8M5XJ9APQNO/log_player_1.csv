Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is a strategic move. It's just below your minimum acceptable price but still offers Bob a perceived discount, making it more enticing for him to accept. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
