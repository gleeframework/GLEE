"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $12,000 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be Direct:**  We're acknowledging Alice's offer but stating clearly it's not suitable.
* **Start Low:**  While we're willing to pay up to $15,000, aiming low initially gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Show Seriousness:** By proposing a specific price, we demonstrate that we're serious about buying if the terms are right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still aiming for a better price than $11,500. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We're acknowledging that Alice is negotiating and that we appreciate her movement.
* **Holding Firm (But Fair):** We're not drastically changing our desired price, showing we're serious about the $10,000-$10,500 range.
* **Simple and Clear:**  The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Alice to understand and hopefully accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. It's the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:**  $11,000 is a solid price, saving us $4,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  She's signaled this is her final concession. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
