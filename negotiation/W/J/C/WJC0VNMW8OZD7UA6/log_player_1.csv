Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it to you for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the higher price. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the phrasing suggests you might be open to negotiation if Bob pushes back. 

By starting with a strong offer, you maximize your chances of either securing a high sale with Bob or moving to your fallback option with John."
