"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $8,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $8,000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more attempt to bridge the gap. I'll offer you a deal at $9,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Alice,5,
