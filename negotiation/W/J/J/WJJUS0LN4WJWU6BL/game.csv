,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $120 right now.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $160, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a discount from the original price. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $160 is still a bit more than I can spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $140.  It's the most I can afford, but I'm truly interested in the product.",140.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I can do a bit better than $140, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",155.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm really trying to get the best deal I can.  $155 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you be willing to come down to $145?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",145.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,150.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go below $150. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $150, which is my minimum price. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",150.0,Alice,7,,
