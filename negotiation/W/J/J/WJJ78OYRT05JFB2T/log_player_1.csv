Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John, so I'm not under immense pressure to make a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm hoping to get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to raise his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $16,000, which is closer to my desired price. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away is increasing. Accepting his offer ensures a sale for a price I'm comfortable with."
