"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13500? This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $12500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
