Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its future potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product at $1,150,000 gives her a chance to make a $150,000 profit over her minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If Bob pushes back, Alice can slightly reduce the price and still secure a significant profit. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a potential negotiation process. If she wants a faster, more straightforward sale, she could offer a price closer to $1,200,000."
