,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,500 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500 as a final compromise. This is just above my minimum and a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
