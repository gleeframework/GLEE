"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm happy to consider a price of $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This price recognizes the value we both see in it, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
