**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob hopes to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.  It's a calculated risk, as there's always the possibility that Alice will stick to her price or become unwilling to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate with Alice are minimal.  Bob decides to cut his losses and buy the product from John to avoid the risk of further negotiation breakdowns and ensure he gets the product at a price he can reasonably afford."
