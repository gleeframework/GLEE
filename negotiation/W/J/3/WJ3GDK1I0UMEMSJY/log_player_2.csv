"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $180.  This is a significant difference, making it a bad deal for Bob. Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay the maximum of $120 for the product. This is the price John is offering, and Bob is willing to walk away if Alice doesn't accept this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value of $120. Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice or choose to buy from John for a guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 130} 
```

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. He's increasing his offer slightly from $120, but he's staying well below Alice's offer of $160.  This is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still being firm about his maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $120.  It's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to a price Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's best for Bob to end the negotiation and buy from John for a guaranteed price of $120."
