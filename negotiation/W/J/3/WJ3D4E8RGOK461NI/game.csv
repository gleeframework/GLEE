"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. But $7,000 is just too low. How about we split the difference and go with $7,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could do $7,200.  That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",7200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  Let's split the difference again and go with $7,400. I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",7400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I can go up to $7,300, but I can't go any higher.  If this works for you, we have a deal!",7300.0,Bob,8,
