{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a great deal, but you can potentially save more money by negotiating.  You are willing to pay up to $800,000, so there is room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at $500,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, and it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this gives us a starting point for a good back-and-forth."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $650,000 is still more than I'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $550,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good price but I'm also willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will lead to a final deal somewhere between $550,000 and $650,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice is firm at $675,000. This is getting close to my limit and buying from John would cost me significantly more. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
