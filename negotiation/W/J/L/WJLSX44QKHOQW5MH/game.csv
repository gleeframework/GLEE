"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe there might be room for a lower price. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",150.0,Bob,4,
