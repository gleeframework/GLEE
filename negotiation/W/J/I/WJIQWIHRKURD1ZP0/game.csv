"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value I'm confident this product will bring to your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly adjusted price of $1350000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it presents a strong opportunity for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
