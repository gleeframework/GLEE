Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer by highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""value"" subtly justifies the high price without directly revealing Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John at a lower price."
