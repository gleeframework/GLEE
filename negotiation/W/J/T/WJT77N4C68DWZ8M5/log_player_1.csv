"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. While we want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's worth negotiating further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're coming down in price but still aiming for a figure significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This strategy balances our desire for a higher profit with the need to find a compromise that might appeal to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this offers a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000. While it's less than our initial asks, it represents a significant profit. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer, potentially pushing him closer to our minimum or even below. It's prudent to accept this offer and secure a profitable outcome."
