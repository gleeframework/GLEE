"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
