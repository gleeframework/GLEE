"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10500? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that $9500 is still a bit below the product's value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about $10200? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and features.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has some great features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10200, which would be $10050. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10050.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not sure if $10050 is a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think it's worth $10800. I'm confident that the product's features and quality justify this price. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a stalemate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can do $10750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",10750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $10750. I'm willing to pay $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
