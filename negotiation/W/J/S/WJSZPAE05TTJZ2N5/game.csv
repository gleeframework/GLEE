"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product holds.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.  This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and allows you to get this valuable product at a price that's still very attractive.  Let's seal this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,080,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to secure a product that will bring you significant benefits.  What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
