"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be open to that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum.  Let's finalize this deal!",12000.0,Alice,5,
