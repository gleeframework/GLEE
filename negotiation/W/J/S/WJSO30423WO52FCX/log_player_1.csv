"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary.

I'm assuming Bob doesn't know the product's true value to me, so I'm starting high to try and maximize my profit. 

I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see what Bob's initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher price. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 unless I'm absolutely sure I won't get a better deal. 

I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's no pressure to settle for less right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still significantly above Bob's latest offer and above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a reasonable profit.  

I'm hoping that by making a moderate concession, I can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hesitant.  It's only $100,000 above my minimum and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I have some leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,450,000. This is a compromise from my previous counteroffer and only $50,000 below Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible and get closer to his price while still ensuring a good profit for myself.  

I'm hoping this small adjustment will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer.  However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price."
