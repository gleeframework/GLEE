{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000.  

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is Bob's last chance to get a better deal than John's offer.
* **Minimal savings:**  While Alice's offer of $870,000 is close to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer.  He is not likely to get a better deal from Alice in the final round. 
* **Potential risk:**  Alice may not budge further, and Bob could be left with no product at all.

It's better to secure the product now from John at a known price, ensuring Bob gets what he needs within his budget."
