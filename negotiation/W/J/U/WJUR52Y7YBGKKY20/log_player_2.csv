"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
