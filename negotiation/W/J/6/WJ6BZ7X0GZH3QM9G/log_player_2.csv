"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

Let's start by making a bold counteroffer.  A million dollars is a significant discount, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me.  This should get Alice's attention and open up negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, but not enough.  Let's try to push for a lower price again.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but we need to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

Let's see if we can meet in the middle. $1,100,000 is a fair compromise between my initial counteroffer and Alice's latest offer.  It shows I'm serious about buying, but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting stubborn, but I'm not giving up yet.  We're still too far apart on price.  Let's see if I can get her to budge with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

We're close!  This offer is a slight increase from my last one, showing flexibility.  It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see that we're both trying to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  I've made several counteroffers, and while we're closer than we started, it's getting risky to continue.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether."
