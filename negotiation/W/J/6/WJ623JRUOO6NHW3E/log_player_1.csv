"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $10,500 is still quite high. I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to $12,000,  Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's important to remember that I've only got 10 rounds to close this deal, and there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or worse. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, but the risk of losing a potential buyer like Bob is not worth it at this point. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
