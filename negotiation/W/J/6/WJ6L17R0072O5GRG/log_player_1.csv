"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It also sets a high baseline for value in Bob's mind.  I'm confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so this price reflects that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $1,100,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my initial goal.  The time is running out, but I'm not ready to settle for significantly less.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will finally be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though we are getting close to my floor price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm also starting to consider the risk of not getting a better deal and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000, but I don't think I can go any lower. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this price, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Even though Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, it's getting too risky to continue negotiating.  I'm afraid that if I reject Bob's offer, he might decide to walk away completely, leaving me with nothing.  Selling to John at least guarantees me a safe and reasonable price, even if it's not ideal."
