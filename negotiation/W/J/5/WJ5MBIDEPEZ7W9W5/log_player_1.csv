"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my target price, knowing that Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to set the bar high and potentially force him to make a counteroffer.  If Bob rejects, I can then start negotiating from a slightly lower point, but still aiming for the best possible price.  I also have John as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if things don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good price for me, and it's a more realistic starting point for further negotiation.  I think this will keep Bob engaged, but also push him to consider if he's willing to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can still push for a higher offer, especially considering I have John as a backup buyer. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I believe it's a good compromise. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept, or at least lead to a final agreement in the next few rounds."
