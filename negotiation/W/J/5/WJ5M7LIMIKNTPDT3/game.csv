"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you see in our product and your budget constraints, I am willing to negotiate further. I am proposing a revised price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still represents a premium over its intrinsic value but offers a substantial discount compared to our initial asking price. I hope this revised offer meets your requirements and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 remains my absolute limit for this product.  If you're unable to come down to that price, I'll have to go with my other option.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
