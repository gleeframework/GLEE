{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale that's better than my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his offer and my remaining time. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's still interested. This gives me an opportunity to counter and hopefully find a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me leverage to hold firm on my negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than my initial offer. I'll try to find a price that's still appealing to Bob but also closer to my target value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Positive Language:** I'm still using positive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that the offer is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter again or accept John's offer. 
* Each rejection brings me closer to selling to John, giving me leverage to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That would be a great compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I'm still confident that I can negotiate a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to push for a few hundred dollars more, even if it means risking selling to John.
* **Leveraging John:** Having John as a backup option gives me the confidence to hold firm on my price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price. I'll aim for $10,400-$10,500. 
* If Bob rejects again, I'll likely sell to John. However, I want to explore all options before taking that route."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget and appreciate your persistence. How about we meet at $10,400?  It's a small step up from your offer, but it's also a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to closing this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $150 from Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the potential for finalizing the deal with this offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell to John.  My goal is to maximize my profit, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get much closer to my desired price without risking the deal entirely."
