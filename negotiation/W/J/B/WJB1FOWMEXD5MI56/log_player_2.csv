# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is better for you than buying from John for $12,000.  You save $2,500 by accepting Alice's offer, even though you're paying slightly more than the product's value to her."
