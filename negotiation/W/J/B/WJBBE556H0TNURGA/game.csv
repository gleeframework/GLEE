"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is quite high for me too. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $9,200?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,200. How about we try $8,800 again, or even $8,900?",8900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,900 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $9,000 even?  This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $9,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
