Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $12,000.**  I know I can get this from John, so I won't sell for less.
* **I want to maximize my profit.** By offering $15,000, I give Bob a potential bargain if the product is worth more to him. 
* **I'm taking a calculated risk.**  If Bob values the product less than $15,000, he'll reject the offer. However, the potential of earning a higher price justifies the risk. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
