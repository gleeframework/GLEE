"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first.  What do you say to a starting price of $1,500,000?  I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (plus I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer).  I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I need to. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While it's a step closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $1100000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have 6 more rounds to try and reach a better price with Bob.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  To be honest, I'm starting to think that we may not be able to agree on a price.  To show you I'm serious about finding a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1050000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not desperate to sell. I will try to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. If I can't get a better offer from Bob in the next few rounds, I might consider selling to John for $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
