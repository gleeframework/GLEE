{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $150. This means Alice is trying to get a much better deal than she should.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

You should aim for the maximum price you're willing to pay.  You've indicated $80 is your limit, so let's start there and see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a much better price than she should. You are willing to pay $80 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $140. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

You're getting closer, but Alice is still asking for too much.  Let's offer $100. This is a significant compromise from your initial offer, but it's still well below what Alice wants."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still trying to get a better price than she should. You are willing to pay $80 for the product, and Alice is offering it for $125. You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price. You are running out of rounds, but a better price is still possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

You've reached a point where you need to decide how much you're willing to compromise to avoid buying from John.  $110 is a reasonable offer, as it's closer to Alice's desired price, but still within your limit. You only have two rounds left, so a compromise might be necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only one round left, you've reached a point where it's unlikely you'll reach an agreement with Alice. Alice is still asking for too much, even after multiple counteroffers. You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, but Alice isn't budging.  Since you're already close to your maximum price, it's better to buy the product from John for $80 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the product."
