{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It makes sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's designed to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It also gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm now offering Alice my maximum price of $1,200,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Alice has already come down in price, so hopefully, she will accept this offer. If she rejects, I'll buy from John at this price."
