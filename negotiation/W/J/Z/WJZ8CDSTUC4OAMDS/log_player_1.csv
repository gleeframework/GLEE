Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John, but lower than my own valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a price closer to my valuation and still above his initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at his valuation. While this isn't the best I can do, it's still a good deal for me. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price, and I risk losing out to John if I keep declining offers."
