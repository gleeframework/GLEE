"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $16000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $17000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",16500.0,Alice,5,
