Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value"" of the product subtly implies it's worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, there's no need to mention him to Bob.  It weakens your negotiating position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This phrase signals to Bob that you're willing to work with him, potentially leading to a price higher than your $12,000 minimum."
