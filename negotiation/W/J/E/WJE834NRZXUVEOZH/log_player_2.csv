"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice's offer is $9,500. 
* **There are still rounds left.** You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.**  You want to show Alice you're serious about buying but also demonstrate you're willing to negotiate.
* **Reduce the price by a significant amount.** $9,000 is a $500 reduction from Alice's offer, which is a good starting point.
* **Stay within your budget.** $9,000 is still within your $10,000 limit.

**Next Steps:**

Wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer. If she rejects, you'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, or move on to John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although it's a slight decrease from her previous offer, it's still above your desired price. 
* **You have more room for negotiation.** You can continue to push for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

Make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired price point, perhaps around $9,000 or a little lower. Remember, the key is to balance pushing for the best deal while also considering the possibility of needing to buy from John if negotiations fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.** Her offer is lower than her initial one.
* **This is a more aggressive counteroffer.** We're getting closer to Alice's desired price, but still within our budget.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation.** If Alice rejects, we can still make another counteroffer, potentially around $8,950.

**Next Steps:**

We need to wait and see if Alice accepts this counteroffer. If she doesn't, we'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, or move on to John."

Make another counteroffer in the next round.  Consider offering a price closer to $8,950, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal.  Remember, if Alice keeps rejecting your offers, you may have to consider buying from John."

{""product_price"": 8950}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're getting closer to a deal.**  Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, so it's time to meet her halfway.
* **This offer is a good compromise.** It's a reasonable increase from your last offer, while still being lower than Alice's latest offer.
* **We have rounds left.**  If this offer is rejected, we can still adjust and make another counteroffer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

We need to see if Alice accepts this offer. If she rejects, we'll need to evaluate the situation and decide if it's worth making another counteroffer or moving on to John's offer."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're nearing the end of negotiations.** With only two rounds remaining, it's time to make a strong but fair counteroffer.
* **A slight increase from our previous offer.** This shows we're willing to meet halfway, but not give up on getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**

We need to wait for Alice's response to this counteroffer. If she rejects, we'll need to make a final decision in the next round: either accept Alice's next offer or go with John."
