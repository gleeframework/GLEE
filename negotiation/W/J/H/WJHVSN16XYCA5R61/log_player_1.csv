Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire it directly and avoid potential competition."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and the benefit of avoiding a public sale (and potential bidding wars) provides a rationale for the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it implicitly invites Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the product's value and Bob's potential interest while ensuring you don't sell for less than your guaranteed price."
