"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $25000. I would like to propose an offer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking more along the lines of $20000. This is my best offer at the moment, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $20000 is still out of my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $15000 for the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that we've reached a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $20000, so I'm thinking $17500 is a fair price. Let's see if we can shake hands on that.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $16000 for the product.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $18000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to consider it.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $17000 for the product.",17000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $18500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",18500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've done some research and found that the product might not be worth as much as you initially thought. I'm willing to offer you $17500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its current market value.",17500.0,Bob,10,
