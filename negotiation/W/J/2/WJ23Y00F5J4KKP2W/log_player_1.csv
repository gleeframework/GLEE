"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $120 is more than Bob thinks it's worth, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a lower price, but not too low to risk losing the sale altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $140 to make this work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $130.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price that's slightly higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer of $130, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  How about $135?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my original goal, with only 4 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer of $132 is the best decision at this point. It's a fair compromise and ensures I make a profit.  Selling to John for $150 is tempting, but the risk of losing Bob altogether in the next round outweighs the extra $18."
