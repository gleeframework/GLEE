"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is at Bob's maximum budget.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it allows him to get the product at a price he's comfortable with.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's a chance Alice could reject a counteroffer and then Bob might end up having to pay more.  Additionally, buying from John at $1,200,000 would result in the same cost."
