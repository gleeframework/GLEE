"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Anchor:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value upwards.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to assess his eagerness and potential budget.
3. **Maximize Profit:**  Increase the chances of closing the deal at a price closer to my target.

Throughout the negotiation, I will carefully analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind my alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a step in the right direction, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. 

I will proceed to the next round and present a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap and steer the negotiation closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth and potential of this product, which I believe will be highly beneficial for you. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $300,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:**  However, I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This keeps the negotiation alive and leaves room for further compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, using phrases like ""find a middle ground"" and ""work together"" to maintain a positive atmosphere.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Signal Willingness to Negotiate:** Show Bob I'm serious about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** Avoid devaluing the product while still moving closer to a potential deal.
3. **Encourage a Counteroffer:** Prompt Bob to make a more competitive offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $1,400,000 is the highest I can go at this time. This price reflects a fair compromise and provides a profitable outcome for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $400,000, which is a strong return. It's always good practice to recognize a good deal when it's on the table."
