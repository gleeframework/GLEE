"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $100 if possible. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is just not possible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to $100. Could you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'd like to stay within my budget, so could we perhaps aim for $110?",110.0,Bob,6,
