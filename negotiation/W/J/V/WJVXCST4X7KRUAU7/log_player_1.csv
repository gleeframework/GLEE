"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for something worth much more! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's value, I'm giving him an incentive to negotiate, but still within a range where I can potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $100 if possible. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I still see potential to reach a compromise. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $90 is just not possible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $175 to $125, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not giving in to Bob's unreasonable low offer.
* **Reframing the deal:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that $125 is still a good price for him.
* **Maintaining profit:** $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to $100. Could you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $105 is still below my acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John remains a safety net:** If Bob continues to refuse, I can sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing a ""fair compromise"" and ""both walking away happy"" to create a positive tone and encourage acceptance.
* **Still above minimum:** $115 remains above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'd like to stay within my budget, so could we perhaps aim for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $110 is only $5 away from my previous offer of $115 and is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating. There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and I risk losing a deal that's close to my minimum.
* **Better than John:** While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, accepting Bob's offer allows me to make a profit and close the deal sooner.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $110 is the best choice at this stage.**"
