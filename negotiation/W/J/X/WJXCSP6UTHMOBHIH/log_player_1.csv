Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially extract more value from Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Bob's initial interest and give me an idea of his potential budget. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fall through. 

I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my desired price range.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering.
* **Maintaining Control:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a loss for me, and rejecting allows me to remain in control of the negotiation. 

I'm ready to counter-offer Bob and try to secure a price that's more beneficial to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $1,400,000 is still a significant amount above Bob's offer, signaling that I'm not desperate and have room to negotiate further.
* **Strategic Approach:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving, while still giving me a chance to secure a higher price.

I'm ready to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. Further negotiation might not yield significantly more profit.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to Bob getting a better offer from someone else.
* **Security:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale that's significantly higher than selling to John.

It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal completely.  In this situation, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical and secure option."
