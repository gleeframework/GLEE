"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price, considering the value to me.  Let's reach an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
