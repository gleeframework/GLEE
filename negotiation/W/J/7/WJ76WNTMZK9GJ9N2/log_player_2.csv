"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better deal than John's $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, so his counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, showing that Bob is serious about buying the product but also trying to negotiate a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes Bob's desire to find a price that works for both parties, leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $900,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Good Deal:**  $900,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to lower the price further. 

Accepting the offer at $900,000 is a good compromise that secures a lower price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
