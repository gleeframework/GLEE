"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $900,000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
