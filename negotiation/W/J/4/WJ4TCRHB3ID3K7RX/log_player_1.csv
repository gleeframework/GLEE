Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $1200000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
