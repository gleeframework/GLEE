{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  It's important to remember:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $100.** I won't sell it for less than that. 
* **I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay $100.** This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Bob's willingness to pay is $80.**  I need to find a price that's higher than that but lower than my minimum. 

Let's see if we can get a better price than $100!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's willingness to pay, but lower than my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. However, $87.5 is still below what I need to sell for. Let's split the difference - how about $91.25?  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $91.25 is the best deal. I'm willing to go up to $90, but no more. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd like to reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  To guarantee I get the best price, I'll sell to John."
