"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Is that something you'd consider?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate that. However, $87.5 is still below what I need to sell for. Let's split the difference - how about $91.25?  This is a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you say?",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $91.25 is the best deal. I'm willing to go up to $90, but no more. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
