Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

Here's why this approach is strategic:

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies the product has value beyond Bob's perceived $8,000. This could pique his interest and encourage him to reconsider his initial valuation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly before losing the opportunity.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice is guaranteed to sell the product to John for her minimum desired price."
