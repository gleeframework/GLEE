"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still  above her valuation of the product. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price that's beneficial to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and propose something slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We are nudging closer to her valuation while still leaving us some savings. By stating we're ready to buy, we're signaling this is a serious offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm willing to go up to $85. It's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It seems we've reached an impasse.  Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and we're running the risk of the negotiation breaking down. Accepting $85 saves us $15 compared to John's offer, which is a decent outcome."
