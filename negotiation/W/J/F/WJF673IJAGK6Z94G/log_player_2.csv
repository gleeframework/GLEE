**Reasoning:**

It's always good to see if you can get a better price. Since you have 10 rounds and Alice has expressed enthusiasm, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue exploring if you can get a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $12,000.  You're still saving money compared to John's offer, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I can do a bit better than that. How about $13500? It's a small increase, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
