Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **Fairness:** It starts with the product's true value to Bob, demonstrating you understand the market.
* **Openness:** The message invites a conversation, showing you're open to negotiation.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you'll get at least $1,000,000.

This approach allows for potential profit if Bob is willing to pay more, while guaranteeing your minimum desired price."
