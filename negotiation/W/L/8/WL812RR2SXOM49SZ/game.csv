"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
