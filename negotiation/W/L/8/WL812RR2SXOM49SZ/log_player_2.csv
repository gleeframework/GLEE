"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that will surely bring you immense value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's a good starting point, but I want to try and negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get a better price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,050,000 is within my budget and a reasonable price.  There's always a risk that I might be able to negotiate a lower price in future rounds, but accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for a good price and avoids the risk of going over my budget or having Alice reject my counteroffer."
