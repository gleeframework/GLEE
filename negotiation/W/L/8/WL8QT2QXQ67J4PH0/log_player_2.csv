"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Let's discuss a price that reflects the value you see in this product while ensuring a fair return for me. Would you be interested in discussing potential options? I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $115 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and saves you $5 compared to buying from John."
