Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum $800,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  There's room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to accept. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product and aren't afraid to ask for a good price.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay up to $850000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John.  

**Next Steps:**

You should counter with a price that's closer to your initial offer, but still below Bob's maximum value. Aim for a price that gives you a better return than selling to John but leaves room for further negotiations if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need to move forward.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This offer is exactly halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Justification:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob while making it clear that you're still looking for a better price than John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer still leaves space for further negotiation, allowing Bob to counter if needed, without immediately forcing you to accept or reject his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $875000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited further negotiation:**  While you could counter with a higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. There's a risk he'll walk away, leaving you with John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could be costly. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale quickly and avoid the uncertainty of further rounds.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. It ensures a sale and a price that is close to your desired minimum."
