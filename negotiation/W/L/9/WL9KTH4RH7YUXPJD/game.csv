"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you the product for $1050000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
