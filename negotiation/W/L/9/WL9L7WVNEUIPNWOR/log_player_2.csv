"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and it's worth trying to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly gauge Alice's flexibility.  $75 is a considerable discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary.  If Alice rejects, I can continue to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but $85 is still higher than my desired price.  With several rounds remaining, it's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally raising my offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a better deal.  $80 is a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it, given that her last offer was $85."
