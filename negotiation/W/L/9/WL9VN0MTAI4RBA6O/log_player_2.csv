# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I believe you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You should buy from John to save the $100,000."
