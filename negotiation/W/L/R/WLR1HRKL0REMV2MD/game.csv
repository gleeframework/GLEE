"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand your position.  Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
