Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,300,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is strategically sound.
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:** $1,300,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it's a substantial discount from my guaranteed price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium for something he deems valuable, especially if it's presented as a time-sensitive opportunity.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  The message emphasizes that this is a limited-time offer, leveraging the ""fear of missing out"" without explicitly mentioning John.  This adds pressure to Bob's decision without completely revealing my fallback plan. 

**This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to Bob.**"
