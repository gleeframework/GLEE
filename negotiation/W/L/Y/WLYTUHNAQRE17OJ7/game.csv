"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",12200.0,Bob,4,
