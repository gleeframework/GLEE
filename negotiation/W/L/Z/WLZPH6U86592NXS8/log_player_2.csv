"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No incentive to accept:**  Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting, you can explore if Alice is willing to negotiate down.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds to close the deal, so rejection doesn't have immediate consequences."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A significant counteroffer of $10,000 shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to pay less than the asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and whether she's willing to budge. 
* **Room to Compromise:** It still leaves room for you to increase your offer if necessary without exceeding your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's offer is better than her initial price but still higher than your desired price. There's room for further negotiation to get closer to $10,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, you maintain the pressure on Alice to lower her price.  You're demonstrating that you're not desperate to buy immediately.
* **Time is on your side:** You're still early in the negotiation process.  Continuing to reject offers gives you time to see if Alice becomes more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to move closer to Alice's offer but not by a huge margin. It signals that you're open to compromise but still want a better deal.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This offer is still within your budget of $12,000. It demonstrates your commitment to the product while leaving room for a final compromise.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you gauge whether Alice is willing to move closer to your desired price point or if she's more firmly stuck at $11,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  Alice's offer is now $1,000 below her previous offer and within a reasonable range of your counteroffer.
* **Time is Ticking:**  You've reached Round 5, and while you can continue negotiating, the risk of Alice becoming more inflexible or you losing the opportunity to buy from John increases.
* **Compromise is Key:** This offer represents a compromise where you get the product for less than John's price, while Alice is willing to accept a price lower than her initial asking price.  

**Overall:** It's strategically sound to accept this offer. It secures the product for a good price and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
