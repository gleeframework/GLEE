"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
