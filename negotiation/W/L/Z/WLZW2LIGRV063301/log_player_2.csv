"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get the product for less than $1,000,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good deal for me. It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John, and I'm confident that I can get a good return on investment even with this price. Accepting the offer is the best course of action."
