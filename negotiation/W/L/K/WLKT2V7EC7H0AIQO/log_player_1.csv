Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,200,000, ensuring you won't go below that price. 

**The Offer:**
Offering the product at $1,400,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees while leaving him with a potential gain ($100,000). This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, leading to a higher profit than selling to John."
