"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Alice,5,
