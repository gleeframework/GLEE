Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice!  That's a nice product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'd prefer. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I can go a bit higher, how about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
