"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000, which is $50000 less than my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
