"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  That would make it a really good deal for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
