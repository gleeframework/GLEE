I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy with the $10,000, I believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still confident the product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to meet you halfway. This would still give us both a good deal. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 12000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my ideal value. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also willing to buy for $10,000."
