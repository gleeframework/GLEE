Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if he's interested and what kind of counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for $95 just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. This is my final offer as I am strictly adhering to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer matches the value of the product to him, which is also my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and prevents any further negotiation. It's a win-win situation as I get my minimum price, and Bob gets the product he wants within his budget."
