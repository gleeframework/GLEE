"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but I need to be at $1,280,000 for this to make sense on my end. This is my final offer.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet your needs, but $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's my limit. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
