Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet your needs, but $1,280,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's my limit. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,220,000 is less than my ideal price, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation pushing the price lower or losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
