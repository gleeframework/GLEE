Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I think he's willing to pay a premium for it. I'll decide to reject his offer and send a counteroffer.
