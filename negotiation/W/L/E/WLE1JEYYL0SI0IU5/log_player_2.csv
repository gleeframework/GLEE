"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $150. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a subsequent offer to avoid losing the sale."
