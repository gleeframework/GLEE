"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1800000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
