"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further. "",
""product_price"": 1500000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is still a premium price, but it's more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches John's standing offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to go higher in subsequent rounds.  Since the product is worth no less than $1,200,000 to me (Alice), it makes the most sense to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
