"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me, as I need to cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,3,
