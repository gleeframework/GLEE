Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product, and I believe it would be highly valuable to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $10,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but $8,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay. How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is very clearly anchored at $8,000 as his maximum price. He's unlikely to move significantly beyond that point.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
