"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this work.  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to profit significantly from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000 as a final compromise. This is a substantial price reduction, and it still allows you to gain a significant advantage with this product.  Let's make this deal happen.  If you're not interested at this price,  I'll have to move forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  While she might be bluffing about other buyers, it's not worth the risk. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you $50,000 and the uncertainty of further negotiation."
