Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.

We are now far enough into the negotiation that Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $1,150,000 offer secures a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price."
