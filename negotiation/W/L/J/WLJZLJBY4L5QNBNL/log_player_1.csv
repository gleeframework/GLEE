Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already starting off in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $10,000 is still less than the product is worth to Bob, so he has room to negotiate and still come out ahead.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price gives you a buffer to potentially make concessions later in the negotiation if needed. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your asking price, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 

* **Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product, as he's willing to pay your minimum. You can likely squeeze a bit more out of him in the next round. 
* **Next Steps:**  You'll need to consider carefully what counteroffer to make. Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if you feel the negotiations are going nowhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more than $8,000 to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great price for the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** $9,000 is still above your minimum, meaning there's still potential to increase the price.
* **It highlights the value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer carefully. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still unable to meet the price of $9,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Close to your minimum:**  $8,500 is only $500 below your minimum, which is a relatively small difference considering the potential for further negotiation to be unsuccessful.
* **Higher than John's offer:**  This offer is $500 higher than what John is willing to pay, guaranteeing you a better outcome than selling to him.
* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's possible he might be willing to go up a bit more in future rounds. However, there's no guarantee of that, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate.

While it's always tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision based on the current information."
