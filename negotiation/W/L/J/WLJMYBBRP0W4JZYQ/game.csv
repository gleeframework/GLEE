"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value for your money.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $108? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $108 still falls short of what I need to get.  Let's split the difference and settle on $110. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. My final offer is $107. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to walk away.",107.0,Bob,6,
