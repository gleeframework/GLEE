"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** This first offer serves as a gauge for Bob's eagerness and potential flexibility in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We're aware of John's standing offer, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't proceed favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's very interested but trying to secure a more favorable price.  We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've lowered our price by $50,000, showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $1,000,000, we keep a high reference point, hoping to influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:** Framing the compromise as ""fair"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a move closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 represents a substantial profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Both sides have made concessions, and this price feels like a fair compromise after multiple rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal."
