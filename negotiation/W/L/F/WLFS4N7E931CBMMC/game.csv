"I understand you're interested in the product, but $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think it's worth a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $825,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $787,500 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $812,500.",812500.0,Alice,7,
