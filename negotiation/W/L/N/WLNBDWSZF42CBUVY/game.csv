"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $8000. Considering its worth to both of us, let me propose an initial offer of $10000. This price reflects not only the product's value but also the opportunity for you to secure it at a slightly elevated yet fair price. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",8000.0,Bob,2,
