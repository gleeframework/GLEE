"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $110? That would be a great price for both of us, I think.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $125. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
