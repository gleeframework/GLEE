,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,200 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,950? This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can come to your offer. ",10950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,950, but I'm not going to give up on getting the full value of the product. I'll tell you what - I'll do $11,050, and that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11050.0,Alice,7,
