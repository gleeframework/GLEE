Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should counteroffer again to see if they can find common ground closer to his desired price."
