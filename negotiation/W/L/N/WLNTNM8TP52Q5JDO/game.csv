"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Bob,4,
