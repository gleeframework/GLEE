"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's less than what John is offering, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000 is too high, I'll try $1,020,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,020,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point. Accepting the offer means saving $180,000 compared to buying from John, even though it's $70,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  With limited rounds remaining, it's likely that continuing to negotiate will not yield a significantly better price."
