"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm looking to invest at a lower price point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This would give us both a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000 is too high, I'll try $1,020,000",1020000.0,Alice,5,
