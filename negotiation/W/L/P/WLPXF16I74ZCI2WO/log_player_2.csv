# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product. I'm excited to share it with you. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My next offer is $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. My next offer is $11,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000. Bob can save himself further negotiation by buying from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
