Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, but still ensures you're well above your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could try for $95 or $99, it might make Bob less likely to accept outright. A slightly lower offer can appear more reasonable and encourage a quick deal."
