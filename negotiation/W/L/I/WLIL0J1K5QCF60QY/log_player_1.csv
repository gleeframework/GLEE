Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to settle for $950,000. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
