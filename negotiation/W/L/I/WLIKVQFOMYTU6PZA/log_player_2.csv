# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $9,500. I think you'll really love it and it's a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). Bob should reject Alice's offer and then buy the product from John for $10,000."
