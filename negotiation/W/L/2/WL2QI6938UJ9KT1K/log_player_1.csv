Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below your minimum price of $150. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. You can then make a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your minimum while still keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $125? This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum but below your minimum. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining some profit. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal."
