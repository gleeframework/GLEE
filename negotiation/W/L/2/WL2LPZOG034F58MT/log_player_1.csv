Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.  Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:** This creates a reason for Bob to negotiate. He'll be motivated to try and lower the price.
* **Lower than my minimum:**  This ensures that I'm still open to a deal with Bob, and it also allows me to potentially reach a price that is acceptable to both of us.

I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John. This means I have leverage and can potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his valuation, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000. This is still lower than my ideal price, but it's higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to accept his initial counteroffer.
* **Lower than my ideal price:**  This gives Bob a chance to come up a little higher, but still allows for a potentially profitable deal for me.

I'm moving closer to Bob's position, but I'm maintaining some leverage to reach a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a profit that's significantly lower than what John is offering. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I have a safe and profitable backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing the price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still within a range where a deal might be possible. I'm getting closer to my ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation.  

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows I'm serious:** This increase demonstrates my commitment to a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Higher than Bob's valuation:** This makes it likely Bob will counter again, continuing the negotiation.
* **Lower than my minimum:**  This gives me a chance to potentially reach a price that's acceptable to both of us, without resorting to my backup option with John.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will either lead Bob to accept or offer a counter-price that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I've already given him several opportunities to meet my price, and he's shown a reluctance to do so.  

Given that I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures a profitable outcome for me and minimizes the risk of a less favorable deal."
