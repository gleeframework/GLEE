Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be making a decent profit.
