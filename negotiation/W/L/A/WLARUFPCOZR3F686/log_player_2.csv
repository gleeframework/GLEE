"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

It's always a good idea to start by trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's first offer opens the door to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that. I could be willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000, but that's my best offer at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting closer, but $1,125,000 is still too high.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be making a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
