"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that. I could be willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000, but that's my best offer at this time.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $1,100,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'd still be making a decent profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
