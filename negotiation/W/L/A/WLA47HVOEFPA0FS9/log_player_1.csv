Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** There's a $250,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, which allows for negotiation without risking losing the deal entirely.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffer is too low, as I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I will try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still acknowledging Bob's financial constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer but below my initial offer, balancing my need for profit with the possibility of closing the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on reaching a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll consider offering a further compromise or potentially walking away to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000. I really think this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. Accepting it would mean sacrificing a significant portion of my potential profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I will try to find a compromise closer to my minimum acceptable value but also acknowledge Bob's willingness to meet halfway. I will aim for a price around $1,200,000.  If Bob rejects this final offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you almost halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while respecting your budget constraints. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob. I'm offering a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Firm but Fair:** While $1,200,000 is still above Bob's current offer, it shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I'm confident this final offer will be enough to entice Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  It seems like we've reached an impasse. 

**Next Steps:**

I've exhausted my negotiation efforts with Bob and am not willing to compromise any further.  I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000, ensuring I get my desired value for the product."
