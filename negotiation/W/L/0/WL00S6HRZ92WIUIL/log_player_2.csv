"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $13000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially losing the deal entirely isn't worth the potential savings.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
