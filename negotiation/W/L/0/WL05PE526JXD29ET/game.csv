"Alice, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is fair for both of us. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
