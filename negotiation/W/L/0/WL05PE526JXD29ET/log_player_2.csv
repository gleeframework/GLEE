Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is fair for both of us. If we can agree on this price, we can close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 800000}
