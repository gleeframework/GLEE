"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $16000?  This would give me a fair price and allow you to stay within your budget.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14000? This would allow me to get your product without going over budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
