"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob, even though it's worth more to me. This can make him more inclined to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to Bob while still being profitable for me.  I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel I can reach a satisfactory price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is a clear indication that he's interested in the product, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I know that Bob is willing to pay something, and I want to see if I can find a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still allows for some room for negotiation. I'll also continue to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This would still give you a good price on a product that you'll love."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $110 to $95.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This demonstrates a fair and reasonable approach. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation open and collaborative.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, as I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $80. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Insistence:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer of $80, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  While Bob hasn't budged much, I believe there's still potential for a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, this time with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's. I'll emphasize that this is my final offer and that I'm willing to walk away if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this work, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down one last time to $90. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, indicating that I am serious about getting as close to my minimum price as possible.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate that this is a good deal for Bob, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Clear Consequence:** I've stated a clear consequence of rejection â€“ moving on to another buyer. This adds pressure to Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by lowering the price again.  However, I'm hoping that the finality of this offer, coupled with the emphasis on value and the potential for lost opportunity, will persuade Bob to agree.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John and accept a lower profit."
