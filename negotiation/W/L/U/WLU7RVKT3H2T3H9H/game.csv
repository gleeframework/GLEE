"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's my final offer. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
