I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a fair compromise between my minimum price ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($12,000).  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer.  It's close enough to my minimum price of $8,000 that I'm willing to accept it. It's better to secure the sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer."
