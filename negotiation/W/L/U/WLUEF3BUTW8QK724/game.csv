"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. This takes into account the significant value it will bring to your operations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring it down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $925,000. Would that work for you?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to $975,000, but that's as low as I can go.",975000.0,Alice,5,
