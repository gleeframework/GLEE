We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are now at $975,000. It's unlikely we'll get much closer to $1,000,000, and we still risk him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
