"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify a price of $1200000. I'd like to offer $800000 for the product. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price based on similar products in the market.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your research, Bob. I appreciate your candor. However, I believe the product's value is higher than what you've offered. Considering the unique features and benefits it provides, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price that works for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is the right price for the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. I think this is a fair price based on my research and analysis, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
