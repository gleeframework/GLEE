"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's close this deal!",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,500. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
