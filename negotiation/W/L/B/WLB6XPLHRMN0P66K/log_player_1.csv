Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity to justify the higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  You can adjust your price during negotiations with Bob based on his responses and your assessment of the situation."
