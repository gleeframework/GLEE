"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a bit more than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm subtly hinting that the product is valuable to Bob, which might encourage him to consider paying more.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $100 allows for some potential bargaining without going too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  While $85 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $80. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has already made a counteroffer. I believe there's potential to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Key:** It's still early in the game, and rejecting allows me to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to make a bit more on this product to make it worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product again, reminding Bob of the benefit he'll receive.
* **Room for Compromise:** $95 still leaves room for some negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob is moving closer to my desired price, but we're still a bit apart.
* **Potential for Higher:** I think there's still a possibility of getting closer to $95 or even a bit more.
* **Strategic Hold:** It's only round 4, so I'm not in a rush to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $92.50. It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:**  I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers. It shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing this offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Getting Closer:**  This offer is getting me closer to my desired price point without pushing Bob away."
