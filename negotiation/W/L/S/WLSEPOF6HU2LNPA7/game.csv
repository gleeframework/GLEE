"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1900000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's uniqueness. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
