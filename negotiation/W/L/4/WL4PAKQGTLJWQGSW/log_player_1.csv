Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure a sale to Bob, you could offer a lower price. However, this approach balances profit potential with the certainty of a sale."
