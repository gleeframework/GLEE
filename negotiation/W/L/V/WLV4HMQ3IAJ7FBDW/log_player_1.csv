Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiation, as it allows for room to compromise. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, as he's still getting a deal at this price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have another buyer willing to pay $100, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial $110 offer. It's still above Bob's offer of $90, but it's getting closer to a price that might be acceptable to him.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable middle ground and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to make a bit more than $95, it's now getting too close to the price John is offering.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed $100 sale with John."
