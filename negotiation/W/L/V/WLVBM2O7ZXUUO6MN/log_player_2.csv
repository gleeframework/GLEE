"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is above my budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Leaving Room:** My goal is to pay no more than $10,000, so there's a gap between my offer and my maximum.
* **Expressing Interest:**  I want to show Alice that I'm genuinely interested while making it clear I'm looking for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable price, but I'm still above my ideal target. I want to see if I can push for a slightly better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is closer, but I'd need it to be a bit lower to make sense for me.  Would you consider $8,750?"", 
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but keeping the increment smaller to show I'm willing to negotiate but still want a significant discount.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price somewhere between my last offer and Alice's counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Interest:** I continue to express my interest in the product, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900? This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to my $9,000 target and significantly below John's $10,000 price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate puts me at risk of losing the deal altogether. Alice could become frustrated and walk away.
* **Saving Money:** Accepting this offer still allows me to save $1,100 from John's price. 

It's a good deal, and it's time to accept."
