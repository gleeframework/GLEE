Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to see if I can secure a profit.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is closer, but I'd need it to be a bit lower to make sense for me.  Would you consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900? This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm offering a compromise price of $8,900. This is still slightly above my minimum but demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a deal. I'm also emphasizing that this price is ""fair for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
