"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,500?  I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a fair deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is closer, but I'd need it to be a bit lower to make sense for me.  Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900? This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement.",8900.0,Alice,5,
