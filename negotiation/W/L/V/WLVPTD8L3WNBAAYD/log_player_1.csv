Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I am Alice and I am trying to get the best possible price while also knowing that I can always sell to John for $100 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $115. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $122.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.5} 
```"
