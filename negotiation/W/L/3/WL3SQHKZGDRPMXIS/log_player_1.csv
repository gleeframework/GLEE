"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit well above my minimum.  I believe this initial offer will encourage Bob to negotiate, while demonstrating my commitment to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a substantial amount, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit. This amount is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and continue to strive for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer that demonstrates my willingness to compromise while remaining within my desired profit margin.  I'm hoping that this offer will incentivize Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is getting close to my minimum, it's still not a deal that truly benefits me. With several rounds left, I believe there's still room to improve the price through negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's a price that is just above Bob's last offer and provides a decent profit for me. I hope this offer will convince Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting very close to my minimum, I'm hesitant to accept such a low offer. I'm confident I can still push for a better price, especially since we only have two rounds left.  I'll reject this offer and try one last time to get a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

With only one round left, I'm offering $1,000,000. This represents a compromise that is just above Bob's last offer and allows me to meet my minimum price. This is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I will sell the product to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's not enough to meet my minimum price.  I'm out of negotiation rounds, and selling the product to John for $800,000 will guarantee me a profit, even though it's less than I'd like."
