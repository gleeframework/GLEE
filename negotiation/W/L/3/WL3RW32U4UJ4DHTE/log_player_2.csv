"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is too high, and there are more rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's closer to his ideal value ($8,000).  A counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while also staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original price. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. There are still rounds left, so rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer, but still staying below his maximum budget. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially secure a deal."
