"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1500000 is at the top of my budget. To make this work, I'd need to come in at $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value I've placed on this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. To make this work for me, I need to stay at $1250000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute limit of my budget. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $1,250,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.
