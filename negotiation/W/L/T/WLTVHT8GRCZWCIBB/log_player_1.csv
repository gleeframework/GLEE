Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good but the price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good price for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
