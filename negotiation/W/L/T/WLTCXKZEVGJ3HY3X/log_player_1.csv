Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below your minimum ($1,000,000) knowing you have another buyer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
