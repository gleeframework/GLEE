Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum acceptable value ($12,000).
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the benefit for both parties. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Bob may counteroffer, allowing for a potential deal.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $12,000 is guaranteed, there's a chance I could secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing fairness and a win-win scenario for both parties.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to accept, reminding him of the potential for the deal to fall through. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a firm but flexible stance:** I'm not giving in to Bob's initial offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Increase the likelihood of a deal:**  By presenting a compromise, I'm making the deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Keep my options open:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm really interested in making a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  There's very little room for further negotiation, and continuing to bargain with Bob risks further reducing the price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of getting a lower price from Bob is too high.  Selling to John offers a guaranteed and more secure outcome."
