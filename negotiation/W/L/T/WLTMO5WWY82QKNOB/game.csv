"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello again Bob, I appreciate your response.  While I understand your perspective, the $600,000 offer significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this revised price reflects the product's unique value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to go. How about $800,000?  That's my best offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand where you're coming from, but the gap between our valuations is substantial. To be frank, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.  To make this work with you, I need you to meet me closer to that figure. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about my limit. If you can do $900,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible, but this negotiation is reaching a critical point. I have a standing offer for $1,500,000, and that's a figure I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to make one final offer to you: $1,400,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If it doesn't work for you, I wish you the best in your search.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
