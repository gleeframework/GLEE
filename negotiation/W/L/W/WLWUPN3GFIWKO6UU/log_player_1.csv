"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I believe it holds immense value and would significantly benefit you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000, considering its potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value"" and ""potential"", Alice aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The significant gap between the initial offer and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) provides ample space for negotiation over the remaining rounds.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John as Backup:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,500,000). If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can walk away and accept John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, Alice needs to balance securing a good price with the risk of running out of rounds and losing both Bob and John's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is beyond my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my ability to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice signals that she's looking for a better deal. This sets the stage for further negotiation and counteroffers in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and present your counterproposal. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, I believe my initial offer was more in line with its true potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement (but Gradual):** Alice is showing flexibility by decreasing her price, but the reduction is substantial enough to not appear desperate. 
* **Reiterating Value:** Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's high potential value, subtly anchoring his perception higher than his initial offer.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer still leaves space for further negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he can work towards a price closer to his desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still more than I can afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a willingness to make a deal. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum.
* **Time Constraint:** With six rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob, especially if he's feeling pressured. Accepting now secures a favorable price without jeopardizing the deal."
