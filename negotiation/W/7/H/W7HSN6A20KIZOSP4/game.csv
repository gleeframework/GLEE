"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a great investment for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, given the potential of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to me. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're getting closer to my desired price.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
