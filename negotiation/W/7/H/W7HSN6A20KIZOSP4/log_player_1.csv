{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a great investment for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price, and I have 8 more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering John's offer as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, given the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to me. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 more rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, but I want to see if I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're getting closer to my desired price.  However, $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
