"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is way too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $80 for your product.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $110.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to buy from John instead.",100.0,Bob,6,
