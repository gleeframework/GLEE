Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks promising, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price of $600,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be frank, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $950,000 is still too high for me. My final offer is $800,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now hit his maximum valuation of $800,000.  It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
