"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is halfway between Alice's offer and his maximum. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within Bob's price range and is a good deal considering he's already rejected one offer. While it might be possible to negotiate further, accepting now minimizes the risk of the deal falling through or having to buy from John at a higher price."
