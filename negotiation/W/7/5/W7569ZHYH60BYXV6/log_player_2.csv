"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Even if Alice won't budge, you've gained information and aren't locked into her initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm starting with a significant discount to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a good starting point, and we'll adjust depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a bit high. I want to see if I can push her lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm going to offer $130. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's offer. If she rejects, we'll have to see if we can get closer to a deal or if I should just go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price. It's worth accepting this offer and saving $15 compared to John's offer."
