"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, and I'm prepared to pay $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is too low, especially considering I can sell to John for $1,000,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our need to come to an agreement. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a deal, and I appreciate that.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm getting closer to your price, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal and call it a day. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I've already rejected several of his offers. Continuing to negotiate may not yield a better outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
