Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $120 (John's offer).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $150 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to an immediate rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer."
