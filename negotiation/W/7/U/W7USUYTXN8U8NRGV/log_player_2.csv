"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is an exceptional value at $1,250,000. This is a special opportunity to secure such a high-quality item at a competitive price. We look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,250,000 is still too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To find common ground, I propose a price of $1,100,000. This allows for a reasonable profit while still offering you a substantial savings compared to the original asking price. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He can save $400,000 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or needing to buy from John.  Accepting the offer is the most strategic move at this point."
