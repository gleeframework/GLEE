Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
