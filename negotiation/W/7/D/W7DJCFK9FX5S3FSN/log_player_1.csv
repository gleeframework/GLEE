Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $12,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, you have leverage.  You can aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a safety net. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away immediately.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target:** Starting at $14,000 aims for a price above your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message presents the price confidently, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. You could gradually lower the price, but never going below your $12,000 minimum.

**Important:**  Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to you. Remember, you have John as a reliable backup buyer."
