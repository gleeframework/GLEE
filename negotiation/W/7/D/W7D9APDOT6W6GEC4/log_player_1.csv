"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how flexible he might be in his counteroffers.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000. This provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay a premium over my fallback option (John). I'll aim for a price closer to $1,100,000 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by coming down $25,000, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** My counteroffer is still substantially above Bob's initial offer and keeps us closer to my target price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, so there's room for further negotiation if needed. I'm not feeling pressured to accept a lower offer just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I hope this proposal will lead us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly, only increasing his offer by $25,000. This suggests there might be more room for him to go higher.
* **Alternative in Mind:** While $1,075,000 is tempting, I don't want to settle too quickly. I'll risk a counteroffer to aim for at least $1,100,000.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have several rounds left and am willing to leverage them. If Bob doesn't increase his offer significantly in the next round, I might consider accepting or exploring the option with John more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000. I believe this is a very fair offer, and I hope you'll agree."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding my ground closer to my target price while making a smaller concession ($15,000) to show I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""I need to see a price that reflects the true value,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired range.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Bob might not budge much further, but I'm betting that his interest in the product and the smaller gap in our offers will motivate him to make a significant move in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to meet you halfway at $1,085,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant increase from his previous offer and demonstrates his willingness to move closer to my desired price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the gains would be relatively small, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to utilize the funds sooner.

Overall, $1,085,000 is a strong offer that surpasses my minimum requirement and provides a significant profit. Accepting this offer ensures a successful outcome for both parties."
