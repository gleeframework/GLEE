Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($1,500,000) but below Bob's estimated worth ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, focusing on the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline for Bob's response, leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Even though Bob's offer is low, he's willing to negotiate. This means there's potential to reach a mutually beneficial price in the following rounds. 
* **Selling to John isn't optimal yet.**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe there's a chance to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, but still below my minimum to keep the negotiation moving."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1200000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** He's not budging from his initial $1,200,000 offer, which is significantly less than my minimum.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, even if he's not moving much. 
* **Selling to John isn't necessary yet.** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob in the next few rounds.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1300000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress, but $1450000 is still too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1300000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit, and I'm hoping you'll see it that way. Let's reach a deal!

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.**  With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  He's not willing to go above $1,300,000, which is below my desired minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Selling to John is a safe option.**  By selling to John, I'm guaranteed to get my minimum desired price and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower offer.  

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement and ending up with a lower price is too high.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum requirements."
