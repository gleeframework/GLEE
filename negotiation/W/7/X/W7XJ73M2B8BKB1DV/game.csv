"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great price considering its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also trying to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 simply doesn't reflect its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures we both get what we need out of this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for the product, considering my budget constraints. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $10,000 and $10,750?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, and I'm trying to be fair. But $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,625? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10625.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I believe $10,500 would be the most reasonable price for the product. Could we agree on this amount?",10500.0,Bob,6,
