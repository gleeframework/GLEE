Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, as that's its fair market value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, the value of this product extends beyond its perceived market worth. It holds unique advantages that justify a premium.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant step up from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 5

{
""message"": ""Bob, you've made a compelling case, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,225,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer.  While I value this product, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,162,500. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could continue negotiating and try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, his offer is now significantly above our fallback option with John. Accepting this offer locks in a very good profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling apart with further haggling."
