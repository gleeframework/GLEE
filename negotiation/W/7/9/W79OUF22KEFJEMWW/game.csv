"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a number. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Bob.  While $1,050,000 is closer to a realistic price, I can't accept anything less than $1,250,000. This product is worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will pay dividends for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a firm budget.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
