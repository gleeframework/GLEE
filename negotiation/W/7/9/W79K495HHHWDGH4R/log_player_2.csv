"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is within his budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80). By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a little less. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $92.50 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $91.25. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above the product's worth to her. There are still rounds left, so it's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $91.25 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $89? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $91.25 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $90. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $90.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $90.50 is close to Bob's counteroffer of $89 and still within Bob's budget of $100.  With only three rounds remaining, it's likely Alice won't go any lower. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
