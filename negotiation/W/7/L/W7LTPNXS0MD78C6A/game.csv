"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we're still far apart on price. While $11,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000 to try and reach a deal.  What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for coming up on the price.  I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
