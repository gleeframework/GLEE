Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a strategic move for Alice:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob some incentive to buy, as he'll make a profit.
* **It's lower than Alice's valuation:** This ensures Alice still gets a good deal and earns a significant profit.
* **It's lower than John's valuation:** This ensures that if Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at a higher price.

This offer balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a slightly higher profit than simply selling to John."
