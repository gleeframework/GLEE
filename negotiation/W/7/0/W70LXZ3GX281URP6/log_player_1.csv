Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price slightly if needed. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a little to $100.  It's a great deal for you, and still a good price for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to try and entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my $120 threshold. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm choosing to reject the offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm trying to find a compromise point that works for both of us.  I'm also reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120 yet. I'm still hopeful that we can find a price that works for both of us, and I'm going to continue negotiating."

``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly again, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I'm also reminding Bob that we're close to a deal and that this is a great opportunity for him."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $120. While we're getting closer, there's only a few rounds left. I don't want to risk losing out on a sure $120 from John. Therefore, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John."
