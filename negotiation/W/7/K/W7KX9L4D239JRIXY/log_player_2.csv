{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by 20%. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away. I want to gauge her response and see if she's open to a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but $90 is still above my target. I'll reject and continue to negotiate. I want to push for a price closer to my $80 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $85. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, while still staying within my budget.  I'm aiming for a middle ground between her previous offer and my initial counteroffer."
