# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $400,000."
