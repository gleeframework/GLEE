Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive and won't be available for long."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a significant profit over John's offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer ($1,400,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also anchors the price in his mind at a higher point than if we started lower.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, we know we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, meeting our minimum price."
