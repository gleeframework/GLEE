Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  While $1,600,000 is a tempting price, I can't quite justify it in my budget. My absolute final offer is $1,450,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I receive my baseline value for the product without further negotiation."
