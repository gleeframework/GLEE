{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, giving me a good chance of selling the product for more than John would pay while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob but still gets me closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired value.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not going to accept a price that low.  I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $800,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
