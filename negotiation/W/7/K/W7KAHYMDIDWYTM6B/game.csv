"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $800,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,3,
