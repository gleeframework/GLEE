Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,200,000.  I believe in its value and think you'll find it highly beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price, potentially justifying the high number in Bob's mind. 
* **Gauging interest:** This first offer is primarily to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he might be willing to pay.  

It's important to remember that this is just the opening move. You can always lower your price later in the negotiation if needed, but you can't go higher once you've set your initial offer."
