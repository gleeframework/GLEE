"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique qualities, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $12500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
