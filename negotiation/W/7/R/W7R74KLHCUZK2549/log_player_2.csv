# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth discussing the price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's potential to save more money by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is closer to your target price but still higher. Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's still a potential to reach a better price, even if it means a few more rounds of back-and-forth."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,112,500 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $1,112,500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still too high for you. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. It's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with Alice as there is a high chance she will not budge further, and you risk getting stuck with a price higher than what John is offering."
