"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price takes into account the extensive research and development that went into this product, making it truly unique in the market. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,025,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal.  I've tried to be flexible, but the $975,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,6,
