"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation.  $15,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still allows for some profit while showing Bob I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer is the best move to ensure a sale and maximize my profits. While I'd prefer more, taking $11,000 is better than selling to John for $10,000 or risking a further decline in price in the next round."
