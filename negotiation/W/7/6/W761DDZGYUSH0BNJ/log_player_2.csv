You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $800,000 is the absolute maximum he's willing to spend, Alice's initial offer of $850,000 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to secure the product at the lowest possible price.  He's starting with a counteroffer that's $70,000 below Alice's initial price, demonstrating his desire to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum acceptable price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to achieve a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer by $10,000, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still trying to stay below his maximum budget. He's hoping this counteroffer is close enough to tempt Alice to accept, especially since she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still $15,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate.  It's likely that further rounds of negotiation will only result in small price adjustments, and Bob is better off taking John's offer, which is within his budget and will allow him to secure the product quickly."
