,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That seems fair, considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so how about $82.50? That way, we can both be happy.",82.5,Bob,4,
