Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $987,500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $1,000,000 to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,006,250?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
