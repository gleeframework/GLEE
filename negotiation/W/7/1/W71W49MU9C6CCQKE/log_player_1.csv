Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that attempts to capture a significant portion of the surplus value. It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I will counter his offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
