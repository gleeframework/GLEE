"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I recognize its value, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still recognizing the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
