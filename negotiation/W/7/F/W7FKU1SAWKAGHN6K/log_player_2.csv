# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget while still recognizing the product's worth. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this price.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still a bit high. You can likely get closer to $1,000,000 with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

Alice is now unwilling to go lower than $1,075,000. This is still above your desired price, and while further negotiation is possible, it's likely to be time-consuming and uncertain.  It's more efficient and less risky to purchase the product from John for your target price of $1,000,000."
