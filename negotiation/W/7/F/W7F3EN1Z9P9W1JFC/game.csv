"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is my top offer, as I'm sure you understand.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but unfortunately, that's still a bit higher than I'm able to go.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  It's my maximum budget, and I truly believe this product is worth it.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
