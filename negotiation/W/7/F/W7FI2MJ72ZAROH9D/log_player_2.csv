{""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that is close to Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This shows I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to increase my offer if necessary, as my maximum budget is $15,000.
