"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1250000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1250000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000. However, that's still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1300000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1320000.
