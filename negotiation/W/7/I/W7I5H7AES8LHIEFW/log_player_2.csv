"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value to both of us. I understand its worth to you is $800,000. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both parties. I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to maximize my savings. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. This price still represents a fair value for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. To ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing a price of $725,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin while maintaining the value for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $725,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting this offer still results in a $75,000 saving compared to buying from John.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to take longer and possibly reach a stalemate, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most practical choice for Bob."
