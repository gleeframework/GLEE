"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,500 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product, but your price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is my best offer, as it's still slightly above my maximum spending limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't sell it for less than $13,000. This product is in high demand, and I'm confident it's worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's unlikely Alice will go lower than that, as she's confident in the product's value. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price."
