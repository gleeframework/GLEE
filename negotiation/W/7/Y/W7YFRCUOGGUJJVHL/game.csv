"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your perspective.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we meet at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and respect your limit. Let's make this work. How about we settle at $1,110,000? This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels right while still reflecting the value I'm bringing to the table.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so how about we try $1,105,000? I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1105000.0,Bob,6,
