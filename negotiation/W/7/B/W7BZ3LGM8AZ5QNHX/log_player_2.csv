"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $140
* **Your maximum value:** $150
* **Your cost if you reject:** $150 (from John)

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum value and your cost if you reject, it's beneficial to accept her offer. You save $10 compared to buying from John."
