"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $8,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,800. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're still at $8,600. I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is my absolute bottom line. I really hope we can close this deal, but I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think.",8700.0,Alice,7,
