"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly less than my minimum ($10,000). This gives room for negotiation and shows I'm open to compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting that it's a ""great deal"" for both of us reinforces the potential benefits of the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product.
* **More Negotiation Potential:** I have 8 rounds left. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum, giving us a better chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides security. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the good value proposition for Bob at this price point. 
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm emphasizing collaboration and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer helps to move the negotiation closer to a possible agreement, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.
* **Further Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left, and with each round, the pressure on Bob to compromise increases. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially pushing us closer to a mutually agreeable point.
* **John Remains an Option:** Selling to John is still on the table. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can secure my minimum value by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. $8,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $8,800. That's a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only lowering my price by $200 this time, showing that I'm getting closer to my minimum but also that I'm not willing to drop too much further.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I highlight that this offer is a ""significant compromise"" to emphasize my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I use the phrase ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and justify the price I'm offering. 
* **Keep the Pressure On:**  The pressure is starting to mount for Bob. With fewer rounds remaining, his options are diminishing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below $8,800. How about $8,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.
* **Time is Running Out:** We only have 4 rounds left. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially pushing us closer to a mutually agreeable point.  
* **John is a Safe Bet:**  Selling to John is still an option. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can secure my minimum value by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close! I understand you're still at $8,600. I'm willing to go down to $8,700, which is my absolute bottom line. I really hope we can close this deal, but I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last significant price drop. I'm signaling that I'm serious about making a deal but won't go any lower. 
* **Emphasizing the Deal:** I remind Bob that we are close to closing the deal, adding pressure for him to accept. 
* **Bottom Line:** I clearly state that this is my absolute bottom line to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Urgency:**  By saying ""I really hope we can close this deal,"" I subtly suggest that if we don't reach an agreement soon, I might need to move on to other potential buyers (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,700, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We only have two rounds left.  It's unlikely that further negotiation with Bob will get us to a price I'm comfortable with, especially since he's still offering significantly below my minimum.
* **John Offers Security:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $10,000. This is a safe and secure option.
* **No More Room for Compromise:**  I've already made significant concessions. At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is high, and the potential reward is low. 

It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
