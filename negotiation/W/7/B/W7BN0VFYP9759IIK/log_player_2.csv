"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has immense potential to bring significant value to your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her desired price, but it's still within your budget. However, there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds to work with. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I agree this product has great potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still represent a significant profit for you, and it's within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,150,000, which is only $50,000 above your counteroffer.  This is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the price you would pay John. It's a fair compromise, and there's a good chance that further negotiation won't get you a much better price."
