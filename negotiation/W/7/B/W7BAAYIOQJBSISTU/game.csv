"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
