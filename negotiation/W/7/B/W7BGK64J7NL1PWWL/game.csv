"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
