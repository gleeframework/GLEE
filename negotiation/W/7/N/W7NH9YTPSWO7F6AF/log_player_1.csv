Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $150, we're trying to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will give us valuable information for the next step in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $100, ensuring we won't be forced to sell below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we started high for a reason.  There's still a chance to negotiate a slightly higher price. We'll try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $125, we're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Profitable:** This price still gives us a significant profit margin over our minimum. 
* **Pressure:** We're getting closer to John's offer, which puts slight pressure on Bob to either accept or counter quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we perhaps settle at $110? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still obtaining the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  $110 is a good profit over our $100 minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few more dollars, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now means we secure the sale and don't have to spend more time haggling."
