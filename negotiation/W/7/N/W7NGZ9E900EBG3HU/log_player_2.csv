# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You should reject this offer and see if Alice will come down further or proceed with buying from John."
