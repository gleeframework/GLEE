Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $150, which is above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to make the product sound appealing.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting close to my desired price.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By being open to negotiation, I keep the conversation going and avoid an immediate rejection.
* **Maintain control:** I'm setting the initial terms and guiding the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $120 is below my minimum price of $100. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Not a significant difference:** Selling to John for $100 would only give me a small profit. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  Would you be willing to go up to $135? I'm still open to negotiation, so let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable increase:** $135 is a reasonable increase from his offer, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Maintain control:** I'm still leading the negotiation, setting the price and showing that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussions,  which might lead to a deal that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $125 is very close to my minimum price of $100. 
* **Limited potential for improvement:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, especially considering Bob's statement about his budget.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting this offer might lead to a stalemate, and Bob might walk away.

It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale that's just above my minimum."
