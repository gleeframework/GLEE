Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
