``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than his maximum budget and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better deal."

Round 2

Round 3

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he still has a chance to get the product for $12,000 from John. He should try to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get the price down to $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
