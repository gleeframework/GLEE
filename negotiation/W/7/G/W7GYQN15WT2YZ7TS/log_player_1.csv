Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (You'll sell to John at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000 
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $2,000 (The difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. My asking price is $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message emphasizes value and confidence in the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 leaves Bob with a potential $500 gain, making it more likely he'll accept. This price also nets you a $1,500 profit over your John guarantee.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $11,000) to give room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.
