**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get closer to our initial offer, Bob has been firm at $1,200,000 for multiple rounds. This suggests he's unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit of $400,000. 

Continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Bob walking away:** He's clearly stated his limit, and pushing further might make him lose interest.
* **Losing the guaranteed $800,000 from John:**  The longer negotiations drag on, the higher the opportunity cost of not selling to John becomes.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical decision to maximize profit and minimize risk."
