"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $12,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair price to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a significant concession, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,5,
