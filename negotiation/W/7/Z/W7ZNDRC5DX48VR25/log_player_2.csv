Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.
