"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $16,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $16,500 is still a little higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $15,500?  That would be a good compromise and allow me to purchase the product.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer you a price of $17,000 for the product. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
