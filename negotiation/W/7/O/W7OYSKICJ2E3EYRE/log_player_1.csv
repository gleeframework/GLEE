Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is significantly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent amount. I'll think carefully about my next move.

Since Bob's offer is not too far off from my minimum price, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still reasonable. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1,200,000}

Let's see how Bob responds to this one!"
