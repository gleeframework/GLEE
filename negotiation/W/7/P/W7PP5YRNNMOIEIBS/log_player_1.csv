Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $950,000 is a solid profit. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and the risk of Bob walking away if I push too hard."
