"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand that $10000 is your current limit. Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
