"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. There's no reason to accept the initial offer since he can buy the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This aggressive approach might make Alice reconsider her position and potentially lead to a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a significant discount from her initial price and a good deal for Bob. There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower in the next rounds, and Bob can always buy from John if he's not satisfied with the deal.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John."
