"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to be closer to $700,000 to make it work. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and being upfront about your budget.  While $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?  This reflects the value I believe this product will bring to your business.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,450,000 is still a significant stretch for my current budget.  Could you consider something closer to $900,000?  I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within constraints.  Let's try this â€“ how about $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product brings. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
