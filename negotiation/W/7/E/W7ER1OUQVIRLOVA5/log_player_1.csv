Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to be closer to $700,000 to make it work. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,450,000 is still a significant stretch for my current budget.  Could you consider something closer to $900,000?  I'm eager to find a price point that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within constraints.  Let's try this â€“ how about $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value this product brings. "",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I could push for more, accepting $1,000,000 is a solid outcome at this point. It's a significant profit above Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
