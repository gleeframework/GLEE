Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob's estimated $12,000. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, aiming slightly higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
