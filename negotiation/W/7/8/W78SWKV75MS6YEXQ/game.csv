"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see that. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while remaining within my spending limit. Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still recognizes the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,105,000, which is a fair price for the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,105,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best price I can accept considering the product's value. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,7,
