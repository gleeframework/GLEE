Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,500 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to go down to $10,000 for a quick sale. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unlikely to go below $10,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save $2,000."
