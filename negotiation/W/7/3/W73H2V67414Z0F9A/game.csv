"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
