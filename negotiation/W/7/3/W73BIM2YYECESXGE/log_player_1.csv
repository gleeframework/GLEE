Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's above what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I think this will give Bob a sense that there's room for compromise, while still putting me in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm not going to give away the product for a significant discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no need to continue the negotiation. It's better to accept the offer and close the deal."
