Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,100,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, but I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the lowest she's willing to go.  Bob is close to his target price, and rejecting the offer risks further negotiation and the possibility that Alice will walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product for a price that's still significantly lower than John's offer."
