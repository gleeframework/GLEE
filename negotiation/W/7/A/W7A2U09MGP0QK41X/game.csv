"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a little lower than what I need.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,400?  That's just a small difference, and it would make a big difference for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10400.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10300.0,Bob,6,,
