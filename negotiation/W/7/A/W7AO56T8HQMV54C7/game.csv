"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring your product.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
