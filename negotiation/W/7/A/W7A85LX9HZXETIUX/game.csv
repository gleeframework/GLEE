"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $9000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $9000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8750. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think $9200 is the lowest price I can accept. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,5,
