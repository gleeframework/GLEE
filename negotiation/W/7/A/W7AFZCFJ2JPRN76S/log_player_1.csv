Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and given your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a backup buyer lined up."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **Backup Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides leverage. Alice can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Limited-Time Pressure:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000 and highlighting Bob's interest, Alice provides some justification for the higher price without revealing her absolute bottom line.

**The goal is to strike a balance:**  Offering a price too close to $10,000 leaves potential profit on the table. Offering a price too high might discourage Bob and lead him to reject the offer."
