Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.  I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for a loss.  I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm also reiterating my willingness to compromise and focusing on the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at a loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our last two offers, hoping to find a compromise. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87 for it. This is my last offer, so please let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to accept a loss. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids any further negotiation risks."
