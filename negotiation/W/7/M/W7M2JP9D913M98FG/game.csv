"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $7500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $8200? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and training to help you get the most out of the product.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $7800 for the product. I'm confident that the value it will bring to my business will be worth the investment, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you consider my offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8200 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle again at $7900? This price still reflects the value that I believe the product will bring to your business, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",7900.0,Alice,5,
