"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* $50 is a very good price, but there's room to negotiate further.
* It's too early to buy from John as I haven't explored Alice's potential price range. 
*  By rejecting, I can see if Alice is willing to go lower and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. 
* $40 is still a good deal for me, but it leaves room for Alice to counter if she's not willing to go that low. 
* I'm pushing for a price closer to my ideal range while still leaving space for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* $45 is a good deal for me, especially since it's a compromise from Alice's previous counteroffer.
* There's a chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and driving the price up is too high.
* I'm comfortable with this price and don't want to risk losing the product or wasting more rounds.
*  Buying from John for $120 is a far less desirable option."
