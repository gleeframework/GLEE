"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500, which is a significant saving. 
* **Even though you could buy from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $2,500.**"
