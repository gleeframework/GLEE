"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $16000. How about $14500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $14500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $17000. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is my last offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",16500.0,Alice,7,
