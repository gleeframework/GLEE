"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than $9,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on potential profit. It's in my best interest to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
