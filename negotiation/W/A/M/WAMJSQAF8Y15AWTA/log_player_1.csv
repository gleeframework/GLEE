{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that's above your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than your minimum, it's still below the value I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $95 is still a good profit and it seems like Bob won't go higher. It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk losing him and having to settle for $80 with John."
