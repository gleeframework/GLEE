Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While the product is interesting, that price is a little high for me. I would be willing to offer $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

We're still quite a bit away from a reasonable price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the movement, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's my best offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $1,350,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,350,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Buying from John at $1,200,000 guarantees the best possible outcome for you."
