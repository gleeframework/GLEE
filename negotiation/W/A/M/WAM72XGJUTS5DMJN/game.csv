"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm committed to getting this product but need to stay within my budget. I can offer $14,000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
