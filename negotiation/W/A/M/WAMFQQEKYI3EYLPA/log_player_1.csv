Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your desired price, but I'm still stuck at my maximum budget of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given our previous discussions and my clear commitment to acquiring this product.  Let's close the deal at this price.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing commitment to the negotiation, he seems unwilling to budge beyond $900,000. At this point, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is too significant to ignore. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
