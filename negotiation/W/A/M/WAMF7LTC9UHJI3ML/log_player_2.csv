"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It aligns perfectly with your needs and has the potential to generate substantial returns. I'm confident that this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, just as it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Consider this a chance to acquire a valuable asset that can drive your success.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000 
* **Your Maximum:** $1,000,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000
