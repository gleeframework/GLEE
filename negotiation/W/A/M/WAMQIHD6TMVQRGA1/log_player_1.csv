Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the wording allows for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to leave more room to come down.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important for future dealings, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term benefit."
