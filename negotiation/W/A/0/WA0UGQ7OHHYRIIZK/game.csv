"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $900000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm still getting a good deal and you're getting a quick sale. Let's see if we can agree.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $800000 is a fair price that benefits both of us. This is my final offer, and if you accept it, we can finalize the deal quickly. If you reject it, I will unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price around $825000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
