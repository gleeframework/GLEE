# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
