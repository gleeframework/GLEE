"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $950,000, we're ""anchoring"" the negotiation closer to his $1,000,000 valuation. This can subtly influence his counter-offers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $50,000 difference provides some leeway for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  It's clear there's room for negotiation, so it's best to counter-offer and try to move the price closer to a mutually beneficial point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product holds substantial value, as you know. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject the Lowball:**  Bob's offer was far too low. By firmly rejecting it, we signal that we're serious about the value of the product.
* **Concession with Justification:** We've made a significant concession by dropping $50,000 from our initial offer. However, we've coupled this with a reminder of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're still aiming high but moving closer to the middle ground. This keeps the negotiation alive while pushing Bob to make a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:** It's significantly above your $800,000 minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Profit:**  You're securing a $50,000 profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and meet you closer to the middle ground. 

While there might be a slight chance of squeezing out a bit more in further rounds, it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer. Accepting now secures a strong profit."
