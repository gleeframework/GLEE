Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Although his offer is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving. This price is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I'd get from John and is within a reasonable range for both of us."
