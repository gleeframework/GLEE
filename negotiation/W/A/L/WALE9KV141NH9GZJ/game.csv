"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1200000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1750000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
