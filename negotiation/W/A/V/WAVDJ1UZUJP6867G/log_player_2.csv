"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum budget, giving room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for me, while also being closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see we're getting closer.  However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1,050,000.  This price is fair, allows both of us to make a reasonable profit, and avoids us going back and forth further. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within Bob's budget and allows him to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While a bit more than his last counteroffer, accepting this offer is the most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point."
