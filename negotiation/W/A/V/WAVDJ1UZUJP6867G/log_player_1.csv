Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
