# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to see a price closer to $1,250,000. This still provides you a significant return on the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still too high.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit further. There's still a good chance to get a better price, and the risk of losing the deal is minimal compared to buying from John."
