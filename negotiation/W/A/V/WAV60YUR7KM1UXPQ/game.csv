"I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is well above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $12,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable with my previous offer of $8,000. This is the maximum I can spend at this time. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
