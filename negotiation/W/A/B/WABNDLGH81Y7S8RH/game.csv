"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it, which is closer to what you're asking. If you're open to this, I'd appreciate the opportunity to purchase it from you.",150.0,Bob,2,
