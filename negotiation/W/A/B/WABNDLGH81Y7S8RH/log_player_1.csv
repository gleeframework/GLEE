Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $150 for it, which is closer to what you're asking. If you're open to this, I'd appreciate the opportunity to purchase it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product's value and I have another buyer lined up. It makes more sense to sell to John for $150 than to potentially haggle with Bob and risk getting even less."
