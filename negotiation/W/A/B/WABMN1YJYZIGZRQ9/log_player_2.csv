"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob as it's within his budget and leaves room for potential compromise.  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet halfway at $13,000? That's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price and closer to Bob's desired price point, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown flexibility by moving from $14,000 to $13,000. By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains leverage and can potentially push for a lower price in the next round.  He has 7 rounds remaining, which provides ample time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a clear willingness to negotiate while still trying to keep the price as low as possible.  The offer of $12,500 is a small increase from his previous offer but demonstrates his commitment to reaching a deal. The message remains polite and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution."
