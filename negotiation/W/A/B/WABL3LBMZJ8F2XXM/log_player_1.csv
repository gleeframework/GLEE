Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also aware that John is willing to buy the product for $80, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm going to counter with $75. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. If he accepts, I'll still make a profit. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can get a little closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 74}
```

I'm going to counter with $74.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit.  If he rejects this, I'll likely accept his next offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $71
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already counter-offered several times.  It seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price, and I don't want to risk further lowering my price. Therefore, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $80."
