"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still do better. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives Bob leverage to potentially get a lower price from Alice or negotiate with John."
