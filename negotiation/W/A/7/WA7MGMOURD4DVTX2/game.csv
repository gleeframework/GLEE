"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
