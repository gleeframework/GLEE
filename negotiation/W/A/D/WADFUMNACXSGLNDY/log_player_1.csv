Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  That's still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,100 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although we're getting closer, I believe I can still get a better price.  It's not yet worth it to sell to John for $12,000."

Round 7
