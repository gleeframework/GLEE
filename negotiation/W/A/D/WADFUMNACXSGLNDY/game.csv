"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  That's still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to pay $9,100 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,100 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $9,175? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",9175.0,Alice,7,
