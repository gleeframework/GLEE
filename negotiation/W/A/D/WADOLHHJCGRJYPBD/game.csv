"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800,000. It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this number.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and the market.",825000.0,Alice,5,
