"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm looking to save as much as possible, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This price still gives you a significant saving compared to the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $12,000 to $10,500, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $10,250 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value to me and the price you're looking for.",10250.0,Bob,4,
