{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $12,000 and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to make a deal, his offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer to try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still above my minimum value, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum price, it's better than selling to John for the same amount. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and reach an agreement."
