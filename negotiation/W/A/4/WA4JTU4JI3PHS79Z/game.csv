"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $10,500?  This gives us both room to be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This price allows for a fair transaction for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
