"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $1,400,000 is still too high, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
