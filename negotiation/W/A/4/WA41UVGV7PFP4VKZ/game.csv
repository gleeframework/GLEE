"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both place on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product. Let's reach an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll lower the price to $1,290,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident that this is a fair price for a product of this value.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,290,000 is a good price, but I'm still trying to stretch my budget as far as possible.  I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both place on this product.  Let's seal the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more concession. I'll lower the price to $1,285,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1285000.0,Alice,7,
