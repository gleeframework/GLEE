"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
