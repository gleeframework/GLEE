"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $90 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $80? It's a fair price, and we can close the deal right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still want to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $92, which is a compromise that I think is fair. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,7,
