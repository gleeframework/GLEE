"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1500000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1750000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1750000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $1600000?  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and it leaves room for us to finalize the deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.
