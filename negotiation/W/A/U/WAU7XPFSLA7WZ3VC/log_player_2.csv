"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
