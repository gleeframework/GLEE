Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **It's a strong opening:**  A high opening price helps set the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down.
* **It's not unreasonable:** It's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a deal with John.
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I can strategically adjust my price based on his offer and my own assessment of the situation.

I believe this offer is a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also a substantial drop from my initial offer of $1,750,000.  

While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,450,000. Here's why:

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can continue adjusting my price depending on his counteroffers, while always considering John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that we're not going to reach a compromise that benefits both of us.

Considering John's offer of $1,500,000, it's the most financially sound decision to sell the product to him. I can secure a profit that meets my minimum requirement, ending the negotiation with Bob."
