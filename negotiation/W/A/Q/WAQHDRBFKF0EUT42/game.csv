,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
