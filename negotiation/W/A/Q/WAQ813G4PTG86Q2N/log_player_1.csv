I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can get a better price with a little more negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $115 is still a good deal, and it's likely Bob won't budge much further."
