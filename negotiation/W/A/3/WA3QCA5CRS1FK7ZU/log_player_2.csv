Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I believe the product's value justifies a premium price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my initial offer. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're close enough:**  Alice has come down to $990,000. This is only $10,000 more than John's price. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings and could risk Alice becoming less flexible.
* **Time constraint:** You're on round 7 of 10.  It's better to secure the deal now at a reasonable price than risk it falling apart closer to the deadline."
