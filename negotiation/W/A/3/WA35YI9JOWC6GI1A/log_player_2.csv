"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it allows me to earn a substantial amount. Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no need to spend the extra $200,000. You'll be better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your backup plan."
