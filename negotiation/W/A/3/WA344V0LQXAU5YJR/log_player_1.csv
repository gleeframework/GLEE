Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I am still well below my desired minimum of $120. I will try to get closer to that number in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can reach a price closer to $100 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
