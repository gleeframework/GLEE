Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're still looking to save money and $95 is too high. Keep negotiating with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While you could continue negotiating with Alice, you've already reached a point where her offers are getting closer to your maximum price.  Buying from John for $80 is a guaranteed deal that gets you the product for the lowest possible price."
