"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
