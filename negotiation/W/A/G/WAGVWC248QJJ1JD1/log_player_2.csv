"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  It's also a good idea to see if Alice is willing to go lower before considering buying from John at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 1275000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offer but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This is a good deal for Bob as he can get the product for a price below his maximum threshold of $1,500,000 and it is more than what Alice is willing to accept. It is unlikely that Alice will continue to lower her price significantly. Therefore, accepting this offer is the best option for Bob."
