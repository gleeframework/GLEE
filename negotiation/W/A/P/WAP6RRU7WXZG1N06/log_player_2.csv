"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. Would you like to take it home today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* While you could potentially get a better deal from John (if you reject Alice), accepting Alice's offer still allows you to save $3,000."
