"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup option.**  Buying from John is a viable alternative if you can't reach a better deal with Alice. 
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offering.** This gives you the chance to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than you'd like.** While it's a lower price than before, you're still paying more than you'd ideally want.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's still a gap between Alice's offer and your target price.
* **John is a backup.**  The option of buying from John is always there if you can't reach a better deal with Alice. 

By rejecting and making another counteroffer, you can potentially get the price down even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This product's value is substantial, and I want to ensure a fair deal. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This reflects the product's worth while recognizing your investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $1,000,000 is less than your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might be unproductive.** While you could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee you'll get it.  Alice has already come down significantly.
* **Time is a factor.** Continuing to negotiate could take time and potentially cost you the deal.

Accepting the offer saves you time and ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
