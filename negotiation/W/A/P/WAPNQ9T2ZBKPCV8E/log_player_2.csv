"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start at a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay, and there's still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to discuss this further, but I'd need to start closer to my budget. How about we try $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price point. There's room for further negotiation, and he has multiple rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'd like to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a free premium service that's worth $1,000. So, the total value would be $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the free premium service is a nice gesture, Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should reject and continue negotiating. There's still room for Alice to come down in price, especially since Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added bonus, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  How about we compromise at $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to maximize my profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, and while she's come down in price, she's still not willing to meet his desired price point.  He's already within a few rounds of reaching his limit, and it's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his target price, saving him both time and potential further negotiation headaches."
