"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to discuss this further, but I'd need to start closer to my budget. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'd like to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a free premium service that's worth $1,000. So, the total value would be $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added bonus, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  How about we compromise at $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to maximize my profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
