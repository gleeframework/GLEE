"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $790000?",790000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $790000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $820000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can do $815000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $812500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $813750. This is my final price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",813750.0,Alice,7,
