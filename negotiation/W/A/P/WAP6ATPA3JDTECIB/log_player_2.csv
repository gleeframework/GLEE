"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, so Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. It's a compromise that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still higher than the product's value to Alice.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to bring the price down further.  There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a fair price considering your cost and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make a serious effort to reach an agreement, Bob. I appreciate that. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above the product's value to her, but it's now within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action for Bob."
