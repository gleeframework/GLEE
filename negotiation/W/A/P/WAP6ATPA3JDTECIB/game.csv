"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get a better price.  How about $850,000? It's still a good deal for you and allows me to save some money.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. It's a compromise that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the product's value to me.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value this product, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a fair price considering your cost and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",880000.0,Bob,4,
