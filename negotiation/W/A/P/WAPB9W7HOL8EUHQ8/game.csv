"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe we can work together to make a mutually beneficial deal.",8500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $8,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $7,750. This is a significant discount from your initial price and a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to reach a final agreement.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $8,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,900. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can see the value in the product. Let's try to finalize the deal.",7900.0,Alice,5,
