Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is closer to the value Bob places on the product ($120) than my minimum price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message makes the negotiation less adversarial and more likely to result in a deal.
* **Asking for Feedback:**  Asking Bob what he thinks encourages him to engage in the negotiation and potentially reveal his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While $80 is my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price.  
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating he's willing to pay more than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $90, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $90 is still a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $85 is very close to my minimum price of $80.  
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $80.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, given Bob's willingness to only go up to $85."
