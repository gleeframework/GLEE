"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $2,000,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $1,350,000. How does that sound?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,350,000 remains below the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. This is a firm offer and represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I understand that the product has significant value, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,550,000. This is a strong offer, considering my budget and the value it offers me.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
