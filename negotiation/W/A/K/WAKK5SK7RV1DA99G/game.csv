"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to reflect your needs while still ensuring I receive a fair return. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a strong offer that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,450,000 to meet your needs, but this is my final offer. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
