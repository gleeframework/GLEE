"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500?  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",8500.0,Alice,5,
