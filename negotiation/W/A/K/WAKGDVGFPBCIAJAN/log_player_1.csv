{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value and the deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I want to maximize profit, I'm aware that a rigid stance might lead to a stalemate. By offering a price that's still within a reasonable range, I increase the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more flexible and potentially push for a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's clear he's interested in the product. This means there's room for further negotiation.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can afford to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer knowing that I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000 with John. This gives me the leverage to push for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer of $12,000 but still well above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while remaining profitable. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that even at $9,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price (which is still higher than Bob's perceived value). This avoids a situation where I end up selling for a significant loss. 
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing John's offer provides the confidence to remain firm and push for a price that's more advantageous to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows there's still potential to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I can afford to reject Bob's offer knowing that I have a guaranteed sale for $15,000 with John. This gives me leverage to push for a better price from Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500?  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (somewhat):** My counteroffer of $8,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and how $8,500 is a good deal.
* **Staying above the minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** Knowing John's offer provides the confidence to remain firm and potentially push for a higher price. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while minimizing the risk of accepting a too-low price."
