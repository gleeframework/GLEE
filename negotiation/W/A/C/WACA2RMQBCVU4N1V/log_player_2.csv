"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to come down to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While $7,500 is closer, I still need to get a bit more for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would be a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's aim for a win-win here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower than $8,500.  You've tested the waters and know you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It's better to secure the deal with John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
