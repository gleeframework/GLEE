"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share this product with you, it's truly unique and I know it can be incredibly valuable for someone like you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I think this is a fair starting point, reflecting the true worth of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* It's always worth negotiating, especially since Alice seems keen on selling and has indicated the product's value is high. 
* You have 10 rounds, so you have time to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is a significant dip below what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in finding the right fit, and I value our conversation.  So, I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still honoring the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* It's possible you can get closer to your target price by continuing to negotiate.
* You still have 7 rounds left, giving you time to see if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and the pressure from other potential buyers. I'm still interested in this product, but $1,120,000 is pushing my limit. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,080,000. This shows a genuine desire to close the deal and is a fair compromise. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up. I've tried to be upfront about the value here, and while other buyers are tempting, I believe in concluding negotiations fairly. I'm willing to land at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects my desire to see this deal through with you. However, I need you to understand that this is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still $100,000 above your maximum budget.
*  While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, it seems she's firm at $1,100,000. 
* You have 5 rounds left, but it's unlikely Alice will come down further.
*  You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000. 

It's not ideal to pay the full $1,000,000, but  it's a better outcome than pushing for more rounds with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing."
