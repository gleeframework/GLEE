Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go while still honoring the product's worth."",
