"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within a reasonable range given the product's value to Alice. I'm hoping this will prompt her to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1,025,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to see if I can push her further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high. I'm feeling more comfortable with $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my maximum budget, but I'm using more persuasive language to try and convince Alice. If she rejects this offer, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000 is too low, but $1,075,000 is too high. How about $1,062,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer, but they're still above my budget.  I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if I can get her down to my target price. Rather than risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal altogether, I'm going to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed deal at a price I'm comfortable with."
