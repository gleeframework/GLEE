"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflects the true potential of this product and the significant returns it can generate for you.  I'm willing to move slightly from my initial offer. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
