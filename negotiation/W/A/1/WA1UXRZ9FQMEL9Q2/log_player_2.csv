"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1500000. This product holds significant value and could be a game-changer for your [relevant industry/business]. I'm confident you'll recognize its potential. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product and Alice is offering it at that price, accepting her offer makes the most sense. There is no benefit to rejecting the offer and then buying from John at the same price."
