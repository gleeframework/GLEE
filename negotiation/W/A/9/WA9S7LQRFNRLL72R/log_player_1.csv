Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still giving me a significant savings compared to my alternative. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
