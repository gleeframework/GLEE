"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me a comfortable profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob would pay to John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit while still giving me a significant savings compared to my alternative.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This would still leave me with a good profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he'd pay John, and it's closer to his ideal price of $1,300,000. Continuing to negotiate might save a little more, but it risks losing the deal altogether or delaying the purchase. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
