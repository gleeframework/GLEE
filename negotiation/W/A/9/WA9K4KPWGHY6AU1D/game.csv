"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I am looking for a price closer to $1,200,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, allowing you to acquire the product for less than its value to you, and it would allow me to earn a more acceptable profit. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
