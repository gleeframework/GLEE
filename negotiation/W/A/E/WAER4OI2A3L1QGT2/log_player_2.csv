# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to give you a great deal. I'll sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the $8,000."
