"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $8,000. Can we try $9,000? It's the best I can do.",9000.0,Bob,4,
