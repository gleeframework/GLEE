"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
