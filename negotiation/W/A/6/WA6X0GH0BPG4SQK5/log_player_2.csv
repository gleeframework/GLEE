# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial, and I believe we can strike a deal that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
