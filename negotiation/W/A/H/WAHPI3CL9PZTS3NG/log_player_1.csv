Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's likely to consider it, knowing it's worth more to you.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  It gives you room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. 
* **Fair:**  It allows for a win-win scenario where you earn more than selling to John, and Bob gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and selling to John for $12,000 would be a much better outcome.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and guarantees me a profit."
