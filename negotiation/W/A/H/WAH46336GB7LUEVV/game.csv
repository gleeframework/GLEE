"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to market value to proceed.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a significant undervaluation, I'm willing to move closer to your range to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will deliver exceptional value, justifying this investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's the maximum I can justify for this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal.  While that offer is still well below my initial asking price, I understand you have a budget you're working with. Let's try $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your movement, the price is still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
