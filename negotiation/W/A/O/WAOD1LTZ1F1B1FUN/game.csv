"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my best offer at the moment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. This is my final offer for now.",16500.0,Alice,5,
