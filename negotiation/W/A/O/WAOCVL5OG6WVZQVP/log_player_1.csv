{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, aiming for a good profit.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:** This makes the offer attractive to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price up or down depending on Bob's response, while still maintaining a good profit margin.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $8,000 if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than $8,000 from John, it's still significantly lower than the $11,000 you initially offered.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, so there's room to try and get closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:**  This demonstrates that you believe the product is worth more.
* **Maintain leverage:** You can potentially drive the price up further. 
* **Explore a middle ground:**  A counteroffer allows you to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a fair price, considering you value the product at $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** This counter-offer is halfway between your previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Highlight value for Bob:** Emphasizing that the price is still significantly lower than Bob's valuation helps him see the value in accepting the offer.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, while still allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is only $250 away from your counteroffer of $10,250. It's a very small difference, and it's closer to your minimum price of $8,000 than John's offer.  Since Bob seems committed to staying within his budget, there's a good chance he won't budge further.  

**Here's why accepting is the best option:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $9,750 is significantly better than $8,000 from John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a deadlock or a lower price.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further rounds of back-and-forth, saving you time. 

This decision balances getting a decent price with the risk of losing a deal altogether."
