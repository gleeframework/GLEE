"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,250,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  It's also worth noting that selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option if this negotiation fails, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,350,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,300,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and gets me closer to my desired range.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
