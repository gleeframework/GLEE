"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.  Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could be flexible, but I'm looking for a price closer to $18,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  Would you consider $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
