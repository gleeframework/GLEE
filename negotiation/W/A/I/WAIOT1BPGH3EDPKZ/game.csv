"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value.  I'm asking $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll realize. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  It's a little lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This allows for a reasonable profit for me and a good value for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,325,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
