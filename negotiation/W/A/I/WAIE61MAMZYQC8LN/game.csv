"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price that I believe is fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This price would allow us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $980,000. This price is a fair compromise and would allow us to move forward with this deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this number.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,020,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  $1,020,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
