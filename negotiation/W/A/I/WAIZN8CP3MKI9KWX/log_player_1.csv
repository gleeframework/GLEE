Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly less than the $12,000 value for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe this product is worth more than $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit."
