"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm personally valuing at no less than $10000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you've indicated it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",11500.0,Alice,1,
