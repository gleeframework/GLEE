"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget.  While I can't go down to $100, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
