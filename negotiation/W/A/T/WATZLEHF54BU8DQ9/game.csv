"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free consultation to help you get the most out of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
