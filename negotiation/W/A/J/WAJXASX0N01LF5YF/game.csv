"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1250000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1350000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
