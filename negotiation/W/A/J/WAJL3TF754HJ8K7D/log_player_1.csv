Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He saves $50,000 compared to its value to him, and you earn $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, the message is framed to encourage discussion, leaving some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
