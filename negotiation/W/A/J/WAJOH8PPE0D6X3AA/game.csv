"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this offer represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, but your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $650,000. How about we try $1,100,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $850,000. Can we discuss this further?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer, but I believe this product would be most valuable to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure a fair return on this unique product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency about the other buyer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,6,
