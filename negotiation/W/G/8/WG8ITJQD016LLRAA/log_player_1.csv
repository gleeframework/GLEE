Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good price for me, considering I value it at $1,200,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my valuation but still leaves me with a profit. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob. This helps encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer:** Starting with a price closer to my valuation gives me more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as an alternative buyer provides leverage and allows me to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I believe I can secure a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Leverage with John:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the security to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $850,000 is a fair price, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves me with a good margin, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise but still keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while reaffirming the value of the product. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to consider a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's clear that further negotiation won't lead to a price that meets my needs.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit.
* **Risk of lower price:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him refusing my counteroffer or lowering his offer further. 
* **Time and energy:**  Further negotiation would take time and effort, and I'm better off securing a guaranteed sale with John."
