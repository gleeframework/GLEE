Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still exceeding my minimum value of $120.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product for $120, I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  It's likely Bob is willing to pay more, especially since he made a counteroffer.  Let's see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be a good middle ground for Bob.  I'm hoping he sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up to $125, which is a fair price considering he's been consistent with his offers. While I'd like to push for more, I'm comfortable selling at this price.  It's a decent profit and prevents me from going through more rounds of negotiation."
