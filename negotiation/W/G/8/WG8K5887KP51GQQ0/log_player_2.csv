"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price. I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500. If you're willing to come down a bit, I'd be happy to move forward. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7,500, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from the sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's target price of $7,500.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to sell and Bob could end up paying more. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets a good deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
