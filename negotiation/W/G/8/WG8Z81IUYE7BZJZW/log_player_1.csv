"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground, which should be appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to get a bit closer to $100 in the next round. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

I'm trying to be flexible by offering a price slightly closer to Bob's last offer. This could incentivize him to accept while still giving me a more profitable deal.  Let's see if this compromise works!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $97.50. How about we meet at $92? I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I think I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm also considering selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $92 is a fair price, I need to make a bit more to cover my costs. How about we meet at $95? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to offer $95, which is closer to Bob's last offer and a compromise that might be acceptable for both of us. There are fewer rounds left, so I need to make a decision soon. Let's see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $95. I was thinking more along the lines of $88. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too low with his offer.  I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's a good deal, and it guarantees me a profit."
