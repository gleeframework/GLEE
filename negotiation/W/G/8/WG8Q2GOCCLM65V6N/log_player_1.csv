"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to go a little higher.  How about $135?  That gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and we're already in round 4. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a slightly higher price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
