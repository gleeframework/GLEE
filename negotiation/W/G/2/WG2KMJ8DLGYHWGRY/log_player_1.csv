Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and potentially encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking Bob's opinion to show I'm open to negotiation.  

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale to John. I can always lower the price later if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. I can likely get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John offers a guaranteed $120, but I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

I'll counter with a price higher than $100 but lower than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you wanting to work with me.  I can go a bit lower, but $100 is just a bit too low for me right now. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $110?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering $110, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit.
* **Maintain Friendly Tone:**  Continuing the friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive and potentially leads to a faster agreement. 
* **Open for Discussion:** By asking ""Let me know what you think,"" I'm leaving the door open for further discussion if Bob still wants to go lower.  

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob rejecting this offer and potentially moving on."
