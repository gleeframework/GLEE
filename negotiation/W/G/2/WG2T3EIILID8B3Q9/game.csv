"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a great starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still aiming for $850,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is the best price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I'm prepared to pay $890,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.  What do you think?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $890,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $915,000 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable, but I'm willing to compromise once more.  How about we settle on $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  Let's not let this opportunity pass us by.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your eagerness to close the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $910,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,9,
