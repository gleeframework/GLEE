Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $75 is a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5.

We're getting close! Alice is coming down, and we still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, it is a great product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 
This strategy aims to:

* **Be direct:**  Phrases like ""my final offer"" add weight and signal you're serious.
* **Offer a win-win:**  $80 is Alice's value, so she's likely to accept, and you get a good deal. 
* **Maintain politeness:**  Even in negotiations, keeping things pleasant helps!

If Alice rejects this, we'll need to reassess in the next round."
