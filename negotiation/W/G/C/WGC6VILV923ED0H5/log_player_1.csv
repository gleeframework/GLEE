Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $170. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is lower than yours, it's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Anchoring:** Offering $170 first sets a higher anchor price in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects it, he might be more open to a slightly lower counter-offer that's still above your minimum.
* **Backup Buyer:** You have the security of John who will buy the product for $150. This means you don't have to desperately accept any offer below that. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate down slightly. You can gradually lower the price (e.g., to $160, then $155) to see if you can reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John."
