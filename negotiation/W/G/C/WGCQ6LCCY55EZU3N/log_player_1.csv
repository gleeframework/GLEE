""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll appreciate its value. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its unique nature, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget and the value I place on it, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches John's guaranteed offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a higher price. It's possible Bob is firm on his valuation. 

Since the product is worth no less than $1,000,000 to me (Alice), accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome with the least risk at this point."
