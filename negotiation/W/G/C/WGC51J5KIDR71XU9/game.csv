"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal, while ensuring I receive a fair price for this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $975,000 is still not quite there. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,012,500. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
