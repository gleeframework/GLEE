Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, giving him room to counter without feeling pressured.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  A friendly tone invites Bob to engage in a conversation rather than feeling like he's being given a take-it-or-leave-it offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly less than your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired amount.
* **Assess Bob's willingness:** This helps understand how much he values the product.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while maintaining a chance to secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
