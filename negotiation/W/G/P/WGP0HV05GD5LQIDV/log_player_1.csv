"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000 for the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too far below my minimum price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. How about $825,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $825,000 isn't my ideal price, it's a decent compromise, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and I'm not willing to take that chance."
