"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can likely get a better deal than $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $1,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still above your desired price point, and you have time to negotiate.  Alice has shown a willingness to move, so it's worth trying for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, as this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that is very close to your ideal.  While it is a bit higher than you initially hoped for,  it's still a good deal, and you have a limited number of rounds left.  There's a chance she won't budge any further, and you'll have to buy from John at a much higher price."
