"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $1,500.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, as this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $250.",12750.0,Alice,5,
