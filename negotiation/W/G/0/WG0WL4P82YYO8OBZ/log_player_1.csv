Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $95 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $100, so he might be willing to pay a bit less but still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a price that benefits both of you. 

Let me know how Bob responds, and we'll adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below my minimum price of $80. While it's tempting to accept due to the possibility of a counteroffer, I'm choosing to reject his offer for the following reasons:

* **Maintaining my minimum:**  Selling for $70 would result in a loss for me, which I'm not willing to accept.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, I can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob or explore selling to John for $80, which is still a better deal than $70.

Let's see if we can convince Bob to pay closer to my minimum or if John is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $85 is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" Bob would be getting, making it more appealing.
* **Maintain profitability:** This price still allows me to make a profit while staying close to my minimum. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $85 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $77 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  At this point, I'm choosing to sell to John for $80. Here's why:

* **Time is valuable:** The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and I don't want to risk further delays with Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer of $80 guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential for further price drops with Bob.
* **Avoiding potential deadlock:**  There's a chance that Bob and I might continue to haggle, and we could end up in a stalemate where neither of us is willing to budge.

Selling to John ensures a quick and certain transaction, which is more valuable than risking a lower price with Bob."
