"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to both of us. I'm starting with an offer of $1750000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product. I'm open to discussing a fair price, so let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1400000.  This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm happy to compromise and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to come in under $1500000.  Let's try $1450000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1450000 is closer to my bottom line, it still falls short of what this product is truly worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1550000. This is a final offer, and it allows us both to secure a profitable deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1550000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1525000, which is a fair compromise.  This deal is important to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close.  $1525000 is almost there, but I'm still a bit short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1537500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen.",1537500.0,Alice,7,
