"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $20,000, $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to budge much.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $10,000, which is $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $13,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to counteroffer again with a price closer to my budget and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference again. How about $11,500? This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $11,500 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not confident we'll reach a price that works for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
