"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more. I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate and I know I can sell to John for that price, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my ideal value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but if he doesn't, I have more rounds to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm still going to reject it. I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any real pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing him that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial valuation. I'm hoping that with fewer rounds left, Bob will be more inclined to accept a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is significantly below my minimum.  While I have 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can convince Bob to go higher. With John offering $15,000, it's a safer and more profitable choice to sell to him."
