"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Even if Alice is firm on $150, rejecting her offer allows you to open up the negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $150 to $135. This is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. It's still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150."
