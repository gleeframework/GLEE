"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  My starting price is $1200000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring negotiations to see if you can reach a more favorable price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest but also your firm budget.  It's a strong starting point for negotiations.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product while also highlighting your budget constraint. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for both parties to compromise and find a price that works.  

This strategy aims to put pressure on Alice to consider a lower price while remaining open to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1050000. This is a significant compromise, but I value a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. There's room for further negotiation to potentially get a better price. By rejecting this offer, you can send a counteroffer closer to your desired price and see if Alice is willing to compromise further.  

**Important Consideration:**

* **Time is a Factor:** With only 10 rounds, you need to be strategic about when to accept or reject offers.  You're nearing your budget limit, but there's still potential for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** Keep John's offer in mind. If negotiations with Alice stall, you have a fallback option at $1,000,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is your maximum budget and signals to Alice that you're serious about closing the deal. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** The message frames your offer as fair considering the product's value.
* **Pressure to Accept:**  This sets a clear deadline for Alice to accept your offer. If she rejects, you can then explore buying from John.

**Considering John's Offer:**

* This is a strategic move. If Alice rejects this offer, you can confidently proceed with John's offer without losing any more negotiation rounds."
