"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save money. While Alice's offer is your maximum budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  By rejecting, you can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push for a lower price. There's no harm in rejecting this offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount. I'm happy to offer $10,500. This feels like a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a discount, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to consider another compromise. How about we meet in the middle again at $10750? This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer. You've already saved $1250 and are now within $250 of your ideal price.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up with the higher price from John is high. It's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer is the safest and most practical choice."
