"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to reach a price I'm comfortable with. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I really appreciate it. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to go above $8,500 for this product. Is there any chance you could meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $9,250? That's closer to your offer, and it's a price that I can live with. It's a great opportunity for you to get a quality product at a fair price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to stay close to my original budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,750 for the product? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
