Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant discount for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 975000}

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $925,000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

I've reached a point where I'm not sure Bob is serious about getting this deal done. He keeps pushing for a price that's too low for me. To avoid wasting any more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
