"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still offers you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go lower than this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
