Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's within Bob's range:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so he has room to pay more. 
* **It's assertive:** The message sets a clear expectation and encourages Bob to make a decision. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate. Be prepared to make counteroffers if necessary, but always keep your minimum value in mind. If Bob becomes unreasonable or the negotiation drags on, you can always turn to John, who is willing to pay your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,200,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still offers you a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's a significant drop:**  From $1,200,000 to $1,050,000 shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's above your minimum:** It still guarantees you at least $50,000 above your minimum.
* **It's firm:**  The message conveys a willingness to discuss but also sets a clear lower limit.

This approach shows you're serious about a deal but aren't desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,200,000. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  The negotiation seems to be getting stuck, and I'm confident that I can get my minimum value from John. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
