Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $1,150,000.  This offer stands only for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $150,000 discount from the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).
    * You make a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if there aren't any explicitly) might encourage Bob to act quickly."
