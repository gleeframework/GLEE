Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great starting point, but I'm not sure I can justify $12000 at this point. I'm very interested in the product, but I'd need to see it at a lower price to make it work for me.  How about $9000?  This reflects my budget and the value I'm placing on the item right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
