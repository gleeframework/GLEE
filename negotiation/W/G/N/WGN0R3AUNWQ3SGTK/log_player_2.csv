"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to pay up to $800,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for the value it brings you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, you're still aiming for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. You have several rounds left, so you can still bargain for a price closer to your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement, and it's within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $875,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000. This price acknowledges your financial constraints while still allowing me to get closer to the value I'm seeking.  Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $900,000 is still too high.  You're determined to save as much money as possible and have several rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter and potentially close the deal at a price even closer to your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $890,000 for the product. This is a very fair price, and it's the best I can offer. Let's close this deal now, it's in both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we are getting closer.  However, $890,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'll accept $900,000. This shows that I'm committed to closing this deal, but it also allows me to receive a fair price for the product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $900,000, which is still $100,000 above your ideal price of $800,000. While you've made some progress in negotiations, it seems Alice might be unwilling to drop her price further. 

You only have three rounds left, and the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high. It's more prudent to buy the product from John at $800,000. This guarantees you the product at your target price, securing a significant saving and minimizing the risk of further negotiations."
