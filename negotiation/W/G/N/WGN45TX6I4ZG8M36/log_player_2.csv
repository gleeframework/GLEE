"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal! I think you'll find it incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

I'm hoping Alice might come down on her price. It's a better strategy to see if I can get it closer to $100 before accepting."
