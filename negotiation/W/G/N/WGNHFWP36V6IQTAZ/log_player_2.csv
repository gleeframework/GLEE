"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I believe a price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's far more than the product is worth to me. I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above John's offer, leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also have a clear limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'll reject and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to meet halfway. However, it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" and mutual benefit to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. $12,000 is my absolute bottom line - I'm essentially taking a loss at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget, even though she claims it's her bottom line. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems we are at an impasse. Given that I have limited rounds and John is offering the product at my maximum budget, I'll choose to buy from John to secure the product without further delay."
