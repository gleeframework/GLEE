Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the value to Bob might make the offer more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
