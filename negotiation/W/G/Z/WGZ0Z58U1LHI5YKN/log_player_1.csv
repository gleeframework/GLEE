"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while also leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value, a high initial offer might make him think the product is worth more, encouraging him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to raise his bid.  I still have 9 rounds to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for the bare minimum unless I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a substantial profit.  By offering a price that's closer to Bob's initial offer, I hope to encourage further negotiations and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and we're getting closer to a deal.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer at $1,100,000 is a good outcome. It's above my minimum and a decent profit.  It's also worth noting that we are only in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by pushing for more and potentially having Bob walk away."
