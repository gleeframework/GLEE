"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being within my price range. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I understand your perspective.  I could be willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price,  given my budget and the value of the product to me.  This would be a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase and I respect that.  Let's make this happen.  My final offer is $950,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
