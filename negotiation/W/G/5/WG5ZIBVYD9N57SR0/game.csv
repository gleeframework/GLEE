"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
