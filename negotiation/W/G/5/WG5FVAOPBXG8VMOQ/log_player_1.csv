Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 

As Alice, I know I have a guaranteed sale at $100.  Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows the possibility to earn more.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
