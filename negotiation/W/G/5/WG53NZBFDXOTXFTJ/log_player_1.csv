"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, as it's above your value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll accept Bob's offer.  It's close enough to my desired price, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely.  $8,750 is a good deal for me, and it seems like a fair compromise."
