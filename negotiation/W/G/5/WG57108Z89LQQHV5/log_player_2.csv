"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $90, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of Alice engaging further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me halfway, $105 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. There's potential to negotiate a price closer to $100.
* **John's Price as Leverage:** Knowing I can buy the product from John for $120 gives me leverage. I'm willing to walk away if Alice doesn't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):**  This offer shows a willingness to negotiate by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($105) and my previous offer ($90).
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a specific price and framing it as ""fair for both of us,"" I'm subtly pushing for a decision without being overly aggressive. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm still below John's price, maintaining a safety net if Alice refuses to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly set on staying above $100. Each additional round of negotiation yields smaller and smaller gains.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $102.50 is only $2.50 more than my ideal price and significantly less than John's offer. It's a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures a good price and allows me to move on."
