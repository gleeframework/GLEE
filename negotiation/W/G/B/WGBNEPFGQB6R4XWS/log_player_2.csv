"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your estimated value of the product ($1,500,000).  While $800,000 is a good deal, there's likely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  The counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant jump from Alice's initial offer, but still below your maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but are also looking for a better price. It opens the door for further negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Value Focus:**  The message highlights the value you place on the product, which helps justify your proposed price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product at $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:**  Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, dropping the price to $1,100,000.
* **Good Deal:**  While you could potentially negotiate further, this price is still within your acceptable range and significantly lower than your initial valuation of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might save you a little more, but it risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
