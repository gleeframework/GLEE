"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
