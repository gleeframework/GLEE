"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
