"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice's offer is significantly more than that. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. You're determined to stay within your budget of $800,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John, who is offering the product at your desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get you a better deal."
