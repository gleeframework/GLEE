"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
