Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to go slightly above that. Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept if he's motivated.
* **Near Your Minimum:** This price is still very close to your minimum acceptable price ($150).  If Bob rejects, you don't lose much by selling to John.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the offer as a ""good deal,"" potentially swaying Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. 
* A more aggressive approach would be to offer a price closer to $150, but that carries a higher risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
