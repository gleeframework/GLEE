Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I want to give you a chance to own it before I list it publicly. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** I know John will buy the product for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a high offer ($20,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies he might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Not appearing desperate:**  While I mention a ""discounted price,"" I don't reveal how low I'm actually willing to go.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
