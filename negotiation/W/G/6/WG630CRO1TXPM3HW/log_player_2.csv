"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$400,000 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no harm in rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm aiming to find a price point where we can both agree, but still save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $350,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a significantly lower price than John's offer and allows me to save money."
