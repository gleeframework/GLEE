"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
