Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100. 

By offering the product at $115, you are:

1. **Maximizing Profit:** You are aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, which is just below his maximum valuation.
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting a bit higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants. 
3. **Securing a Better Price than John:** Even if Bob rejects your offer, you are guaranteed $100 from John.

This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
