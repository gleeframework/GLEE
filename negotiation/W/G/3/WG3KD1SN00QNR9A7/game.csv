"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $14000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $15500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15000, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let's close this deal!",15000.0,Bob,4,
