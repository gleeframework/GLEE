"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $14000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I need to make a profit, $14,000 is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $15,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15000, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly what John is offering. This is a good outcome for me since I'm at my minimum price point."
