# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $1,000,000 to you, at a price that is just slightly above its intrinsic value. I believe this offer presents a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's value to her ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, I can try to get a lower price through counteroffers."

Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must maintain a fair market value for my products. I am unable to accept your offer at $850,000. However, I am willing to consider a counteroffer of $900,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit while remaining competitive within the market. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my target price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. There's still room to lower the price, and I'm confident I can get it below $900,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider a final offer of $887,500 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $887,500 is very close to my target price and well below John's price of $1,000,000. There's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a significantly lower price. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like a fair compromise for Alice. I'm going to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
