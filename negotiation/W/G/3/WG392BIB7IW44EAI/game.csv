"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $1,000,000 to you, at a price that is just slightly above its intrinsic value. I believe this offer presents a fair deal for both parties.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, allowing you a significant profit and me a valuable asset at a price below my estimated worth. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I must maintain a fair market value for my products. I am unable to accept your offer at $850,000. However, I am willing to consider a counteroffer of $900,000. This price still allows for a substantial profit while remaining competitive within the market. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This offer allows you a good profit margin while still giving me a fair price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise and a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider a final offer of $887,500 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable profit for me while still being a fair price for you based on the product's value. I hope this offer meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",887500.0,Alice,5,
