"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! However, $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $82.50. Can you consider my revised offer?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $87.50. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to sell it to you at that price. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $84.50, but no higher. Can you consider my revised offer?",84.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $86, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",86.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice! However, $86 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $84, but that's my final offer. Can you consider my revised offer?",84.0,Bob,8,
