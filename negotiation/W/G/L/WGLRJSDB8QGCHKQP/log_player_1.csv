Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've set the initial price at $1,100,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I've included a message that acknowledges Bob's potential value and attempts to justify the price, making it seem like a fair offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, implying a willingness to discuss further. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to start the negotiation strong, leaving room for me to adjust the price if Bob counters.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than his initial perceived value, it's not enough for me to sell at this point. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can achieve a better price through continued negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've counter-offered with a price of $1,150,000, which is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The message emphasizes that this is a compromise, implying that further concessions might be difficult. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message reiterates the product's value and the desire for a fair deal, framing it as a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing flexibility while still maintaining a position that's closer to my desired price.  The message also emphasizes that this is a ""meeting in the middle"" to encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a proposal of $1125000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing out to John outweighs the potential gain from a slightly higher price. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
