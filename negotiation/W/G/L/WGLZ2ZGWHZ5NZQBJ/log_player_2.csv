"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You might get a better price, and you have nothing to lose by rejecting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also establishes a clear starting point for negotiation.  My goal is to get as close to my $10,000 budget as possible, but I'm willing to pay a bit more if it means securing a good deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my budget.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better price.  If I keep rejecting, she might come down even further to avoid losing the sale completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still staying below my $10,000 limit. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also firm on my budget. I hope this will encourage Alice to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still outside my preferred budget range.  I'm confident we can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation process.  The more rounds we go through, the more pressure will be on Alice to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it below $11,000 to make it a good deal for both of us. We've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation, and Alice seems willing to keep lowering the price. I'm confident that this counteroffer will push her to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is continuing to lower her price, it's still above my ideal budget. I want to keep pushing for a better deal.  We're getting close to my limit, but I'm not ready to give up yet.  A few more rounds of negotiation could get us to a point where I'm comfortable accepting her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but we're getting closer.  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm still interested in the product and willing to negotiate further.  This time, I'm also pushing closer to my budget limit, but I'm hoping that Alice will see that I'm serious about closing the deal.  It's now or never for a good deal with Alice. If she rejects, I'll be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still above my budget. We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure if I can convince Alice to go any lower. It's better to be safe than sorry, and at this point, buying from John is the most reasonable option. It ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids any further negotiation uncertainty."
