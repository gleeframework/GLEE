"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500, which is closer to my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm willing to give you a small concession, though. I'll throw in a bonus service worth $200 that will make the product even more valuable to you. If you're still interested, I'll sell it to you for $9,800. This is my final offer.",9800.0,Alice,5,
