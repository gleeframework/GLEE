"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it would be a highly beneficial asset to you.  To start the negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this reflects its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the price you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'll offer $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You clearly recognize the value of this product.  Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, so I'll offer $862,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",862500.0,Bob,6,
