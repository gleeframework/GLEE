Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to get.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'm offering $1375000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

While $1,375,000 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,375,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $1562500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1406250, which is 10% lower than your last offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,406,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,406,250 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while we're getting closer, we're not quite there yet.  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob will only waste more time, and we might not reach a satisfactory price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
