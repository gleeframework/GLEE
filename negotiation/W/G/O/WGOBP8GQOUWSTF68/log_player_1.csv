Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing John guarantees a $1,000,000 sale, Alice starts high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Just below Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is slightly less than what Bob values the product at ($800,000), potentially enticing him to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and long-term benefits might persuade Bob, even at a price point above his initial valuation.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation, and Bob might counter-offer. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate further or walk away knowing she has John's guaranteed purchase."
