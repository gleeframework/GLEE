Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum value of $120.
* **It's below John's offer:** You're leaving room for negotiation without risking losing a sale to John.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  Bob values the product at $100, so $115 leaves some room for him to feel he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum price of $120. While it's tempting to take a quick sale,  you can likely get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for a product worth more than that to me."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $110 is a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below it. You're not desperate for a sale, and John is willing to pay your minimum price. You can likely get a better price by making one more counteroffer."
