It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  While $850,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point. Hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

Alice's offer of $795,000 is a good compromise, and it's better than my initial counteroffer. It's also still significantly less than the price from John.  It's time to accept the deal and secure the product."
