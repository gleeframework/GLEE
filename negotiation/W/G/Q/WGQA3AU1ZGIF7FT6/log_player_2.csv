"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000.  You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

You are very close to your target price, but Alice is unwilling to go lower. It's better to buy from John for $10,000 than to risk further negotiation."
