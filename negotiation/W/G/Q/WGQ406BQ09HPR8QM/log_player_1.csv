Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

While Bob is getting closer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. Holding firm at this stage maintains pressure and signals the seriousness of the $1,000,000 price point. We're getting into the later rounds, but we still have John as a reliable backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and transparent about my position. To move this forward, I'm willing to offer the product for $995,000. This is a final concession, as I believe it truly splits the difference while recognizing the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Putting a slight time pressure on Bob encourages a decision.
* **""Final"" Offer:**  This language signals to Bob that further haggling is unlikely to result in large movements.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic is often seen as fair, even if it's slightly skewed in our favor. It can be psychologically effective in pushing for a close."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your last offer. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $990,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate at this point is unlikely to yield significant gains. Bob is very close to our target price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** We risk losing Bob altogether if we push further, leaving us with only John's guaranteed offer. Accepting the $990,000 secures a very good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now puts the cash in hand quicker, allowing for reinvestment or other opportunities."
