"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. It also gives Bob some room to negotiate if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still less than I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140 to Bob. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's a good middle ground that still allows me to earn a decent profit while showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good offer! $135 is a decent price, and I'm getting closer to my ideal value.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with John's $120 offer. It's better to accept the offer and ensure a sale at a reasonable price."
