"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is better than her product's value to her ($15,000), you know you can get a better deal from John ($12,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the door open to securing the best possible price."
