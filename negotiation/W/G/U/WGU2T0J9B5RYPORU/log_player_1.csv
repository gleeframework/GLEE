Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can be more firm in your pricing.
* **Respectful Communication:**  The message is polite and frames the offer as an exclusive opportunity for Bob. This approach can make Bob feel valued and more open to considering the offer."
