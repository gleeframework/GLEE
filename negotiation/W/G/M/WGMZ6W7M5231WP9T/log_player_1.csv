"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While I need to be careful not to lose him completely, $10,500 is too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can meet you at $11,000, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $10,750 is still a decent deal, and it's getting close to the price John is willing to pay.  It's not worth risking losing Bob altogether at this point."
