"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal than $18000.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $17000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'd like to propose $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at a price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $15500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I propose a price of $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
