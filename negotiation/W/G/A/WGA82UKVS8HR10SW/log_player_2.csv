Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $115. Accepting at this point secures the product for significantly less than John's offer."
