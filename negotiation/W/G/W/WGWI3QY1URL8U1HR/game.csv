"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is definitely interesting to me, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. If you're still interested, let me know.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
