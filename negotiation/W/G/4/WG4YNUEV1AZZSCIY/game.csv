"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering we're both looking to make a deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $975,000. This is a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $950,000 is too low, so I'll offer $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
