"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which would be $10,500. Can we meet at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,500.  It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high for me to accept.  How about we split the difference again and go with $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you've said you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $10,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Bob,6,
