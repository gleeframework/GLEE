Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $78 is still too low.  I'm confident this product is worth more to you, and I'm willing to come down to $82. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

While $79 is close to my minimum price,  it's still below my minimum price.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale to John. I'll sell to John for $80."
