"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $100? I'm really hoping we can make a deal.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130. However, that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which would be $122.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",122.5,Alice,5,
