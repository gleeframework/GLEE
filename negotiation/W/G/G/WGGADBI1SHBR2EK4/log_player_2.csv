I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit. My final offer is $1,050,000, and I'll include some additional services that will make the product even more valuable to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and while the extras might be nice, going above your budget isn't worth it. You can get the product for your maximum price from John."
