"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit. My final offer is $1,050,000, and I'll include some additional services that will make the product even more valuable to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
