"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a fair starting point, as it's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($120).  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'm counteroffering with a price of $110. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I believe this price is fair and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm running out of rounds. I'd rather sell to Bob for $104 than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
