Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly approach might make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Option for John:**  I keep John's offer in mind, knowing I can secure $15,000 elsewhere. 

**Strategy:**

This approach balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I'll have a better idea of where he's willing to go, and I can adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's close to his estimated value, it's significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable price.  However, I'll need to be mindful of John's offer and be prepared to walk away if it doesn't look like I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a little too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product while acknowledging his budget constraints.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum, giving me room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and maintaining a positive negotiating relationship with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have a clearer picture of his price range and can decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's come up from $9,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a much better deal.**  Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This time, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and move forward with selling to John. The negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price that's even close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,500 is still too far below what I need for this product. I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I wish you the best in finding what you need."", ""product_price"": 0} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Rejection:** I'm directly communicating to Bob that his offer is unacceptable. 
* **No Counteroffer:**  Since I'm choosing to sell to John, I'm not providing a counteroffer. 
* **Professional Closure:**  I'm ending the negotiation respectfully, acknowledging his effort and wishing him luck.

**Strategy:**

This message definitively closes the negotiations with Bob while maintaining a professional tone. I'm choosing to end the negotiations and secure the guaranteed profit from John, making this the best outcome for me in this scenario."
