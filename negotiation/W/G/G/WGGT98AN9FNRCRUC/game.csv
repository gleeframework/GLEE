"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a little too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $9,500 is still too far below what I need for this product. I'm going to have to pass on your offer. I wish you the best in finding what you need.",0.0,Alice,5,
