Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we set the product price at $1,100,000? I think this would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob.  While I'm happy with $1,100,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This is still below your initial asking price and aims to find a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging from $1,100,000, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,110,000. This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can finalize this. "", ""product_price"": 1110000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a final price of $1,090,000. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to the end of the negotiation, and while I'm happy with $1,090,000, it's still not my ideal price.  I've already rejected a few offers, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and it's the best option for me at this point."
