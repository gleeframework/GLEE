It's better to try to get a better deal from Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:

While $950,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice is clearly willing to come down in price, so there's potential to get an even better deal."
