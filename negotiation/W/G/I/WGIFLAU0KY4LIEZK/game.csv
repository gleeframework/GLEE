"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its worth to me is no more than $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is no more than $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,250. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
