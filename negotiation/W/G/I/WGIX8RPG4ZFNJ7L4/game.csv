"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept. This product has incredible value, and I'm confident you'd find it worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. While $16,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large.  To be frank, I have another offer for $15,000. If you're able to meet that price, the product is yours. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other option.",15000.0,Alice,5,
