Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,200,000 (John's offer).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for the higher end of the ZOPA is ideal. However, you need to balance this with the risk of Bob rejecting your offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its worth in the market.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher than $1,400,000 to allow room for concessions.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have a backup offer, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial for future business opportunities."
