"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above the value Bob places on the product, but still significantly less than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **Establishing Value:** I mention the product's value to me and emphasize the opportunity for a fair price. This hints at my willingness to negotiate but also sets a strong initial position. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  $900,000 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Compromise:** I'm decreasing my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not dropping too much, showing I still value the product.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Optimism:**  The message remains positive and focused on reaching a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and ending up with John's offer is high.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit, whereas rejecting it risks a stalemate or a lower price. 

It's a tough call, but given the context, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most strategic decision."
