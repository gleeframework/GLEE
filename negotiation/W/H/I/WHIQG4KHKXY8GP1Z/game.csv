"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my desired value. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $925,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $900,000? That would be a more comfortable price point for me, and I think we could still make a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
