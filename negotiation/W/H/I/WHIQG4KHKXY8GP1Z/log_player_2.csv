Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to my desired value. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.

You should reject Alice's offer. While $925,000 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your maximum budget, and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
