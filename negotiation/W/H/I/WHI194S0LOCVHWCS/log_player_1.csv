"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for room to compromise. It's important to be confident in my offer and leave room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is still a great price for a product that's worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to go up to $16000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $16,000. This is a good outcome for me, considering the minimum I was willing to accept was $15,000."
