"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially if she wants to make the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget of $1,000,000. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a better price. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and it's not worth risking missing out on the guaranteed deal with John."
