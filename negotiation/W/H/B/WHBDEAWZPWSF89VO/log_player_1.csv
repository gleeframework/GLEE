"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500 as it is worth more than $10,000 to me. I will counteroffer to Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. $8,750 is far too low for a product worth $10,000 to me. I will counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. $8,750 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to drop the price to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and your budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
