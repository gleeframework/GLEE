"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth significantly more. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I can't go as low as $8500, I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Although Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price.  He has the option to buy from John for $8,000, so he's not under pressure to accept right away.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards Bob's goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. $8750 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to drop the price to $9250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and your budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $9,250 is still too high.  Since Bob has only 5 rounds remaining and can get the product from John for $8,000, he's better off taking the guaranteed deal with John. It's unlikely Alice will drop her price enough in the remaining rounds to justify continued negotiation."
