I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving a significant profit for myself. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still a good price, but I believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant profit and a good deal.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale to John."
