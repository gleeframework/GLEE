Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging from his $12,500 price, but I'm still hoping to get a little bit more.  I'll see if I can get him to come up just a little bit more in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $12700. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12600. That's my final offer, so let's see if we can wrap this up.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,600 is a good price and it's getting late in the game. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
