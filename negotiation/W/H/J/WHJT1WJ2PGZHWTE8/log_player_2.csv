"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since Bob's maximum is $10,000,  there's room to try and get a better deal. There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's potential for a counteroffer to be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:** A $2,500 reduction from Alice's initial price is a significant starting point for negotiation. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal.
* **Open Communication:**  Bob's message is friendly and open to negotiation. This helps build rapport with Alice and makes her more likely to consider the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest.  $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing flexibility by coming down in price, but $8,500 is still too high for Bob, who has a maximum of $10,000 and is aiming for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is proposing a compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. This shows he's actively trying to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes ""fair price"" and ""benefits both of us,""  creating a win-win situation in Bob's mind.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob reiterates that he believes the product is valuable, but he's still looking for a good deal."
