"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects its true value. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you encourage dialogue and signal a willingness to negotiate.

This is a starting point. It's crucial to listen to Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. I suggest we aim for $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to his own valuation than yours. While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, my valuation of the product remains significantly higher than your current offer.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:**  Moving down $200,000 from the initial offer shows flexibility but also emphasizes that you're serious about a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Using language like ""middle ground"" and ""fair compromise"" encourages a collaborative spirit in the negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Continuing to subtly emphasize the product's worth keeps it in the forefront of Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $1,600,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest. Accepting now capitalizes on his momentum.
* **Time Value:**  While further negotiation is possible, the difference in potential gain might not outweigh the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through."
