``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to entice him to accept. I'm ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has value, but I believe I can find a fair price within my budget. How about we consider $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's below my minimum price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $10,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure the product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm counter-offering at $10,250. It's still a good profit for me, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought, and I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $10,000 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal. It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I won't have to go through the hassle of another sale."
