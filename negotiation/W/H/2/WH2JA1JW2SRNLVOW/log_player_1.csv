Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm mentioning the ""value"" of the product to give Bob a reason to consider my offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my desired range.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response will tell me if he's truly interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  Having a higher starting point allows me to negotiate down without feeling like I'm losing too much.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since Bob expressed initial interest in the product. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Settlement:**  Accepting Bob's offer right away might leave money on the table.

I'm going to counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This gives me a chance to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer!  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000.  This still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, But Not Giving Up:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not settling for Bob's initial counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the reason behind my asking price. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation productive.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:**  A price between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer increases the chances of a deal.
* **Test Bob's Willingness:**  His response will reveal whether he's seriously interested and willing to meet me halfway.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to make further adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $14000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  There's a chance that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process.
* **Time is Money:** Selling to Bob now secures a reasonable profit without risking further negotiation delays.

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting this offer is the most prudent choice considering the risk of further negotiations."
