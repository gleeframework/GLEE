Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I was hoping we could meet at $12,000, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000 to my minimum price of $15,000, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,500.  It's better to secure the product at John's $12,000 price than risk losing the deal entirely."
