"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you are aiming to save as much money as possible and can get the product for $800,000 from John.  By rejecting, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend no more than $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I believe it's a fair offer given the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm unable to go as low as $800,000.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Would you consider $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while still acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to your goal, it's still above your desired price point. Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, it's more advantageous to buy from him and save an additional $50,000."
