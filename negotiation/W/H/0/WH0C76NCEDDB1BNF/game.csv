"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this will prove to be a wise investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product truly is exceptional and will yield significant returns. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
