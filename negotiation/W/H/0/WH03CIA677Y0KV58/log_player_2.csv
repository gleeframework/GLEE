# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
