"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us both closer to where we want to be.",100.0,Alice,5,
