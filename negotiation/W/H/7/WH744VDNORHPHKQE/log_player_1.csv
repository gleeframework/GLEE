"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm starting the offer at $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  While $97 is tempting, I think I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us both closer to where we want to be."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
