"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm starting the offer at $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying below our $120 maximum.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere but also clearly states our desired price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we aim to understand Alice's lower price limit and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice decreased her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $105 is closer to our ideal price, we still have room to bargain and potentially get closer to $90.
* **Alternative Option:** We can always buy from John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not entirely happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a price that's roughly halfway between our previous offer ($90) and her current offer ($105). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel like a win-win for both parties.
* **Sense of Fairness:** By using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise,"" we emphasize that we're trying to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Strategic Movement:** We're still pushing towards our ideal price range while signaling that we're willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us both closer to where we want to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Valuation:** Alice has reached a price of $100, which we know is her perceived value of the product. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Good Deal:** We're getting the product for $20 less than our maximum budget and $20 less than John's offer. This is a significant saving.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might hold firm at $100, or we might accidentally lowball and lose the deal entirely."
