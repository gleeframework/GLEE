Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and direct message encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $1,000,000, I'm hoping to:

* Gauge Bob's interest. If he's genuinely interested, he's likely to counter-offer, allowing for further negotiation. 
* Keep the option to sell to John open.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can immediately sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am not able to meet your asking price of $1,000,000. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price through further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  This shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **Continue negotiation:** I can counter-offer with a price closer to my target, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  If negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't settle for an unfavorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still a bit lower than my target.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$975,000:** This price is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $950,000.
* **Message:** The message reiterates my desire for a fair price but also signals that I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he's being considered.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Move closer to my target:** While still below my minimum acceptable price, it's closer to my goal.
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a firm stance.
* **Increase the likelihood of closing the deal:** By proposing a concrete price, I'm pushing for a final decision from Bob, which will either lead to a sale or allow me to move on to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for revising your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the adjustment. However, I am still not able to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is only $15,000 lower than my last offer of $975,000.  This is a small enough difference that it's not worth risking further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Secure a sale:** This guarantees a sale at a price that's within a reasonable range of my desired price.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Additional negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price and could potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **Minimize risk:**  There's always the possibility that Bob might reject my counteroffer, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting his offer eliminates this risk.

While I'd ideally prefer to sell for $1,200,000, the $960,000 offer is still a good outcome, considering the potential risks involved with further negotiation."
