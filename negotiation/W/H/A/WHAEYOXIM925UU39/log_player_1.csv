Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $85 for it. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I can still get a better price from John if I don't reach an agreement with Bob.  I'll try to counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I can't go above $90 for the product. Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $95,  $90 is still a good price and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob.  Also, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
