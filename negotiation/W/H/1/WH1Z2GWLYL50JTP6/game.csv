"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value remains higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and my willingness to find a middle ground. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront about the value this product holds for me.  My final offer is $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm confident I can find another buyer at that price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
