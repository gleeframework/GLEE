"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  To be frank, $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we aim for $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find common ground. While I'm motivated to sell, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
