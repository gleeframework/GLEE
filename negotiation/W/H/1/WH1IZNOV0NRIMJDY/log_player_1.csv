Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a strong starting point that reflects the product's value to me, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested. 

Let's see what Bob offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try to get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price well above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident that I won't be able to get much higher.  It's a good deal for me, and I'll take it!"
