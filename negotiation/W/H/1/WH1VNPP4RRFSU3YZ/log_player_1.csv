Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will get. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can secure at least my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $10,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Backup Plan:** John remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  How about $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value this product offers, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my desired outcome but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that my offer is still fair, considering its worth to him.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and uses language that encourages a successful negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is now closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether, as Bob seems firm on his offer.
* **Potential for Profit:** While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable profit considering the value to Bob and the potential for more negotiation.
* **Time Constraints:**  I'm not sure how long John will wait, so I don't want to risk missing out on a sale.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point."
