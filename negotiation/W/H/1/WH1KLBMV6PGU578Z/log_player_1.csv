Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $850,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counteroffer, and you can adjust accordingly.
* **It's fair:** The offer is close to the product's worth to Bob, which increases the chances of a successful negotiation.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $820,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
