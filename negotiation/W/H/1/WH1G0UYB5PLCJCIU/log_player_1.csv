"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and encouraging tone aims to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives me a starting point for negotiating and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum price of $120.

**Note:** I'm still considering John's offer of $120 as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  Even though I'm looking to make a deal with Bob, I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation.** I still have 9 rounds to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $85 and my desired price point, keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps keep the negotiations open and encourages Bob to continue.

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to assess if I should continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $92 is a bit high. Can you meet me at $88? I'm willing to make a serious decision if you can meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While it's tempting to accept, I still have 6 rounds remaining. There's a chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, but it might be worth taking the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $90 or $92. I'll carefully consider the remaining rounds and my risk tolerance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm getting closer to your price. How about $90?  I'm really hoping to work something out with you, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my last offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $88. 
* **Finality:** I'm adding a hint of finality by saying I can't go lower, which might push Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll need to make a decision in the next round about whether to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. Can you meet me at $87? I'm willing to make a deal if you can meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to 4 rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential profit from continuing with Bob is shrinking, and there's no guarantee he will accept my next offer. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and ensures I meet my minimum requirement.

**Conclusion:**

While I was hopeful about making a deal with Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high at this point. Selling to John is the more logical and secure option."
