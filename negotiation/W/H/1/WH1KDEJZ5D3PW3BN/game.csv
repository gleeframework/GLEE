"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're on a budget, but $65 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $80?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",80.0,Alice,5,
