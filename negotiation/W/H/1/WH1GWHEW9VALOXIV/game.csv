"Hey Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's meet in the middle at $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make a deal at $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
