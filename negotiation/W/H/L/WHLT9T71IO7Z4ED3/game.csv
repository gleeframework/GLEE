"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value the product will bring to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,200. This is my final counteroffer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
