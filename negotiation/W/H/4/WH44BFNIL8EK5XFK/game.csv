"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $130? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $127.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.,127.5,Bob,4,
