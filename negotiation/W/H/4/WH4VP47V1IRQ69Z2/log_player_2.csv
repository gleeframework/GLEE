"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is less than your maximum budget of $100 and cheaper than buying from John for $100. Accepting the offer saves you the most money."
