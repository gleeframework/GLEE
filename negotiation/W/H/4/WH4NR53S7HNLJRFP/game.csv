"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,800, which still allows me to make a decent profit. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,650. It's a small step closer to your offer, and it allows me to keep a bit of margin.  What do you say?",8650.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500 is too high, and $8,650 is still a bit too much. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'm not going to go any higher. It's my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
