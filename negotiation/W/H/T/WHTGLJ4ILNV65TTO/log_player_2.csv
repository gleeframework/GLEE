**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer, but not good enough.** You can get the product for $50,000 less if you reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  While you could accept Alice's offer and save $50,000 compared to John, there's still potential to get the product for a lower price. 
* **Rejecting the offer leaves the door open for negotiation.** You can potentially counter-offer Alice or wait for her to offer a lower price."
