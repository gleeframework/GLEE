Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher ($1,200,000) creates room for negotiation and potential profit beyond the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Justification for the Price:**  The message doesn't explicitly state Bob's valuation, but implies the product is worth a premium by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value.""
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate. If he outright rejects this high price, Alice hasn't lost anything and can still fall back on John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Depending on Bob's response, Alice may need to adjust her price during negotiations."
