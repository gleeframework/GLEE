Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Secure a Deal:** While you have John as a backup buyer, it's always better to secure the best possible price upfront. 
 
By offering the product at $9,500, you aim to capture the majority of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
