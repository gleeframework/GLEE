"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is $800,000. This is the price he can get from John, so it's his baseline.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes Bob's position and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  While $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's no reason to buy from Alice at that price when John offers a lower price.  Rejecting and continuing negotiations could potentially lead to a more favorable offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $900,000.  He's already made it clear he's willing to pay no more than $800,000, so this offer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This could potentially entice Alice to counteroffer closer to Bob's preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a more favorable offer from Alice. He still has 5 rounds left to negotiate with her before he needs to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but cautiously.  He's shown his willingness to pay up to $900,000, so increasing to $950,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This could incentivize Alice to make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  While $1,025,000 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John.  He has only 3 rounds left before he needs to make a decision.  There's still time to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer could lead to a more favorable offer from Alice or, at the very least, will give him the chance to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but cautiously. He's shown his willingness to pay up to $950,000, so increasing to $975,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This could incentivize Alice to make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price.  He has only 2 rounds left to negotiate with Alice before he needs to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $800,000 from John. He only has one round left to negotiate with Alice.  There's still time to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer could lead to a more favorable offer from Alice or, at the very least, will give him the chance to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

Bob should make a final counteroffer of $990,000.  He's shown his willingness to pay up to $975,000, so this represents a significant compromise while still staying within his budget. It's likely Alice will accept this offer, as she's already come down significantly from her initial price. If she rejects, Bob can always fall back to buying from John."
