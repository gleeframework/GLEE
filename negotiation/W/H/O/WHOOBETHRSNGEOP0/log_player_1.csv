Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $145 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100) but might be tempting enough to consider, especially if you highlight the product's value proposition. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
