As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair profit for you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
