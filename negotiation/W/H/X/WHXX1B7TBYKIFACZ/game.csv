"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desire to sell the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to you, while still allowing me to get a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a little outside my comfort zone. How about $1,025,000?  This would allow me to secure the product while still ensuring I stay within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
