"I'm very interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality and features.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $7500 is a more comfortable price for me. Can you consider this offer?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a premium, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, which is the minimum I can sell the product for. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
