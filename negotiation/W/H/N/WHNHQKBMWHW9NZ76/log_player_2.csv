Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product, while also being reasonable for you.

While $16,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your $12,000 limit."

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $15,500.

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While the negotiation has progressed, you're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $12,000.  It's likely that Alice will not budge further."
