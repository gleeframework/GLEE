"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer so we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still allow me to make a decent profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I've got 6 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less than I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $105 is a fair price for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum than before, I still have a few rounds left and I'm not desperate to close the deal. I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer to my price point, I'd really like to get at least $100 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $100 is the best deal for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $150.  I'm going to sell to John and move on."
