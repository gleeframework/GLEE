"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This would still allow me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $105 is a fair price for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer to my price point, I'd really like to get at least $100 for this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $100 is the best deal for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,85.0,Bob,8,
