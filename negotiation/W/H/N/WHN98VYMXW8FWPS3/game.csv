"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Considering our mutual interests, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
