"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Considering our mutual interests, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

* Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save $100,000."
