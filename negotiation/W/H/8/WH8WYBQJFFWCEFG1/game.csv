"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I've done my research and I believe it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. Would you be open to $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while working within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. It seems we're getting closer. How about we settle on $780,000? That reflects a compromise we can both be happy with.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",815000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm finding it difficult to justify going over $800,000. Would you consider $795,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $795,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $812,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",812500.0,Alice,9,
