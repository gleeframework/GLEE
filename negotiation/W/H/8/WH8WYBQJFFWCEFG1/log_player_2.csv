# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I've done my research and I believe it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

{
""message"": ""Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm finding it difficult to justify going over $800,000. Would you consider $795,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase."",

Round 9
Alice's offer:

I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a fair price.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's getting too risky.  Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $800,000.  We're in the final rounds, and she might not budge much. Accepting $812,500 guarantees a good deal without the risk of missing out entirely."
