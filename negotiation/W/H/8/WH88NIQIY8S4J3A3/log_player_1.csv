Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $175?  I believe this price still offers you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $150? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum price, but I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is also willing to pay that amount.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Bob, as I'm guaranteed to get my desired price by selling to John."
