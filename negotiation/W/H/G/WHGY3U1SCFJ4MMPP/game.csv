"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I can offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can offer you a slight discount at $845,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a compromise, and I believe it's the best price we can both agree on at this point. What do you think?",845000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $845,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $825,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to complete the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
