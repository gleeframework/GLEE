Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See how interested he is and if he's willing to pay above the $12,000 mark.
2. **Leave Room for Bargaining:** You can always negotiate down if needed, ensuring you don't miss out on the sale.

Remember, you have a safety net with John, so don't be afraid to aim high with Bob!"
