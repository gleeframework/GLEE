Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while allowing for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my reach.  I'm happy to go up to $900,000 for this product.  It's a significant investment for me, and this is the highest I can go at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's unlikely Bob will reach that price in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer is the most rational decision to maximize profit."
