Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since the product is worth $150 to Bob and we know we have a guaranteed sale at that price with John, starting higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter-offer:**  The message is phrased in a way that invites Bob to respond and potentially negotiate. 
* **Highlighting potential value to Bob:** By mentioning that the product is valuable to Bob specifically, we might increase his perceived value of the item.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase the product at a price he finds acceptable."
