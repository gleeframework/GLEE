"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $2,000,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my price range.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I need to see a significant increase for this deal to make sense for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
