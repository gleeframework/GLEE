Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my price range.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob is still very far from a reasonable offer.  We need to signal we're willing to walk away soon if he doesn't significantly increase his offer."
