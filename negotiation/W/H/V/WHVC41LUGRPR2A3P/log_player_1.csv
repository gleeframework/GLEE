Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm leaving myself room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's close to John's offer:**  If Bob rejects, I can quickly turn to John and secure my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is above Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a great price for you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my ideal price point. It's time to cut my losses and move on. Selling to John for $150 guarantees my desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
