"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500? That's a very fair offer for a product of this quality.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
