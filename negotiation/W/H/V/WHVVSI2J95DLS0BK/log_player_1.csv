Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be impressed."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $7,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500? That's a very fair offer for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a significant risk he'll walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at my minimum price."
