"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints but I can't go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $142.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",142.5,Bob,4,
