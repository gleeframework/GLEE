"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high bar and allows room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** I'm maintaining a confident and positive tone, aiming to instill a sense of value and opportunity in Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the process.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  This offer leaves the door open for me to switch to John if Bob rejects it, reminding him of the potential loss if he delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, making it unfavorable. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There is still room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to go higher than his initial value of $800,000. 
* **Time Constraint:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore better options. Selling to John immediately would mean leaving potential profit on the table.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Win-Win:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, where both of us can be happy with the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm hoping this counter-offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering it's a more reasonable step down from my initial offer. 
* If he rejects it, I'll continue negotiating, keeping in mind the possibility of switching to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want to split the difference, but I'm not comfortable going up to $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $900000, which would be $975000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is a Factor:** While I could potentially get a better price, time is running out. I've already had four rounds of negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 offers a guaranteed outcome, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer and the deal falling through.

**Next Steps:**  

* **Counter-Offer:** I will counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, but keeping in mind the urgency of the situation.
* **Close to Agreement:**  I will aim for a price that Bob will likely accept, as the potential profit is not significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this now and avoid any further delays."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, representing my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing this point to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the need to close the deal quickly to avoid further delays.
* **Win-Win:** I'm framing this as a final opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:**  If Bob accepts this offer, the deal is closed. 
* **Sell to John:** If he rejects it, I'll move on to selling the product to John to ensure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're now in round 6, and the negotiation is becoming increasingly drawn out. There are only 4 rounds remaining.
* **No Significant Gain:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 higher than his initial counteroffer. This is not a significant enough increase to justify the risk of further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and avoids the potential for a deal to fall through with Bob.

**Conclusion:** 

Given the time constraints and the lack of a significant improvement in Bob's offer, it's more prudent to sell to John at this point. The guaranteed $1,000,000 is a secure outcome and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
