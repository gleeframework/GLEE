"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Interest:**  I'm framing the message as if I think Bob would value the product highly, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"" 

This strategy aims to establish a good starting point while leaving the door open for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only commit to $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can offer a slightly higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** While John is a guaranteed sale, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a more favorable outcome while also keeping John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $115? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Motivating Acceptance:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to incentivize Bob to accept.

This approach aims to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation moving while still seeking a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. Considering my budget, I can only commit to $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer is only $5 below my previous counteroffer. This is getting very close to my desired price range.
* **Risk of Losing Value:**  If I continue to reject offers, there's a good chance I'll end up selling to John for $100, which is my minimum. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With 6 rounds left, I'm getting closer to the deadline. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and prevents the risk of getting a worse deal later.

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting this offer seems like the best option to maximize my earnings considering the current situation."
