Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. Let's try $825,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests, and I think you'll find it a great deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and we're getting close to her likely bottom line. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll dig in, and I'd end up paying John's $1,000,000 price. Accepting at $825,000 secures a $175,000 savings compared to John's offer, which is a significant amount."
