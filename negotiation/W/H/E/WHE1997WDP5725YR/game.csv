"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to work with you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
