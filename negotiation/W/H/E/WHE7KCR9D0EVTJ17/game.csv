"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire to save money.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows you a considerable profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
