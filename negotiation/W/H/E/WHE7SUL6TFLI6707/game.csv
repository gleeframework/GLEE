"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in a product like this.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in a product like this.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
