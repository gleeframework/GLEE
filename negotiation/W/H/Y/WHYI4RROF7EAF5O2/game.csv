"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. While $750,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's still within your budget. Let's find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $775,000 is still too far off for me. I'm offering one last compromise at $800,000. It's my absolute minimum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value of this product. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to consider other options. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
