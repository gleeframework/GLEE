{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows for some flexibility on my end. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my desired minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my target. I believe this counteroffer shows flexibility and might lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise that gets me closer to my goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
