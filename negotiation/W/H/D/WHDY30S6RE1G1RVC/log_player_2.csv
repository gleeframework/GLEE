Round 2

""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but it needs to be significantly lower to make sense for me. How about $60?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'll meet you halfway between $75 and $120, so I'm offering it to you for $97.50. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  While $97.50 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I can do $80, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 80
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'll meet you at $90, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand.  She's unlikely to go lower than $90, and you've already hit your target price with John's offer. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if you can get the product for your ideal price elsewhere."
