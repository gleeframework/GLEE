"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice has come down from $14,000 to $13,000, making the deal more attractive.
* **It's still a better deal than buying from John:**  $13,000 is $2,000 less than buying from John. 
* **There's a risk in continuing to negotiate:**  Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up buying from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,000 is the most logical choice for Bob."
