"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your limit, you can likely get a better price. You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you are serious about buying the product but are also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $130.  Would you consider $135? I'm trying to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is right in the middle of your desired price range and her previous offer. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that is both acceptable and advantageous, especially considering you have limited rounds left. There's a chance you could get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential gains."
