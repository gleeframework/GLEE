"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, as it's a good starting point that's above my minimum but still within the realm of what Bob might be willing to pay.  I'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $115. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $110. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a good deal considering the time constraints.  It's also more than what I'd get selling to John.  I'm happy with the outcome!"
