"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $10,000. You have a maximum budget of $12,000, and you can negotiate with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but still leaves a profit margin for her, as her minimum is $8,000.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also maximizing my potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is within my budget and a better price than John's offer of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my next offer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the current offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price within my budget."
