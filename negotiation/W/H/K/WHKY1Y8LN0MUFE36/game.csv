"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my limits and the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
