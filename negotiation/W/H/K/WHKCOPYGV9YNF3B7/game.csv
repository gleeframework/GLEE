"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. This price is fair for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $90. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope it's something you'll consider.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. This is a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's close the deal.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $87.50 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $88.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",88.5,Alice,7,
