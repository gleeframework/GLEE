{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$150 is way over my budget of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $80, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully get her attention and signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I'm willing to pay up to $100 if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95, which is closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. Hopefully, this will be a more palatable offer for Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$125 is still a bit too high, and I'm getting close to the halfway point of my negotiations. I'm going to push for a better deal with another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
