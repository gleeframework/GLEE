"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Would you be open to that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over budget at $115. Would you consider $110? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
