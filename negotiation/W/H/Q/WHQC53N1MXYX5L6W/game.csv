"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,050,000 is just a touch too high for me. How about we settle at $1,025,000 and call it a deal?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $1,025,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $1,075,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really close here, but I need you to meet me in the middle.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $1,030,000, but that's the best I can do.  It's a fair offer, and I think it's time we close this deal.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,030,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,080,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
