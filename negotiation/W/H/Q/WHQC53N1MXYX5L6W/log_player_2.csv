# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to go up a bit, but $1,050,000 is just a touch too high for me. How about we settle at $1,025,000 and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $1,025,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $1,075,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice is trying to inch back up. We're getting close to the point where it might be better to go with John.  Let's hold firm for one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're really close here, but I need you to meet me in the middle.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to $1,030,000, but that's the best I can do.  It's a fair offer, and I think it's time we close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1030000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,030,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,080,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly not going to budge. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John. While it's not ideal to pay $1,500,000, it's better than getting stuck in an endless loop with Alice and potentially paying even more."
