"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and your specific use case, sits significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, which would be $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
