Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, our goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price could result in a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $950,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room for negotiation.
    * It's still a substantial discount from John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and appealing to Bob's potential gain."
