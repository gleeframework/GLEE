"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its worth to you.  I'm confident this product will be highly beneficial for your operations. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying for the product, considering its value to me is $800,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable asset. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? This price still allows you to acquire the product at a significant discount while also providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial solution, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price",900000.0,Bob,4,
