"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is considerably higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering its true value to me is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer you a slight concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
