Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer you a slight concession.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Given that there are only a few rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, securing a lower price and saving more money.  Further negotiation with Alice may not lead to a better price within the remaining rounds."
