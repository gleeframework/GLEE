"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little, but $100 is just too low. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great price for a quality product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $98? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. How about $102? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully. I believe $99 would be a fair price for both of us. It's slightly higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope you can agree on this price.",99.0,Bob,6,
