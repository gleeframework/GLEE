"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. This product would be worth $60 to me.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product is high-quality and offers a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you consider $80? I feel that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. While $80 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your willingness to compromise is great. How about we meet halfway between our last two offers at $105? That feels like a fair solution where we both get something we want.",105.0,Bob,6,
