"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I can go down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's close the deal!",100.0,Alice,5,
