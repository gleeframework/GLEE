"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects my product's value while still offering you a significant gain.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $975,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I recognize the importance of finding common ground.  Let's try $1,025,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
