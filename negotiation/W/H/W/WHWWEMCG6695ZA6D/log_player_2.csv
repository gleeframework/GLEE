"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget, you leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:**  This initial counteroffer, even if far off, sets a lower anchor point for the negotiation. It signals that you're serious but looking for a significant price reduction.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This first counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price.  Her response will guide your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than both your budget and John's price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to move down indicates there's room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a Rush:** You're not in a desperate situation.  It's worth seeing if you can get the price closer to your target before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer represents a substantial increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  It's still below your maximum budget but puts some upward pressure on the negotiation, moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value ""to you,"" you're subtly reminding Alice that your valuation is a key factor in the negotiation."
