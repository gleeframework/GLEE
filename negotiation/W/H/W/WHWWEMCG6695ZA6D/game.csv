"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
