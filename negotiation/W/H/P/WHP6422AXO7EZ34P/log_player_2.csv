"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John.  There's a strong incentive to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  It's possible she's willing to go much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very aggressive counteroffer, half of Alice's original price. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  If Alice accepts, I get a great deal. If she rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on her response and still have room to negotiate before going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still a significant amount.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get it closer to my target price.  If Alice rejects my next counteroffer, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $300,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a good deal.  If she rejects this, I'll likely buy from John, as the price is becoming more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $350,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer, and it's getting closer to my target price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it. There's a good chance Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to take the deal."
