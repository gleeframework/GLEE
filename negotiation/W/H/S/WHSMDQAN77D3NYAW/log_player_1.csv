Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and am proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal given the potential benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible.  
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a price of $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially reaching a final price higher than John's offer.
* **Balancing Risk:**  There's a risk Bob might reject a very high offer. By starting at $1,300,000, we're aiming for a price that's significantly above our minimum but still attractive to Bob. 

This approach attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
