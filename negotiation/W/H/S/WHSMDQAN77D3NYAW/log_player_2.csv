"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've carefully considered its worth and am proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair deal given the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm looking to save some money. Since Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,500,000), I'll accept it.
