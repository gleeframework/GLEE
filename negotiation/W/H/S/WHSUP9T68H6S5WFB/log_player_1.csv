I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $9,000 is still too low. I'm going to try to get closer to $10,000, as that's the minimum I'm willing to sell for."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.
