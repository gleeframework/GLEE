{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and show that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to pay more than $80, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can still do better with Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $105 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal for me. It's more than what I would get from John, and it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  I'm confident that we've reached a good compromise."
