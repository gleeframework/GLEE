"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  It's a fair price and would be a win-win for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get.  Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
