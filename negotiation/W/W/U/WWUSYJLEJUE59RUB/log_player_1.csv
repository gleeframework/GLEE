Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  It's a fair price and would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation.  John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is more than my minimum and secures my profit.  I'll take the safe route and sell to John."
