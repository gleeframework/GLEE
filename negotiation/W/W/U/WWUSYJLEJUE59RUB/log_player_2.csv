"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price since there's a decent margin between her valuation and your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  It's a fair price and would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $7,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, it's important to start negotiations below your target price to give yourself room to negotiate upward.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""a bit steep for me"") can make it seem less arbitrary and potentially encourage Alice to engage in good faith.
* **Seeking Win-Win:**  Emphasizing a ""win-win"" outcome helps to maintain a positive tone and suggests that a mutually beneficial deal is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it's closer to what I need to get.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for $8,000 or less, and accepting $8,500 would leave potential savings on the table. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments, showing willingness to compromise but not caving in immediately.
* **Target Price in Mind:** $7,750 is a strategic offer. It's halfway between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, keeping the negotiation moving while still aiming below our $8,000 target.
* **Positive Language:** Maintaining a collaborative tone (""working with me,"" ""fair compromise"") encourages a mutually agreeable outcome."
