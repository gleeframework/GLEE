Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob it's worth the price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers exist), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your absolute minimum is $10,000."
