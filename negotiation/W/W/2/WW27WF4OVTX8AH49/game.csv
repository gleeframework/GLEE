"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1000000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $975000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $925000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $875000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately need to move forward with another seller.",875000.0,Bob,6,
