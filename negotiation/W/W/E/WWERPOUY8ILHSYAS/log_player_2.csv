{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. There's a chance Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is still within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear lower limit for him."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,800 is still within Bob's budget and represents a decent saving compared to Alice's initial offer.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating even lower, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling apart entirely is present. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
