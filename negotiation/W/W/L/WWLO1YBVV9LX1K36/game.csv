"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy now.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $135, Bob. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $132.50? It's a good middle ground, and I'm willing to make it work.",132.5,Alice,5,
