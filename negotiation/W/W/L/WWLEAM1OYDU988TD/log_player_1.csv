"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, which might make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and allows me to adjust my price if necessary. 
* **Not selling immediately to John:**  I want to maximize my profit and explore potential for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $100 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he is interested. There's still room for me to counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **Not selling to John yet:**  I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still leaves me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $125.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $125 is still above Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $110? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still hopeful of securing a higher price.
* **Not selling to John yet:**  There are still rounds left, and I'm not desperate enough to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $115. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm showing continued willingness to compromise by only lowering the price by $10 from my previous offer. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair to both of us to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Last chance:**  I'm making it clear that this might be my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could you perhaps consider $110 as a final offer? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We're now in round 6, meaning only 4 rounds remain. 
* **Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, it's likely he won't budge much further.
* **Guaranteeing profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum requirement.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks further time and effort without a guarantee of a better offer. 

I've decided to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure a profitable sale."
