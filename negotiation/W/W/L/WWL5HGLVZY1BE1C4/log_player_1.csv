Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a significant amount, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") rather than demanding, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.

By starting at $15,500, Alice gives herself room to potentially:

* Secure a price significantly above her minimum.
* Negotiate down slightly and still receive a price higher than John's offer. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice hasn't lost anything and can still fall back on John's guaranteed $12,000."
