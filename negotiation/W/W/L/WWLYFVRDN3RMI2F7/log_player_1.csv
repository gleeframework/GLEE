Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a profit for Alice. 
* **High Initial Offer:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, it sets a strong anchor price. If Bob is interested, he's more likely to counter with a price closer to $149 than if Alice started lower."
