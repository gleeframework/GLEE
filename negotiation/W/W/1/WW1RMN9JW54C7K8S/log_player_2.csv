While I understand its worth to you is significantly higher, I'm willing to negotiate a price that's fair to both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This allows you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $800000.
