"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still too expensive for you. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to try to get a better price. 
* **Buy from John is a backup:** You're not desperate to buy from Alice, so you can use the threat of buying from John to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  A $100 offer is a 17% reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** You're still willing to pay more than Alice's value ($80), making this a reasonable starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** There's still room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but you've made it clear you won't settle for her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your desired price, $130 is still higher than what you're comfortable with.
* **More negotiation is needed:**  You still have 7 rounds left, so you have time to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option:** This gives you bargaining power, allowing you to press Alice for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $100 and Alice's offer of $130.
* **Shows Flexibility:**  It shows that you are willing to negotiate and move closer to Alice's position, but you still want a better price.
* **Pressure:**  With 6 rounds remaining, this counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While getting closer to your upper limit, $140 is still significantly higher than what you're aiming for.
* **More negotiation is possible:** With 5 rounds left, you have time to try and get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option:** This provides leverage to encourage Alice to make a more competitive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is a final compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer of $140 and your previous offer of $110.
* **High Stakes:** With only 4 rounds remaining, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Acceptable Price:** While it's higher than your ideal price, it's still within your budget and significantly less than the alternative of buying from John for $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** Only 3 rounds left, and Alice is not budging significantly.
* **Unfavorable Offer:** Alice's offer of $142 is very close to John's price of $150. There is minimal benefit to continuing negotiation.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a risk of the negotiation failing entirely, leaving you with no product.

It's better to cut your losses and buy from John.  While it's not your ideal price, it's a guaranteed purchase and avoids the risk of a prolonged and potentially fruitless negotiation."
