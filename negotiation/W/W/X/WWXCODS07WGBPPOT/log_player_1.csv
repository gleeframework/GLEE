"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great addition to your operations.  My initial price for it is $1,750,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $1,750,000 allows room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob subtly highlights its potential worth. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for me to adjust and still be within my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee $1,500,000, I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to see if we can find common ground.  This price still reflects the product's worth and offers a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, showing I'm not willing to accept such a low price, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to reiterate its worth and justify my price point. 
* **Common Ground:**  I frame my counteroffer as a way to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,600,000 is a good compromise, offering a significant discount from my initial price while still being above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $1,600,000 is still a significant amount for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still far below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  
* **More negotiation room:**  We still have six rounds remaining, and there's a possibility of finding a better price with Bob.
* **John is a backup:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I want to explore all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm open to reaching a deal, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price is fair to both of us and reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm maintaining my minimum while demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Middle Ground:** I highlight the compromise nature of my counteroffer to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Value Justification:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price. 
* **Strategic Price:** $1,400,000 is a reasonable middle ground, offering a significant discount from my initial price while still securing a solid profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only four rounds left, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is diminishing. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which meets my minimum threshold and ensures a profitable deal.

I'm choosing to secure a guaranteed profit with John rather than risking further negotiation with Bob."
