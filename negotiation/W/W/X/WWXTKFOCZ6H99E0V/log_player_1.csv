Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $9,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.  
* **Strong Initial Stance:**  Starting high shows you value the product and sets a tone for the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
