Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum value. I will try to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $105, which is still above my minimum and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his offer of $100. Since I'm not willing to go lower than that and I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
