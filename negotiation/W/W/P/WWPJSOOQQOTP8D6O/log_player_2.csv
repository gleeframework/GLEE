# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the value this product holds. I believe this price is still fair and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to John."
