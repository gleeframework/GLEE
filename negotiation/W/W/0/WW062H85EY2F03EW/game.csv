"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I have to be more realistic about its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our respective needs.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the value I deserve. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
