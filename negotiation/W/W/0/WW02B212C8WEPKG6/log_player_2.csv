"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's true you value the product at $12,000, but you know John will sell it to you for that price.  There's an opportunity to get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or waiting to see if she lowers her price."
