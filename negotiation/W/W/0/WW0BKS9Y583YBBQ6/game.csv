"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth anywhere near $2,300,000. I'd be willing to start the conversation around $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. While I understand your perspective, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this demonstrates my desire to make a deal while still valuing what I'm bringing to the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. This product has value, but I need to be realistic about my budget. To keep this moving, I could consider something around $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a way to make this work. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a strong commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I can see this product being valuable to my business, but $1,600,000 is just not feasible.  If you're truly serious about making a deal, I could go up to $800,000. That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value it brings to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. I've also been upfront about the value of this product to me. To be completely candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're able to meet me at this point.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
