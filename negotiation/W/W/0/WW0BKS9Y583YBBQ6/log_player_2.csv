I can see this product being valuable to my business, but $1,600,000 is just not feasible.  If you're truly serious about making a deal, I could go up to $800,000. That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value it brings to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. I've also been upfront about the value of this product to me. To be completely candid, $1,500,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're able to meet me at this point.

Alice has shown she is unlikely to move below $1,500,000.  Since you can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes the most financial sense to go with that option and save the money."
