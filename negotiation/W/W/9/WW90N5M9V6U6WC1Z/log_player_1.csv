Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach $8,000, and further negotiation might be more time-consuming than it's worth. John provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
