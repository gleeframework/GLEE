Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency and significant value for Bob. It's substantially less than my minimum but still a considerable profit.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" it subtly reminds Bob that he might miss out if he doesn't act quickly, even though John is offering the same amount. 

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
