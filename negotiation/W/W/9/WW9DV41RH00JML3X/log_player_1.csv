Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $100. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why:

* **Starting High:** It's common in negotiations to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you're subtly suggesting the product might be worth even more than $100 to Bob.

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses to maximize the selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd like to save some money. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $70 is quite low for the quality of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel like a compromise to both parties. 
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Quality:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $75, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still below my ideal price, it's better to accept the $75 than risk him walking away entirely.  At this point, the difference between his offer and selling to John is minimal, and continuing to negotiate might sour the deal."
