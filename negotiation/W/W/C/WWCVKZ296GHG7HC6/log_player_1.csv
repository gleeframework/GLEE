Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. I'm asking for $15,000, which reflects the true value of this unique item."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to meet in the middle or hold firm.
* **Justify the Price:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal John's offer, it emphasizes the ""true value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's personality, negotiation style, and how badly you want to secure the higher sale."
