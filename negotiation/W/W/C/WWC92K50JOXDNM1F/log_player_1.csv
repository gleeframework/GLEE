"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. This approach balances maximizing your profit with the need to potentially reach a deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this point. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great value for you, and it gives us both a good starting point for a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I am still unwilling to sell at a loss. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price. The time pressure is building, but I am determined to get as close to my minimum as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to get closer to my minimum price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $12,800, and I think that's the maximum I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob stubbornly refusing to budge, the risk of failing to reach a deal within the 10 rounds is significant. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
