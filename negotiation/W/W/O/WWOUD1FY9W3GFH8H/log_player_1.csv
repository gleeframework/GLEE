I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $10,000, and it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will try to negotiate a higher price."

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer and a decent compromise. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer."

I'm offering $11,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a fair price."
