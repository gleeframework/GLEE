"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he has an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and saves time."
