"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  Since he's willing to pay up to $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $130. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $130, Bob. I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to John's $150 offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or the deal will take too long to finalize.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids unnecessary delay."
