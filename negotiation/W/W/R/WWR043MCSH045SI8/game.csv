"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? This price still gives you a significant value for the product, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This price is still a significant premium for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
