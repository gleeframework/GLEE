Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and hopefully get her closer to my maximum budget.  It's a risky move, but it could potentially lead to a faster deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to avoid overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable middle ground that could potentially be acceptable to Alice, while still staying within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her to come down further. I still have several rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my financial goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by $150,000. This demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still committed to saving as much money as possible. It's a calculated risk, hoping that Alice will see my willingness to compromise and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get her down further. It's risky, but I have two more rounds to get a better deal. I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm pushing for my maximum budget, but I believe it's a fair price given the ongoing negotiation and Alice's previous offers.  If Alice rejects this, I'm ready to buy from John at $1,500,000, as I'm confident I won't get a better deal with Alice."
