"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your limit.  Therefore, it's better to reject her offer and buy from John for the lower price."
