Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $800,000.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $750,000. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking $775,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to our partnership if we can agree on this price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While his offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I want to see if I can get a little higher before resorting to selling to John. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $800,000, which is $787,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm excited about the potential partnership.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. We've reached the 8th round and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will agree to my minimum price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
