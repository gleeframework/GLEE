Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering the value I see in it. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than the product's worth.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to accept $750,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, my minimum price is $850,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers.  I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product.  I'm committed to reaching a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation or going to John when I can secure the deal with Bob at $800,000."
