Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to counteroffer since he values the product higher. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price might scare Bob away, and a lower price might leave too much money on the table. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I initially offered. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. How about $9,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up a bit to $9,250.  While it's not my initial asking price, it's a good compromise and within the range I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the deal."
