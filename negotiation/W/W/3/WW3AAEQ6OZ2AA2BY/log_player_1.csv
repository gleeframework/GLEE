Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll appreciate its potential. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice aims to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, knowing he has a strong incentive to buy if the price is below that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly, even though Alice has a guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This strategy involves a slight risk. If Bob rejects the $1,150,000 offer, Alice has to settle for $1,000,000 from John.
* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice has any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive bargainer), she might adjust her initial offer accordingly."
