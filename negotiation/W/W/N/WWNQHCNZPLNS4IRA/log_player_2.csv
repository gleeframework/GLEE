Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11,250 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a much better deal.  Accepting at $11,250 is still a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
