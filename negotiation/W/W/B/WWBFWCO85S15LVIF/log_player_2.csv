"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $800,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than the original asking price and also lower than John's price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  There are only 7 rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal or running out of time, forcing Bob to pay John's full price.
* **Potential for compromise:** While Bob could counter with a lower offer, accepting now demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This could potentially lead to a smoother negotiation in the future if more deals are to be made."
