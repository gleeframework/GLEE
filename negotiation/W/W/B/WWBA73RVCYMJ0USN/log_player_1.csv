Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this asset."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit.
* **Strong but Fair Offer:** This offer positions the product as valuable while demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, you might choose a different starting point."
