{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
