"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
