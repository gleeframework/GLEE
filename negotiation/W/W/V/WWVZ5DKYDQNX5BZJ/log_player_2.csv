{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for potential compromise.  By offering a lower price, I'm signaling my seriousness about purchasing the product while also pushing for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but still pushing for a price closer to my ideal target.  $800,000 is a compromise, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept it.  If not, we'll continue negotiating in the next round."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While I'm starting to get concerned about time, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $850,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This price is still within my budget, but it's a lot closer to Alice's last offer, indicating that I'm serious about closing the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is inching closer to my maximum, but I'm still not willing to accept it. We've reached a point where the risk of not finding a deal with Alice is high, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer. If Alice rejects it, I'll seriously consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm pushing the limit of my budget, but I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Alice has been steadily increasing her price, so I'm hoping this counteroffer will bridge the gap. If she rejects it, I'm prepared to buy from John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice is too high. Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still too high. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. Even though I'm paying $1,000,000, it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
