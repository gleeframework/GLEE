{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and has the potential to be incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000 before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible from Bob, but we need to offer him a price he might accept. 
* **The Strategy:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while ensuring a substantial profit for you, Alice. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you're still in a strong position to accept John's offer and achieve your minimum desired price."
