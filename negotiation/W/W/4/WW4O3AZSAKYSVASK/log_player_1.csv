Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob before selling to John.  While $1,350,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,400,000?  That gives you a great deal, and it gets us closer to where we need to be. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,380,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for more, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1,420,000. This is a good compromise, and it gives us both a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1420000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in coming down, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable value that it's worth accepting.  While I could continue negotiating, I risk Bob walking away altogether or me having to sell to John at a lower price than I'd hoped.  It's better to take a good deal now than to risk losing out entirely."
