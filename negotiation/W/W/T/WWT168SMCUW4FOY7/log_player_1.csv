{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still a decent discount from my minimum, but it's a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer. While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement within a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a lower price than my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, and closer to a compromise.  I'm hoping this will be a good enough offer for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is close enough to my target price that I'm going to accept it.  While I could get $15,000 from John, I'm happy to close the deal with Bob and avoid further negotiation."
