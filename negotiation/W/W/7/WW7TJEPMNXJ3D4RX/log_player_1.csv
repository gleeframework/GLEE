Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. Offering a price significantly higher than your minimum ($18,000 vs. $12,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to both of you helps justify the price.
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of securing a price higher than John's offer.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees enough value in the product to accept."
