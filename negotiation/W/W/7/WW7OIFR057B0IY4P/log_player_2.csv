It's not worth buying from Alice at $900,000 when you can get it from John for $800,000. It's better to reject and counteroffer to save money."

I'm offering Alice $750,000. This is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the alternative of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but it's still too high. I will reject and counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $800,000."

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay John $800,000, so this is my absolute limit. If Alice doesn't accept this price, I'll go with John."
