"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $825,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,5,
