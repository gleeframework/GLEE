"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's likely he can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $105 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's closer to his budget, Bob still believes there's room for negotiation and can likely get a better deal by continuing the process.  He also has the option to buy from John as a fallback, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has rejected Alice's previous offer of $125, indicating his willingness to pay more than his initial counteroffer of $105 but still less than Alice's current offer.  Offering $115 represents a compromise, showing that he is serious about negotiating while still aiming to keep the price lower than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is closer to Bob's budget than her previous offers, but it's still above his target price.  He has already rejected offers higher than this, indicating a willingness to walk away if the price doesn't meet his needs.  Since he has the option to purchase from John for $150, there's no immediate pressure to accept this offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily increasing his counteroffers, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but also aiming to save money.  $120 represents a significant compromise from his previous offer of $115, and it's a reasonable price considering Alice's recent offer of $130.  This counteroffer is within Bob's budget while still leaving some room for negotiation. It also signals a strong intent to close the deal, potentially influencing Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, he's already rejected a higher offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and Alice's offers are trending downward.  Bob can continue to push for a better price, especially since he has the fallback option of buying from John. By rejecting, he can potentially reach a more favorable price within his budget without risking losing the opportunity to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily increasing his offers, demonstrating his willingness to close the deal. Alice has also been lowering her offers, showing a willingness to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $125 is a compromise that is within Bob's budget and might be attractive to Alice.  It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming to save money.  This could be a good point to reach a deal before Alice's next counteroffer or Bob has to choose John as his seller."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is only $10 lower than John's price. There's only one round left, and the negotiation hasn't yielded a significant decrease in Alice's price.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy from John, he should go with the safer choice and buy from John.  He's already spent time negotiating and is unlikely to get a better deal from Alice in the final round.  It's more cost-effective to buy from John and avoid further potential losses."
