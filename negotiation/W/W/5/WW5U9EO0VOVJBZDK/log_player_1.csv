{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring a significant profit margin for you.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the need to secure a deal, maximizing your potential earnings."
