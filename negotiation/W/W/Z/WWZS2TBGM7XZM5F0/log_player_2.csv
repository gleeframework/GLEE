Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product but my maximum budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $13000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $14500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer, he can still do better. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  Since John is offering the product for $12,000, Bob has a solid baseline to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm making a final concession, and I hope you'll meet me at this price. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $14,000. While this is closer to his budget, it's still higher than John's offer, and Bob has only 3 rounds left.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 deal from John than risk Alice rejecting his counteroffer again."
