Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but I'm trying to establish a lower price point from the beginning."

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'm willing to keep rejecting offers until I feel the price is closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, and this is a good sign. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price. There's still time to negotiate, and I don't want to settle for a price that's higher than I think is reasonable."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to Alice's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible, so I'm only going to increase my offer by a small amount.  I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying the product and will be willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now very close to my desired price. We're only $15,000 apart. Considering we're nearing the end of the negotiations and have limited rounds left, accepting this offer is the best option. I'm confident that this is the best deal I can get without risking losing the product altogether and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
