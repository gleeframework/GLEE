Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $135 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation to see if I can get a good starting point. I'll adjust based on his reaction in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept anything below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $115.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go as low as $100, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk going through more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $120."
