``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for flexibility in the negotiation and increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm going to counteroffer Bob again to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
