"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  That offer is much too high for me to consider. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's as high as I can go right now.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving on price, but $650,000 is simply too far from where I see the value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair one given the product's worth.  If this doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll likely pursue other opportunities.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I can go up to $720,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If we can't make a deal at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",720000.0,Bob,6,
