Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $12,000. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000. This means I have a safety net in case my offer is too high for Bob.

This strategy balances the potential for higher profit with the risk of rejection."
