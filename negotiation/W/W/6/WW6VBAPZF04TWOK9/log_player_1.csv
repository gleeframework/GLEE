Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also positions the product as a significant purchase, potentially making Bob feel he's getting a ""deal"" compared to a higher, publicly listed price. 
* **Respecting Bob's Value:** While you know the product's worth less to Bob, offering a price closer to his perceived value ($8,000) is unlikely to be successful.  

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk to maximize potential profit. You have a safety net with John."
