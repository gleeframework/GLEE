Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $150 is my minimum, I know the product is worth more than that to me.  I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent discount from my initial offer, but it's closer to what I think the product is worth.  Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160.  While it's still lower than my initial asking price, it's a good compromise and closer to my target than selling to John.  We've had a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
