Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price that is as close to my minimum value ($150) as possible while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I'm prepared to counter his offer, but ultimately, I'm willing to sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $150. I'm not desperate to sell and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $120, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($110). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and acknowledging Bob's interest. I'm also emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to increase the chances of acceptance. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, but I'm aiming to close the gap and make a deal as quickly as possible. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate whether it's better to go with John's offer or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $115? That's as low as I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, hoping to push him closer to my desired price. If he continues to refuse, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $118 as a final compromise. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $118, which is a small compromise from my previous offer but still closer to my desired price than Bob's. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while emphasizing the finality of my offer. I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept, knowing that he's already shown interest and made several counteroffers. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure I meet my minimum selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away from the deal, but I'll make one last offer. I'll meet you at $110. That's my final and best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it seems he's unlikely to budge further, and I risk losing time and potentially lowering my price even more. Selling to John for $150 guarantees I reach my minimum goal and avoid further hassle."
