**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though the product is worth $15,000 to him, Alice's offer of $14,995 allows him to save $5.  While it's a small amount, it's still a benefit. Since buying from John would cost the full $15,000, accepting Alice's offer is the better choice."
