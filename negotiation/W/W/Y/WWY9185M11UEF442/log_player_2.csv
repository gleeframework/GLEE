"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her last offer.  While you *might* be able to squeeze a few thousand more in savings by haggling further, it's getting risky.  John offers a sure thing at $1,000,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings."
