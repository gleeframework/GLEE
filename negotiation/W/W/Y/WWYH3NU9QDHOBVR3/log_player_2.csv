You're still above your desired price point, but closer to it. Keep negotiating to see if you can get closer to $6,800."

I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I'm offering it to you for $7,100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for this product.

Alice has come down to $7,100, which is a good price considering your goal is to save as much as possible. It's only $300 more than your target of $6,800, and it's better than paying $8,000 to John."
