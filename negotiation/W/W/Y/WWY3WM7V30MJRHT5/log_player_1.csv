{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,000 is far too low for me, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise.  I want to get as close to my $12,000 goal as possible."

This is a fair price that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Bob's offer:

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll counteroffer again. I'm determined to get as close to my $12,000 goal as possible."
