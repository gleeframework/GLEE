"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I have to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500.  This is a fair price that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows you to save money and still gives me a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
