"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a great opportunity for both of us, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your $1,500,000 maximum and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you the most money."
