Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it also shows him that I value the product highly.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to give up on getting a better price just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still trying to get closer to my desired price."

Bob is firm on his $1,500,000 offer, and I've already made a counteroffer. There's no more room to negotiate, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
