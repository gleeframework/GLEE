"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product is valuable, $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Alice,5,
