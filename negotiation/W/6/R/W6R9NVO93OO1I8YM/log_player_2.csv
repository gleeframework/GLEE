{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth exploring options before committing to a price.  $500,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get it for less."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm going to start with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This price is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point."

$400,000 is still a bit high.  I'm going to try to get the price down further with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get the price down closer to my initial counteroffer. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer $400,000, which is right in the middle of her last offer and my previous counteroffer.  I believe this shows good faith and could lead to a deal being reached."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is back to her original offer, which is not ideal. However, I still have time and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

I'm going to offer $425,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's. This might be my last chance to get a deal with Alice, so I want to be as close as possible to her desired price while still saving some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now asking for a higher price than her initial offer, and with only one round left, it's clear she's not going to budge further. It's not worth the risk of getting into a bidding war, especially since John's offer is guaranteed."
