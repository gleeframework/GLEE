Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage.  However, I'm aware that this is a risky strategy. If Bob rejects the offer outright, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's best to accept and move on."
