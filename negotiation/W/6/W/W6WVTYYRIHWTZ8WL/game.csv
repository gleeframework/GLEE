"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $750,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again â€“ how about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
