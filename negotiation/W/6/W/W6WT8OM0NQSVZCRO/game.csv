"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12500. It's still a great deal considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
