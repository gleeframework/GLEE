"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and what his budget might be. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, but I want to ensure I get a good return on the product, which I value at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher, and also want to keep the negotiation going to see how determined he is to buy the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while demonstrating I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's higher than John's offer, I still feel like there's room for a better deal.  I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer again, coming down slightly from my previous offer.  I want to show I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price above my minimum.  This should keep Bob engaged and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. $1,150,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
