"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down significantly on the price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to invest closer to $1,000,000, but I have to balance that with the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,075,000.

This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
