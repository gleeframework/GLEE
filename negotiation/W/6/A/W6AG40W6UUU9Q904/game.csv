"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm confident it will be worth far more than that to you in the long run.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible.",15000.0,Alice,1,
