"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would you consider lowering your price to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would allow you to secure the product at a reasonable price while giving me a fair return.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $1,300,000? This would be closer to what I am able to offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $1,325,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still unable to meet you at $1,325,000. Could you possibly lower the price to $1,300,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise given my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
