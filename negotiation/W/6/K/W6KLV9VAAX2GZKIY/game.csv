"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's quality and features. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
