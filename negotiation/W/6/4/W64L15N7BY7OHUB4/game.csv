"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product offers immense value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider a price of $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Would you consider a price of $1,300,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
