Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $120? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk losing him entirely and having to sell to John for $100."
