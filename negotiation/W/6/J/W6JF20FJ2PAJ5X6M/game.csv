"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good margin for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a reasonable profit for me.",875000.0,Alice,3,
