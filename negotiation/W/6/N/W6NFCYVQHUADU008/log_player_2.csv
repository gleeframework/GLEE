Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his limit as possible.  $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still too high. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate, and there's no reason to accept a price that is significantly higher than his desired target.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to save as much as possible.  Increasing the offer slightly to $875,000 demonstrates continued negotiation while keeping the price below $900,000, showing that Bob is serious about acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still well above Bob's desired price point.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement is high.  Bob's goal is to save money, and at this point, purchasing from John offers a guaranteed savings of $190,000 compared to Alice's current offer.  While there's a chance Alice might lower her price, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential reward."
