Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price. This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. I know Bob values the product at $100, so he'll likely counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if his offer isn't close enough to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still firmly above Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also signaling that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price. This should encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer $120, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
