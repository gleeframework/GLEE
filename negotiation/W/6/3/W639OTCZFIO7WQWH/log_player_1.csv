Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've reconsidered and am willing to increase my offer to $1,900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,900,000 is a significant profit over both my minimum and John's offer. It's always possible to get more, but there's also the risk Bob will lower his offer or walk away in later rounds."
