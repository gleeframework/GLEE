"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business. My asking price is $1000000. This represents a significant value proposition, considering the product's worth to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this price is fair and mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our potential partnership, $900000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This still leaves room for a very profitable venture for you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $925000? I think this is a fair price that still allows for a profitable venture for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
