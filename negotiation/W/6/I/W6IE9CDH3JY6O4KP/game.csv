"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to go up to $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500. How about $8,750? It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",8750.0,Alice,3,
