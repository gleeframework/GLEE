"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations and achieve your goals more efficiently. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, I understand its worth to you is $1,500,000. However, my goal is to maximize the return on this valuable asset, so I propose a price that reflects its true market potential and my commitment to achieving the highest possible value for this transaction.

I am offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This price not only ensures a substantial profit margin for me but also presents a compelling investment opportunity for you, considering the product's high value to you and the potential for significant returns on your investment.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or if there's a way I can further assist you in making a decision. I am confident that together, we can create a mutually beneficial arrangement that respects the importance of this product to both of us.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

Explanation:
While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more competitive price, potentially closer to her actual valuation. 

You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice.
