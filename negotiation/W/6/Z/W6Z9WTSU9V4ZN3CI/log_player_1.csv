Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While we have John as a backup, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It's better to try and secure a deal with Bob at a slightly lower profit than risk him rejecting the offer and relying solely on John."
