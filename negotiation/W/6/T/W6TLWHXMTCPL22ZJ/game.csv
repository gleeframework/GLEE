"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about offering the product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still give you a significant profit while ensuring I get a fair value for my product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the right price for the product. How about we aim for $975,000? This still gives you a good profit margin while being closer to my valuation.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to consider $985,000 as the price for the product. This is higher than my initial offer and closer to your last proposal. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $995,000. This is a small step towards your offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?",995000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I believe $990,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations and helps us finalize the deal.",990000.0,Bob,8,
