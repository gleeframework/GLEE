Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a compromise at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, but still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I can see that you're really interested in this, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,150,000.  While it's not the $1,000,000 ideal, it's a much better deal than John's $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point."
