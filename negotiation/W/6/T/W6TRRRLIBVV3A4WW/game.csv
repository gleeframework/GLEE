"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a compromise at $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, but still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I can see that you're really interested in this, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
