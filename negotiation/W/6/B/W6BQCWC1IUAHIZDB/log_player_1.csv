"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer that allows room for negotiation, but also sets a clear expectation of the product's value. It's important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I don't need to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's worth trying to negotiate further. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, indicating he may be willing to pay more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is a more realistic price considering Bob's initial counteroffer, but still leaves room for some negotiation. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but also emphasizes that the product is worth more than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is only $100,000 less than my last counteroffer. I'm going to accept this offer. It's important to remember that time is a factor, and I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's a good deal, and I can always try to get a higher price next time I sell something valuable."
