Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $175, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I would accept from John ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  I've included a message explaining the value of the product and justifying the price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer, but I want to see if he's interested in the product at a higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a backup:** While John is willing to pay $150, I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. It's still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Maintain value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also setting a clear limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation potential:** I've already lowered my price significantly.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John provides a guaranteed sale:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer at this point."
