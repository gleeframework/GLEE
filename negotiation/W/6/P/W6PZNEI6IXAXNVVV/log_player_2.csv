Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer,  $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which reflects the product's substantial value and leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to explore other options.
