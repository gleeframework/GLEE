"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer,  $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which reflects the product's substantial value and leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer with $1,525,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
