"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $100, I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving us a chance to settle on a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $160, which is still below my minimum but a significant step up from Bob's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and keep trying to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to sell to John for $150 when I can potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering $155, which is just above my minimum acceptable price.  This demonstrates a genuine willingness to compromise while still protecting my bottom line.  Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal and will counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and keep trying to reach a price I'm comfortable with. There are still 4 rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  If we don't, I'll be happy to sell to John for $150, but I'm not giving up on a better deal with Bob yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $150. This is a clear signal that I'm committed to closing a deal with Bob.  With only 3 rounds remaining,  I'm taking a firm stance while giving Bob one last opportunity to accept. If he doesn't, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is close to my minimum, I'm going to stick to my guns and reject this offer. There are only two rounds left and I'm hoping to see if Bob will come up to my asking price of $150. If not, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll be forced to sell to John in the final round.  I've given Bob every opportunity to negotiate, and it's now up to him to decide if he wants to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round. Since Bob has not met my minimum price of $150, I will sell the product to John for $150. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to further compromise my bottom line. This deal ensures I get my desired profit and avoids any further negotiation."
