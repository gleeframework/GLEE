"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving towards my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's the highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'll make a reasonable profit.",9000.0,Alice,5,
