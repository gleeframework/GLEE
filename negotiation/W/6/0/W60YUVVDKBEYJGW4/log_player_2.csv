{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. There's a chance she might be willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still potentially within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if necessary.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both of us can benefit."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though she's lowered it.  I'll continue to negotiate, as there's still potential to get a better price. I'll aim for a price closer to my budget of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  $900,000 is still within my budget and closer to her last offer, increasing the likelihood of her accepting."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation. It's likely Alice is also motivated to sell and might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about buying the product and accept my offer.  If she rejects, I'll buy the product from John at the same price, avoiding any further negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget, and I've already made my final offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  To avoid further delay and ensure I get the product, I'll buy from John at my maximum budget."
