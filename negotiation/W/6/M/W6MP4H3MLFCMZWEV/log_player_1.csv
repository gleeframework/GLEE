Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a highly profitable investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than a purchase.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the offer can make Bob more inclined to consider it seriously.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. You can always negotiate down if Bob rejects it, but starting high gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
