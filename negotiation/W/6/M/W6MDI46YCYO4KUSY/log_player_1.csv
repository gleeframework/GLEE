Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob, allowing me to gauge his willingness to pay.
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware of John's standing $100 offer, which serves as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to secure a better deal. By rejecting and countering, I can try to push the price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've come down from my initial offer ($115) to signal a willingness to negotiate.
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** $110 represents a split of the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, aiming for a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still ensures a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about $108? That's a pretty good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While I could counter again, Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments ($3, now $2). It's becoming less likely he'll agree to a price significantly closer to $110. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** $108 still provides a reasonable profit margin above my minimum of $100.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting his offer now secures a satisfactory deal."
