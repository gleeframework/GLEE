"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the generous starting point. However, I'm looking to get the best possible deal, and $11,000 is a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $10,875 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to your last offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250, but this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.
