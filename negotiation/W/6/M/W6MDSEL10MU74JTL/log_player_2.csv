"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique opportunity,  $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 1300000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still willing to negotiate further and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,300,000. However, I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 1100000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for 1200000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, and John is willing to sell it for that price. It's not worth it to continue negotiating with Alice when I can get the product at my target price from John."
