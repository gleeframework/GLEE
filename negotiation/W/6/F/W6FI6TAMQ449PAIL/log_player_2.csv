"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000). I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider paying $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is still well below the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). While I could potentially counteroffer again, the risk of Alice rejecting and me having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few more dollars.  It's a good compromise and I can secure the product without breaking my budget."
