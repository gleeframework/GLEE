"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $122.50. Can you consider that?",122.5,Bob,4,
