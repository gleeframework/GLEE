# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than Alice's initial offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money.  While buying from John is an option, it's not the most cost-effective choice at this point."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original price point to make this work.  How about $900,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable return on the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still able to get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to his desired price, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially save more money. Buying from John is still not the best option at this point."
