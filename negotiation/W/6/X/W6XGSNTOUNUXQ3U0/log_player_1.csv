Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **The message** is friendly and sets a positive tone, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob.  It leaves the door open for negotiation without being overly aggressive.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high, but not unreasonably so. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also encouraging Bob to engage in negotiations. I'll be prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but ultimately I have the option to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point and my starting offer.  I'm not ready to sell at that price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise within a reasonable range. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original price point to make this work.  How about $900,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable return on the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a compromise that is closer to my initial offer of $950,000 while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **The message** is still positive and constructive, showing willingness to negotiate while holding firm on my value for the product.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while demonstrating that I won't accept a price too far below my original offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll reassess and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay close to your original price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, giving you a good return and me a significant saving. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$875,000** is a very good price. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it's closer to my desired price point. 
* **Bob's message** indicates a strong desire to make a deal, and the price is now within a reasonable range for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that the price could drop further, or that negotiations could stall completely.  Selling to John for $800,000 would be a less profitable outcome.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good profit and move on."
