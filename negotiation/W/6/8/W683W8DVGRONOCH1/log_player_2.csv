{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, it's likely Bob can get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to budge on her initial price. He's offering $7,000, which is $500 less than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates his serious intent to negotiate and his willingness to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob is still determined to try and get a better price. He has 7 rounds left, so there's still time to see if he can push for a lower price.  By rejecting, he keeps the negotiation moving towards his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's being more subtle. He's only offering $100 less than Alice's last offer. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best deal. By offering a smaller amount, he hopes to avoid Alice rejecting the offer outright and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a reasonable price, saving Bob $650 compared to buying from John.  With 5 rounds remaining, he's still in a good position if he needs to negotiate with other sellers later."
