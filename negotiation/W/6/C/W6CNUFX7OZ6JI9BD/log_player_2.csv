"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  This offer still leaves room for negotiation, and is below Bob's maximum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point, but it's closer to his maximum price point.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise but also that he believes there is still room for Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price point, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better price, but it's also risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and each round of negotiation takes time.  Buying from John guarantees that Bob will get the product within his budget, even though it's not the best possible price.  

At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of a stalemate or a prolonged process."
