"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Being open to negotiation:**  This phrase signals that I'm willing to work with Bob, making him feel more comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm hoping to start a dialogue with Bob, encouraging him to respond with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low, even below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a huge loss. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to a more acceptable price. While I could sell to John now for $15,000, I'd like to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, which gives me time to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $18,000 was a bit high. However, $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I'm recognizing that my initial price was too high and that Bob is offering a significantly lower price. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own needs.
* **Frame it as a fair price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Encourage further discussion:**  I'm reiterating that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still working with a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford at the moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.  This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, which is enough time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10,000 isn't quite enough for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to your price point. This would allow me to cover my costs while still leaving room for some profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging constraints:** I'm demonstrating empathy and understanding of Bob's budget limitations.
* **Offering a compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's a compromise between our previous offers. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying above my minimum value.
* **Highlighting the discount:** I'm emphasizing the reduction from my previous offer to make the counteroffer seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Focusing on a solution:** I'm framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget of $10,000. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer and is very close to my minimum value.  It's also a good outcome for Bob, as he gets the product for a price that works for him. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and close the deal.  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance that I won't be able to reach a better price and may end up selling to John for $15,000, which would be a worse outcome for me."
