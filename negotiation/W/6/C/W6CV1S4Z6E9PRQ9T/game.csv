"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd like to start with an offer of $9500. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for the unique features and benefits it offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, so how about we settle at $10500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of a price of $11500. This is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to prioritize getting the best possible price for this item.",11500.0,Alice,5,
