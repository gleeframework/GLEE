"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,250. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is closer to our middle ground. This is my final offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $11,000, which is the same price I initially offered, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is now offering extras, the price remains at $11,000. Bob has already rejected this price twice, and is unlikely to accept it now. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price.  While there is a risk of not reaching a deal with Alice,  Bob still has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still looking for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $10,875 for the product.  This is my final offer, let me know if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can do $11,250, but I'll also throw in a warranty and some additional support to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in round 7, and Alice has repeatedly rejected Bob's offers. It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price that's acceptable to Bob.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing. 

Given the limited rounds and the fact that John is offering a price within Bob's budget, it's strategically sound to buy from John. This guarantees Bob will get the product within the allotted rounds and prevents further negotiation fatigue."
