Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while knowing you have a secure backup option with John."
