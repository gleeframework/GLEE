"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price. What do you say to a deal at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
