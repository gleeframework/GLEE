"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While $850,000 is still a bit steep for me, I can see we're both willing to negotiate. How about $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about making this deal work."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, or buying from John at the same price.  Accepting Alice's offer closes the deal at the best possible price for you."
