"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a common strategy to maximize profit.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Optimistic Tone:** Maintaining an optimistic tone sets a positive foundation for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $800,000. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to consider my options, as I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  $900,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price point, and closer to John's offer than my ideal.
* **Negotiation Space:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.  
* **Strategic Considerations:** I'm not yet desperate to sell, so I can afford to be selective and maintain a stronger negotiating position. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but leaving room for some flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still represent a great value for you and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm lowering my price but not drastically, signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob but also maintaining my value expectations. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and framing the deal as mutually beneficial.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise and suggests willingness to continue negotiations.

**Important Note:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **Negotiation room:**  I still have several rounds left and there's room to negotiate further.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can still get a price closer to my initial offer or even closer to Bob's true value of $1,500,000.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $950,000, aiming to find a compromise in the middle. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup, especially if we approach the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly below the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This would represent a fair compromise, allowing you a great deal while ensuring I receive a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  It signals a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Fair Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value to Bob, but now I'm framing it as a ""fair"" compromise to make it more appealing.
* **Momentum:** This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm not willing to go lower drastically, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Important Note:**  I'm still aware of John's offer. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to carefully weigh the remaining rounds and the potential for a better deal with Bob versus the certainty of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $980,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is inching closer to my minimum, $980,000 is still significantly below my desired price. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1 million.
* **Negotiation room:**  I have four rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm still hopeful to get a price closer to my initial offer or even closer to Bob's true value of $1,500,000. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $980,000, aiming to find a compromise in the middle. However, I'll be more cautious as the number of rounds decreases. If we get to the final rounds, I will need to seriously consider John's offer as a backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet at $995,000?  This is a slight increase from your offer but a significant step closer to my initial position.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both of us."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm still flexible but not willing to budge too much.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  We're getting closer to the final rounds, so I'm emphasizing that we need to reach an agreement soon.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider John's offer more seriously.  With only three rounds left, I need to ensure I can secure a reasonable price or be prepared to accept John's offer."
