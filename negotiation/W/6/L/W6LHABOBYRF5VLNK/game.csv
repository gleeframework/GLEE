"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go below $1100000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and meet at $950000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
