"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
