I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000. Taking the sure thing saves you $50,000."
