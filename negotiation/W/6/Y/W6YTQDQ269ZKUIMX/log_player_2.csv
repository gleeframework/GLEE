"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $100 is still cheaper than buying from John for $120. 
* Although you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the question doesn't provide any mechanism for doing so. 
* The goal is to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
