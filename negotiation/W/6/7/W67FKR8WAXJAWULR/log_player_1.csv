{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent margin while hopefully still being appealing enough for Bob to consider.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to get the sale done quickly,  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but shows some flexibility and willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this is closer to Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and selling to John would only give me $12,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
