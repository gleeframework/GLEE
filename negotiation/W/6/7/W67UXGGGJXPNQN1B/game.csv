"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
