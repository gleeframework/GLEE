{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $16000, which is the highest I can go without losing too much. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $16,000, which is closer to Bob's budget. However, Bob should still reject the offer and continue to negotiate. He's still within his budget to reject the offer and buy from John, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $15,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
