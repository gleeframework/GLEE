"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good starting point, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:**  A $2,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to buy but also his desire for a good deal.
* **Clear and concise message:** The message is friendly but firm, explaining Bob's perspective and the counteroffer clearly. 
* **Focus on the deal:** The message focuses on the product's value and the price, avoiding unnecessary chit-chat."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a competitive price, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This offer still reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $12,000.
* **Saving money:**  This deal allows Bob to save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Time consideration:**  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers or the negotiation dragging on is significant. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product without risking a higher price from John."
