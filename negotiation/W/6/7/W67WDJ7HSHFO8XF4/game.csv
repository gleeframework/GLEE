"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $7,750 is closer, but I still need to make a profit.  How about $8,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,000.  That's a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
