Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,050,000 is still too low, but I want to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering both our interests. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,075,000 is closer to my goal, I still have room to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a price that's more favorable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your firm stance.  However, $1,075,000 simply isn't enough for me to part with this product. Let's make a final compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,090,000. This is a small step from my last offer, and a big step for me. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,090,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the $1,080,000 now than risk getting nothing from Bob and having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
