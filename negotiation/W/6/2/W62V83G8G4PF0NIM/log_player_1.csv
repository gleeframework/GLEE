{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for my minimum price, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting that other buyers are interested creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** I'm aiming high initially. If Bob rejects this offer, I have room to negotiate down closer to his $800,000 valuation while still ensuring a profit."
