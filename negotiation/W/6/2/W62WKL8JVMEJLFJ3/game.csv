"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you counteroffer. I'm motivated to sell, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
