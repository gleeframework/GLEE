"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product we both recognize as incredibly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you counteroffer. I'm motivated to sell, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or the need to purchase from John.  At this point,  the potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk."
