"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50?  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $88.50.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",88.5,Alice,7,
