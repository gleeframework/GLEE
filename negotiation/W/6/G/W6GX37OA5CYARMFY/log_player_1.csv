"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm optimistic that Bob will be interested in the product and will accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to my desired price.  $92.50 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values it at $80, and it's closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle and sell it to me for $91? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $91 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we settle on $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm sticking to my strategy of meeting Bob halfway, but I'm pushing for a price that's closer to my desired price. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me at $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to a deal, $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  I have John as a backup option, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $88.50.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.5} 
```

I'm continuing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm trying to push the price up just a bit more.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are now in round 8 and Bob's offer of $86 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're getting nowhere. I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident that we'll be able to reach an agreement that works for me. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
