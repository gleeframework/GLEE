Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're keen on making this deal work. However, $850,000 is unfortunately not in my range.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This price still allows for some profit for me while also reflecting your budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue exploring ways to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is close to Bob's maximum budget.  It's a good deal for both parties, as Alice is getting a price above her minimum, and Bob is getting a price below his maximum.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy in this situation."
