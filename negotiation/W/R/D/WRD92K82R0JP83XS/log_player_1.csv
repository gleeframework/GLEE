Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident it's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the product's value and my willingness to compromise. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving the door open:** By saying ""Let me know what you think,"" I invite Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit on your end.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I believe there's room for both of us to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're keen on making this deal work. However, $850,000 is unfortunately not in my range.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This price still allows for some profit for me while also reflecting your budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price still allows me some profit while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Call for action:** I end with a clear call to action, urging Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it and allows for some profit on both sides. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a bit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm determined to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to engage with Bob in the next round to explore a compromise that benefits both of us."
