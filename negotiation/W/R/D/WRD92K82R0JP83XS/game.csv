"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident it's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit on your end.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're keen on making this deal work. However, $850,000 is unfortunately not in my range.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, recognizing the value you see in this product.  This price still allows for some profit for me while also reflecting your budget. Let's close this deal and make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it and allows for some profit on both sides. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a bit.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue exploring ways to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
