"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm on a tight budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.
