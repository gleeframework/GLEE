Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's something you'd really value.  I'm asking for $175 for it."",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $175, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can always come down in price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $150, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines."
