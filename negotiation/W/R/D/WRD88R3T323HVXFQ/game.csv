"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $1,200,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
