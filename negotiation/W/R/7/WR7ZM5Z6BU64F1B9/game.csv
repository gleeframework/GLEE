"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $8000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $8500? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I'm still not quite comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet at $7500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $8250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $7000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. If not, I may need to consider buying from John for $12000.",7000.0,Bob,6,
