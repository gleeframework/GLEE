Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is way out of my budget. I'm looking for something closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $18,000 is closer to a realistic price point, it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a solution here.  $10,000 is still quite low considering what this product offers, but I'm willing to move a bit further. How about we make it $16,000, my final offer?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While $16,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are too small. At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than $12,000. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
