"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you and it's closer to my minimum value. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
