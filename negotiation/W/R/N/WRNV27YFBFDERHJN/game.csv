Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850000. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
