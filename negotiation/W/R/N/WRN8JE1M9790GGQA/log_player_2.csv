{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is only worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $120.  There's no reason to accept the offer at this stage. Bob has more negotiating power and should try to get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $95.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still above Bob's target price of $100.  There are only three rounds left and Bob has a guaranteed way to get the product from John for his target price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down to Bob's price in the next round."
