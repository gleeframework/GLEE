"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $70 for it.  What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,100.0
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $90, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,,
