Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the $14,000 offer, you still have the option to negotiate down towards his $12,000 valuation, knowing you have a safety net with John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
