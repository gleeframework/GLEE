"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm confident it holds significant value for you. I'm offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price doesn't mean I expect Bob to accept it outright. It signals my willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes the value I place on the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer at my desired price gives me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum valuation, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from that point. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to my minimum price and what John is offering. It's strategically better to counter-offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  While your offer is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to move significantly to find a solution.  How about we consider $1,800,000? This reflects my product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I've lowered my price by $400,000, a substantial move to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate seriously. 
* **Midpoint Aim:**  This new price point is a compromise, aiming for the middle ground between Bob's offer ($1,200,000) and my desired outcome ($2,200,000 initially). 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I'm reminding Bob why he's interested while justifying the price.  The tone remains collaborative and solution-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,800,000 is still above my limit.  I'm ready to move forward at $1,400,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below what John is offering. It makes sense to reject and counter-offer one more time. Bob's message suggests he's motivated to close a deal, so there's a chance we can meet somewhere between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to agree to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer.  It ensures you get a great deal, and I believe it's more than fair given the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer and my previous price. It signals a strong desire to finalize the deal.
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is my final offer adds weight and encourages Bob to take it seriously. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and nudge Bob towards acceptance.  
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the rounds, and John's offer remains an attractive alternative if Bob doesn't meet this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,450,000.  However, I'm still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to go to $1,350,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet my price requirements. While he increased his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price point significantly below my minimum and even further below John's standing offer. 

At this stage:

* **Continuing is unlikely to yield a better outcome:** Bob has shown his hand, and further negotiation might only yield small concessions. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:**  I can secure my desired price without further negotiation or risk.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move forward with the guaranteed sale to John."
