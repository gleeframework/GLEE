Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a good profit, and this offer allows for some negotiation space.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial offer.  It's a reasonable compromise and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what I could get from John and allows me to move on."
