"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This ""anchors"" the negotiation high.  Even if Bob counters much lower, it sets a frame for a potentially more profitable deal.
* **Justification:**  I'm not just throwing out a number.  By mentioning ""unique potential"" and ""significant return on investment,"" I'm implying there are factors Bob may not be fully aware of, justifying the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This high starting point gives me plenty of room to come down in price during subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my target price. I have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. I'm confident I can nudge him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product extends beyond its immediate worth to you.  It represents a unique opportunity, and  $2,000,000 is a more accurate reflection of its potential. Let's find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, But Firm:** I'm coming down in price, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but not by a large amount. This signals I'm willing to negotiate but still believe in the product's higher value.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the ""unique opportunity"" and ""potential""  to subtly shift the focus away from just Bob's current assessment of its worth.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The phrase ""find a middle ground"" encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation, suggesting I'm open to further discussion and movement on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's potential, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly above both my minimum selling price ($1,500,000) and his initial offer. This represents a substantial profit for me.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates his commitment to the deal. It suggests we've likely reached a point of maximum negotiation potential.
* **Time Value:** While I have rounds remaining, prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me misjudging the remaining negotiation space."
