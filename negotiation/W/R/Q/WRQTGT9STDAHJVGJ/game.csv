"Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product looks great, but  $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. While I do like the product, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $9,500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and puts us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,000? That's a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll get a lot of value from this product. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
