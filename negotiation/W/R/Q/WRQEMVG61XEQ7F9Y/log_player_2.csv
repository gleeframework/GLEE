"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find fascinating. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. While the product sounds intriguing, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal but am also willing to walk away if necessary.  This should give her some room to negotiate while still keeping me within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to counter again, hoping to close the gap further. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground.  I've increased my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  This should hopefully convince Alice to come down a bit more, bringing us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to give up much more. I'm now offering the product to you for $875000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price and is now offering a price that's within my budget. It's only $25,000 higher than my last offer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
