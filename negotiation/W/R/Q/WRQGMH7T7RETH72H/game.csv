"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target.
