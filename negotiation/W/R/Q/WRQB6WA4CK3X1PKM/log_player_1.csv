I'm offering Bob the product for $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that to me. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000. This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's initial offer."
