"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum price of $80. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $90. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. I'm trying to find a middle ground that allows us both to get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for a price that works for both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89} 
```

I'm going to lower my price one more time to $89.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of this product and finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $88. While I would prefer to sell for more, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $88 is a good price that's significantly higher than what I would get from John."
