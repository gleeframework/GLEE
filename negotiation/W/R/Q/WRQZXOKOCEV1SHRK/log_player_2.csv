Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference: $762,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm ready to close this deal today.

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly lower than her current offer.  At this point, John's offer of $800,000 is a better deal and saves you the hassle of further negotiation."
