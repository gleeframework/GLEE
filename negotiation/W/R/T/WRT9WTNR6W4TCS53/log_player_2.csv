"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $14,000 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer. It's worth trying to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback:** If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed option with John, so there's no rush to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. $11,000 is still well within your budget and leaves room for compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Alice subtly pressures her to accept a lower price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Ending with a question keeps the conversation open and encourages Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a compromise, $12,500 is still above the product's value to Alice and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  You have 7 rounds remaining to potentially secure a price closer to your target.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  It's risky to accept without exploring further negotiation, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This price would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:**  A $500 increase shows you're serious about closing the deal while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  Emphasizing ""good deal for both of us"" subtly reminds Alice of her lower value for the product.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Leaving the door open for further discussion keeps the pressure on Alice to find a solution."
