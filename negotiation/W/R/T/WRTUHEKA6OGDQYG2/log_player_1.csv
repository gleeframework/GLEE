Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower than my minimum, there's room for negotiation. Starting high allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and my willingness to offer a deal before going public, potentially justifying the high initial price in Bob's mind.
* **Fallback Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
