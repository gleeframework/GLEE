"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
