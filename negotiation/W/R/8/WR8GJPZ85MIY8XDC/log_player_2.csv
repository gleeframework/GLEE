"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'll sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than the product's worth to Alice, you know you can get it for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your backup plan."
