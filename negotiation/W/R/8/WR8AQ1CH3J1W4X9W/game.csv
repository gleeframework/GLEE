"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you say?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $115 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
