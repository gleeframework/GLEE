Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, potentially allowing you to get closer to the $12,000 value Bob places on the product.  It also avoids immediately pushing him away with an overly aggressive price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still less than the $10,000 you initially offered. This leaves room for further negotiation to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. It keeps the conversation going and may lead to a successful deal closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to the price you were hoping to achieve. While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation process."
