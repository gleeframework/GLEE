Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and using positive language to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. 
* **The Backup Plan:** The threat of selling to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage and ensures I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Leverage:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the ""discount"" Bob would be getting, emphasizing the value of the product to him.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":**  This phrase suggests a willingness to compromise, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product and willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I can use the threat of selling to John to push for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $700,000 is still not within my range.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering again, moving closer to Bob's offer, but staying above my minimum price. This shows continued negotiation while maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on ""Fairness"":**  Using the phrase ""fair price"" for both of us emphasizes that this is a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of urgency with ""Let's close this deal,"" suggesting that I'm reaching the end of my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer.  The threat of selling to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage to push for a better offer."
