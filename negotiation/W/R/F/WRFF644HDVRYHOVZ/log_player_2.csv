You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant discount for you.  Let's meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $700,000 is still not within my range.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  She seems to be stuck at a price point that is not beneficial to you. John's offer of $800,000 is a much better deal and ensures you stay within your budget."
