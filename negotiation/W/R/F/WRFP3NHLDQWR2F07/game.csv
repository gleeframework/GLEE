"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a price. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work for me. This is a fair price considering the product's true value, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
