{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit. I'm also highlighting the product's value to me, which could potentially influence Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a price. However, considering my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work for me. This is a fair price considering the product's true value, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to agree on a lower price, I believe $1,100,000 is the maximum I can offer without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still too low for me. While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident I can get a better price from John. He's willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that guaranteed profit."
