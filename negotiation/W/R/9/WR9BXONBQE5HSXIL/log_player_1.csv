{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a price above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Provides a reason for the price:** Mentioning the value of the product gives Bob something to consider.
* **Keeps the tone positive and open to discussion:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worthwhile to try and get a little more. 

You can use this opportunity to potentially increase the price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:**  It finds a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Provides a reason:** It emphasizes that this price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintains a positive tone:** It keeps the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good deal for you. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, and it's closer to your desired price than John's offer. It's a fair compromise and likely the best you can get. Accepting the offer means you won't have to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
