"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is a bit high. It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone is important in negotiations. We want Alice to be receptive to our counteroffers.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $80 without going too low too quickly. This gives us bargaining power while still potentially securing a price well below John's $120 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $92.50 would be a win, but we might be able to secure an even better deal by countering again. We're still significantly below our maximum budget of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're acknowledging Alice's desire to be closer to her original price while still nudging the negotiation in our favor.
* **Round Number Psychology:** Offering a clean $90 might feel more appealing and agreeable to Alice. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're showing Alice that we're serious about buying the product but are willing to walk away if we can't reach a mutually beneficial price."
