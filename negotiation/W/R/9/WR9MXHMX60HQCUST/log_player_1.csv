Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,400,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to move on to John who's offering a guaranteed $1,500,000."
