"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
