I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum price. This strategy allows me to potentially maximize my profit while ensuring I receive at least my minimum acceptable value for the product."
