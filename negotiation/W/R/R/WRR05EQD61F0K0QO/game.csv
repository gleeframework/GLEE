"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and potential. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $500,000 would be reasonable. What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $975,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, which I believe is a fair price. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  $650,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one final offer at $850,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a good product, but I have a strict budget. I'm willing to pay $725,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If this works for you, we have a deal.",725000.0,Bob,6,
