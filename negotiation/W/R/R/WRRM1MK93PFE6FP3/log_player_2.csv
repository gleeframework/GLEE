"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but her offer is $110, which is still too expensive. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup option.**  While John is more expensive, he's a safety net if negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer of $95 is a significant drop from Alice's $110, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value gap:**  There's a $15 difference between my offer and Alice's desired price of $80. This gap should give us both a chance to find a compromise.
* **Strategic move:** By offering a lower price, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, and I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a reduction from her previous offer, $105 is still above my target price range.
* **Room for negotiation.** I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting her offer and continuing to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:** John is a safety net if negotiations with Alice fall apart.  

I will likely counteroffer with a price slightly higher than my previous offer but lower than Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $100 represents a compromise between my previous offer of $95 and Alice's current offer of $105.  
* **Value gap closing:** This move further narrows the gap between our desired prices, making a deal more likely.
* **Strategic positioning:** By offering a slightly higher price, I show Alice that I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal. This can potentially lead to a faster agreement."
