"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000. This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to reduce my price to $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair deal. Let's see if we can close the gap.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $815,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",815000.0,Alice,7,
