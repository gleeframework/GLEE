"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are trying to save money. $90 is still too high, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$85 is still too expensive for you. You are trying to get the product for as low as possible.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $80. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're very close to your target price of $80. It's worth accepting the offer as further negotiation might lead to you buying from John at $120, which is significantly more than your target price."
