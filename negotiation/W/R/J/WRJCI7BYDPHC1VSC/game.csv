"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,5,
