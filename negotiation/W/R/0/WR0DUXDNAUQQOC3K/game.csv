"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm definitely interested. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1000000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
