```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is better than John's offer of $1,500,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still better than John's offer of $1,500,000.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate."
