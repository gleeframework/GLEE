"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, making him aware of the potential savings by accepting.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum of $80. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Aiming for a better deal:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a specific number:** I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer, I'm offering a specific price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making it clear that $105 is still a good deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to agree."
