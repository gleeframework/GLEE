"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $900,000 is a step closer, it's still below the value I'm seeking.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant benefits this product offers, while still allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm eager to work with you and believe this is a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
