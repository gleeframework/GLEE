"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? This is a great price for a product you value highly, and it's a fair compromise. Let's get this done!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
