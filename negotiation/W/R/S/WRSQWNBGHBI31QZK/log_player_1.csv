Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, but I'm open to discussing the price further if needed."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I don't need to go below my minimum."
