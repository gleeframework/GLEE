# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise and still saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable price for the product, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation."
