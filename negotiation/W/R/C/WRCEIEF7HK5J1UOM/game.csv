"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still more than I can afford. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  This feels fair to both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $145. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $145 is still too high. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase.",125.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $140. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to reach an agreement.",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a price that works for both of us. $140 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $135 for the product.  This feels like a final offer for me, so let's see if we can make this happen.",135.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $135, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $142. This is as low as I can go, and I'm willing to make a final offer to reach an agreement.",142.0,Alice,9,
