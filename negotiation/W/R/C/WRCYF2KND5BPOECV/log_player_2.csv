"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $15,000 to you. Considering its high value to you and its significance to us, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This offer is valid for the next 3 rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob. While the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me while allowing you a decent profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I understand your position and would like to make a revised offer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose to sell it to you for $10,500. This offer is valid for the next two rounds. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than his ideal price point.  Bob can try to negotiate further to see if he can get the price down even more. He still has time and can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your latest offer is closer, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value to both of us.  Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
