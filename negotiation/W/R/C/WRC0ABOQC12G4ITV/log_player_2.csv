(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though Alice is getting a better deal than you, it's still a good deal for you as you are buying the product for less than your maximum budget."
