"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $750,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm proposing a price of $825,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
