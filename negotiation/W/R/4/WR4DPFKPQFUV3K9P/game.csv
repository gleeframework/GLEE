"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,000? This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",14000.0,Alice,5,
