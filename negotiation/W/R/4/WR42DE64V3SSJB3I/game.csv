"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50?  This gives you a good price, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any room for flexibility on your end?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this. ",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",87.0,Bob,6,
