Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $120 to me, so I cannot accept Bob's offer of $85. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50?  This gives you a good price, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any room for flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum price of $120. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not quite there yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this. "", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether. I'll sell the product to John for $120."
