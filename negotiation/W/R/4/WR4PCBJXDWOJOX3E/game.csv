"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, and I need to stay within my budget. How about we start at $8,000?  I think that's a fair opening considering the price difference we need to bridge.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $14,000? It's a compromise that still benefits me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need you to meet me closer to my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to increase your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work with you, but also reflects the product's true value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
