I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me, and I need to stay within my budget. How about we start at $8,000?  I think that's a fair opening considering the price difference we need to bridge. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
