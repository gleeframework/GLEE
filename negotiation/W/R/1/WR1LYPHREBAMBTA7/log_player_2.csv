Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $1,225,000 for the product. It's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
