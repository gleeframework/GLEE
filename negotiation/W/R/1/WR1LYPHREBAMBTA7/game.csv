"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $1,225,000 for the product. It's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
