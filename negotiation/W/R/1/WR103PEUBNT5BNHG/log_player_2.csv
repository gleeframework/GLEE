"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice is offering a price that is significantly below your maximum, you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give us some room to negotiate. I believe a price of $750,000 is a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is moving closer to my target price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $800,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still looking for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price and within my budget. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
