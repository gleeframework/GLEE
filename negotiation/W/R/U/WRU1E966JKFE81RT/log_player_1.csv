Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes profit:**  If Bob accepts, I make an extra $1,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to pay more, so there's potential to earn even more.
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm aiming for a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring I don't miss out on a sale by setting the price too high."
