"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and leaves room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and leaves some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If this price doesn't work for you, I'm prepared to buy from John for the same price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
