"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is way over Bob's budget and he can get the product for $100 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it for 100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for 140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his $100 limit. He can still get the product for less from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, so let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to 115. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $130 is better than her previous offers, it's still above his self-imposed $100 limit.  There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it for 120. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for 125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, it's still above his $100 limit. There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his goal. It's possible Alice might be willing to go even lower, especially as she's already made several concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $118.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for 118. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for 122. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $100. He has reached his limit in terms of price and Alice is not willing to go lower than $122, which is still above his target price.  There is only one round left, so it is unlikely that Alice will change her mind. Buying from John will allow him to acquire the product for the best possible price within his budget."
