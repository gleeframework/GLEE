Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price, but I can't raise it once it's been lowered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping the price higher than my minimum acceptable value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially lowering the price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit."
