"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny of the $8,000 we're asking for. This exceptional offer is exclusive to you and represents an unparalleled opportunity to own something truly special. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information about the product. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own perceived value of $8,000. There's no discount offered.  Since you know John is willing to sell the product for the same price, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer in the hopes of getting a better deal. You can always go back to John if Alice doesn't budge."
