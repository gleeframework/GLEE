Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!"", ""product_price"": 120}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
