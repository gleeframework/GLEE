# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, which is much higher. I know this is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget."
