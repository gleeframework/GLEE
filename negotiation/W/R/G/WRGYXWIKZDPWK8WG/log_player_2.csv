Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. How about $11,300? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 11300
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counter-offer shows Alice that we're serious about the purchase but also holds a firm line on our budget. 
* **""Final offer"" tactic:** By stating this is our final offer, we're adding a bit of pressure for Alice to accept. It might encourage her to take it rather than risk losing the sale.
* **Still below John's price:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, we're still in a good position to buy from John at $12,000."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:**  Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a $500 saving from John's price. 
* **Final offer:**  She's indicated this is her final offer, so pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Time constraint:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk having to accept John's price later."
