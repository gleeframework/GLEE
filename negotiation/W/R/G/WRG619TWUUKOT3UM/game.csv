"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $160. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $130. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm going to need at least $140 to make this worthwhile for me. If you're not willing to go higher, I may have to consider other options.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $135 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I need a little bit more to make this work. How about $138? This is my final offer.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $136.50. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on.",136.5,Bob,8,
