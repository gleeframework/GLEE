"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if you agree.",9750.0,Bob,4,
