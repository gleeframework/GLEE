{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a highly beneficial acquisition for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net of $800,000, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit. 
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning there's a potential $100,000 surplus we can tap into.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 leaves Bob with a significant saving compared to his perceived value, making the offer attractive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price provides room for potential negotiation if Bob counters, while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price."
