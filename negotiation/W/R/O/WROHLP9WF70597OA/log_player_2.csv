"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still determined to save as much as possible. I'll counteroffer again and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
