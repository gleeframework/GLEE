"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
