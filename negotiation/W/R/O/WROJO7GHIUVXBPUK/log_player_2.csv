"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you can potentially save $100,000 by negotiating further. There's no harm in trying to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than what John is offering.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, it's likely that the price won't go much lower.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you the effort of further negotiation and is a good deal overall."
