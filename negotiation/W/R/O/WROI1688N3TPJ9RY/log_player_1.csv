Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation of the product but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for that price if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is closer to my minimum value of $150, I am not willing to settle for that amount just yet. I believe I can get a higher price if I counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112.50 is still below my minimum of $150, it's very close to my previous counteroffer and accepting means a quick sale. Given the potential for continued negotiations and the risk of Bob walking away, it's best to take the deal now."
