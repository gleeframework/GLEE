Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I think I can do $98. Let's see if we can meet in the final stretch. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","It seems like Alice is getting stuck on a higher price. It's time to raise the stakes and consider our alternative. 

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $120 is higher than we hoped, it's becoming increasingly unlikely Alice will go much lower than $98.  Cutting our losses and securing the product from John guarantees we stay within our budget."
