Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By framing it as a pre-public offer, I'm subtly suggesting a sense of exclusivity and potential advantage for Bob to act quickly."
