"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle around $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but $1,250,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to finalize the deal at $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
