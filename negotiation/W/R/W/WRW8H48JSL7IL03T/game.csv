"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value. I believe it could be highly beneficial to your business.  My asking price is $1500000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1200000 is closer to my target,  it's still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1250000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
