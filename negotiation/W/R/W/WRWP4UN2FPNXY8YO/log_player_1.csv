Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Option to walk away:** I'm reminding Bob that I have a backup buyer, which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Leverage John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, giving me the ability to hold out for a better price from Bob.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its unique value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with my other buyer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final offer:** I'm establishing that this is my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reminder of other buyer:**  I'm reinforcing the fact that I have a backup option, adding pressure to Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **John's offer is better:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's final offer, and it's guaranteed.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John is the most advantageous choice at this point, as it guarantees a higher price and eliminates further negotiation with Bob."
