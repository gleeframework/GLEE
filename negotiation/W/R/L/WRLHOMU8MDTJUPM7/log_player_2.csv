"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, there's significant room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you time to haggle and try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You want to save as much money as possible, so John's price is only an option if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly above your value for the product. I'm open to discussing further but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** It's closer to your maximum, but there's still room for negotiation.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which still leaves you with a significant profit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still too high.** While you have 5 rounds left, you need to be cautious about potentially getting stuck with a price that's too close to your maximum.
* **You want to save as much as possible.** There's still room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You can continue to work with Alice to try and get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident we can make this work if you're willing to be reasonable."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. My value for the product is $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 6-month warranty. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting very close to your target.** You're only $50,000 away from your desired price of $1,000,000.
* **The added extras are valuable.** The maintenance package and warranty could save you money in the long run.
* **You only have 3 rounds left.**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting now is the most pragmatic choice, as you're close to your desired price and you have a chance to get some extras.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You're getting a significantly better price from Alice, even with the extras."
