"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $8,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm confident the product has value, but I'd like to start with a lower offer of $7,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
