"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $110.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105? This gives us both a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $97.50 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $101.25? This is a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think we can meet in the middle from there.",95.0,Bob,6,
