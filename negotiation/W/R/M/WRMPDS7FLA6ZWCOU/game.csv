"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
