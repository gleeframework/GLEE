"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,050,000.

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me to move forward.  How about $1,000,000?
