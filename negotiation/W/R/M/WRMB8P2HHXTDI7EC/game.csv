"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget might be a little lower, but $80 is quite a bit less than what I'm looking for. Would you consider meeting in the middle somewhere around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we try $95? That's a significant move on my end.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate which I appreciate.  While $95 is closer, I can't let it go for less than $125.  This product is worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll agree once you have it.",125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget.  My final offer is $100.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
