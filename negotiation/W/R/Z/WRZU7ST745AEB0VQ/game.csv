"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,250. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product to you and the original price I was willing to accept.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  While $8,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm offering the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
