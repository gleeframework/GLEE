"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and  $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the long-term benefits it will provide.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,4,
