Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and  $900,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the long-term benefits it will provide."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to our minimum, his latest offer is still significantly below our walk-away price. It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price, and avoids the risk of Bob not reaching our price point."
