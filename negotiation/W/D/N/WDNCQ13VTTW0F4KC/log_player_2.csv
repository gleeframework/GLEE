"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, which is good.  I think there's still room to negotiate before going up to $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and while I could try to negotiate further, $820,000 is a reasonable deal. It's better to secure the product at a good price now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to go with John at full price."
