"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  It's not worth accepting this offer.  Rejecting and negotiating is a better strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to establish a starting point for negotiation. We know Alice values the product at $150, so there's room for compromise. This offer is a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $160 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best course of action at this point.  I can potentially get a lower price, or if the negotiation stalls, I can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm trying to meet her halfway.  This offer is still below my maximum budget and leaves room for a potential compromise. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I can still buy from John for $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, $155 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get a lower price and stay within my budget. If the negotiation stalls, I still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making my final offer at my maximum budget.  This offer is a strong signal to Alice that I am serious about buying the product, but am not willing to go any higher. If Alice accepts this offer, we both get a good deal. If she rejects it, I can move on to John and still get the product within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is still above my maximum budget of $120. Even though I've been negotiating, it seems like Alice is not willing to come down further.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. It's more beneficial to move on to John, who is offering the product at my desired price."
