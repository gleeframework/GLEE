"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the market value and the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits and returns you'll get from owning this product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1,087,500. I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
