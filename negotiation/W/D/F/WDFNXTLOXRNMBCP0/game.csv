"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, reflecting its quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I can go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down further to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can find common ground here.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000, which is my final offer.  This represents a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. While $1,350,000 is still slightly below my target, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
