{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, reflecting its quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my floor price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I have 9 rounds left, so I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I can go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable with selling the product for $1,300,000. I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob or sell it to John for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down further to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can find common ground here.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000, which is my final offer.  This represents a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have 4 rounds left and I'm hoping to get a higher offer. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is more appealing at this point."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. While $1,350,000 is still slightly below my target, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
