"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, reflecting its quality and potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth accepting this offer at this stage. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's a reduction from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to reach a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I can go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down further to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can find common ground here.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above the $1,000,000 threshold that Bob is comfortable with.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a price closer to his maximum.  At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is a viable option, but it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,350,000, which is my final offer.  This represents a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. While $1,350,000 is still slightly below my target, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price is slim.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and secure a deal within his budget."
