"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's worth to me, I can offer you $9,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $10,000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it aligns with the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll offer you $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
