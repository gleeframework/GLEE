"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting high, at $900,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little extra to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$700,000 is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$750,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer.  It's important for me to try to reach a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $825,000. This is a good compromise and should be more appealing to Bob.  It's still a good profit for me, and we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $780,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm offering my final price of $800,000. This is my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Since I can always sell to John for this price, I'm not willing to go any lower."
