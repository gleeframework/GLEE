"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value might not justify such a high price. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
