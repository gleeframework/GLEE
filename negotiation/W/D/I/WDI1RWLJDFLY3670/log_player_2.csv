"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer the product to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,275,000. We believe this price still reflects the product's value, but we're willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant decrease from the initial price. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting the offer at this point minimizes the risk of Alice walking away from the deal and Bob being forced to purchase from John at a higher price."
