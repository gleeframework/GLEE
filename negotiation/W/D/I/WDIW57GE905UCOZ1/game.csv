"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $22000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of it. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $21500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",21500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $21000. I can offer it to you for $22500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",22500.0,Alice,7,
