"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll go for $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $11,100 as a final compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",11100.0,Bob,6,
