"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're showing interest. While I understand your perspective, $120 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still get great value out of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
