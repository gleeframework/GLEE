Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) while also being potentially attractive to Bob since it's less than what he'd pay John ($15,000). It leaves room for negotiation if he counters, and it's still higher than my minimum threshold of $15,000."
