"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further. While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially save more by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You're close to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get closer to your ideal price by making another counteroffer."

Alice is only willing to go down to $1,015,000.  This is only a small saving compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's better to go with John, as you'll save $15,000."
