"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a little over budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
