"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. How about meeting in the middle at $875,000? This recognizes its worth while still leaving you with a significant gain.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to get closer to my original target of $750,000? Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
