"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $1,100,000 falls significantly below that.  Would you consider $1,300,000? I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
