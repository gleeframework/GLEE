"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see value in your product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to offer $700000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my desire to acquire the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is right in line with your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
