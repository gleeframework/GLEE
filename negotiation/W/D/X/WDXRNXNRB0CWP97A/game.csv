,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1200000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1600000? I believe this price is still fair, given the unique value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1200000. How about we try $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, and $1400000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1450000. It's a small difference, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment at this price point. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but no higher. If we can't meet at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800000. Can you think about it?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
