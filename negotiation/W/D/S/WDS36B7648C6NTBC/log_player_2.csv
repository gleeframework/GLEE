"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  
* Accepting the offer at $875,000 saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While further negotiation might be possible, it's a risk with limited rounds left. The potential savings might not outweigh the risk of losing the deal altogether."
