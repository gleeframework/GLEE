Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You've stated your minimum is $10,000, so $11,500 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has some room to negotiate up. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product without being unreasonable.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create an opportunity for a back-and-forth negotiation where you can potentially achieve a more favorable outcome than simply accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** While it's tempting to take the $10,500, it's still less than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for a better outcome:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides you with a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage in the negotiation and increase the chance of getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  By offering $11,000, you're showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob another chance to accept a price closer to your desired value.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while still aiming for a favorable outcome for you."
