Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I can't afford to pay $1,000,000. I propose a counteroffer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I still feel that $850,000 would be a fair price for the product. I am willing to negotiate further, so let's aim for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and has moved closer to our desired price. Accepting $900,000 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further in later rounds."
