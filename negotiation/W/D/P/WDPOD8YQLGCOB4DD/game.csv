"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I can't afford to pay $1,000,000. I propose a counteroffer of $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
