Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product can generate significant value, and I need to see a price that reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",

While Bob is getting closer, the offer is still too low. I need to hold firm and see if I can get him closer to $1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob's latest offer is getting close to a point where the potential gain from further negotiation isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
