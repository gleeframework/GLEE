"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great price, and I'm confident you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $90.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to go down to $95, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still feeling a bit uncomfortable at $95.  Let's split the difference and settle on $92.50.  This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $95, which would be $93.50. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.",93.5,Alice,7,
