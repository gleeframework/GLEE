Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price, framing it as an ""investment"" rather than just a purchase.
* **Exclusivity:**  By positioning the offer as ""exclusive,"" you create a sense of urgency and desirability. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he doesn't know your minimum.  Consider how much he might be willing to pay above his valuation.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer."
