Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is a high price, but it's still significantly less than your minimum and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
