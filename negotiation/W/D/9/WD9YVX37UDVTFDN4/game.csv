"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. Can you consider this offer?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $8,250 is still too low for me. Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,500. This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $8,250. If you're willing to accept this, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8250.0,Bob,6,
