"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the first offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much, and also gives you room to negotiate upward if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the bargaining process and potentially get a lower price. You've already shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down a little more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $110 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $105. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It's a small increment from your previous offer, making it more likely Alice will see it as a reasonable step towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to take another step towards you and offer it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $108, which is very close to your counteroffer of $105.  While you could continue negotiating,  the risk of her rejecting further offers or you losing interest in the deal is high. It's likely you won't get a significantly better price, so accepting her offer is the best choice to secure the product and save money compared to buying from John."
