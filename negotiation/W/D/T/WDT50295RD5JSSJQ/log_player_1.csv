Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** While not explicitly stated, implying that you have other options (listing it publicly) creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition.
* **Polite and Open:**  The tone remains respectful and invites Bob's feedback, encouraging a positive negotiation process. 

If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can then negotiate down, knowing her fallback option is selling to John for $15,000."
