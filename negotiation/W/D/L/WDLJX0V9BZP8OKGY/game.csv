"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
