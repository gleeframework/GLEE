"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering its worth and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's counteroffer:** Alice is now offering $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's offer of $13,000.
* **Potential for a better price is limited:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Alice will come down much further.
* **Opportunity cost:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate, or that Bob will run out of rounds before reaching a better price.  Additionally,  if Bob buys from John, he'll end up paying $15,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the most prudent decision in this round, securing the product for a price within Bob's budget while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
