"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be bluffing about another buyer and could be willing to lower the price. By rejecting her initial offer, you open the possibility of getting a better deal."
