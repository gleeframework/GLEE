"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $120. That's a great deal, and you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims it's worth $100 to you, you know your maximum price is $100.  Buying from John at $100 ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
