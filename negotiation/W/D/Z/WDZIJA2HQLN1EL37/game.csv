"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but there's still a gap between our valuations.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that's your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't agree to $1,350,000.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to show I'm serious. How about $1,225,000?  Let's close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
