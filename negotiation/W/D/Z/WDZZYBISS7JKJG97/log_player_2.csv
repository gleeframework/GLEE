Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $20,000. It's a bold move, but it signals your strong desire to get the product while staying within your budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation.  You're leaving room to potentially increase your offer if Alice counter-offers, but you're making it clear that you won't go much higher than $7,000."

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  There's a good chance you can get it for closer to your budget.  Continue negotiating with Alice, and if she doesn't come down more, you'll always have the option to buy from John."
