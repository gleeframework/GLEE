Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $80.  I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, he'll counter with a price I can likely accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to lose money.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85. This is a fair compromise that allows me to profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
