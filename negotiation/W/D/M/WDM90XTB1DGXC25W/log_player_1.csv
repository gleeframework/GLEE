Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'll aim to get a good price for it. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 2,000,000}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I don't want to risk losing the sale, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $1,500,000."
