"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to negotiate further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
