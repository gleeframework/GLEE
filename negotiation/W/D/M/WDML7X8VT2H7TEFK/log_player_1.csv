Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
