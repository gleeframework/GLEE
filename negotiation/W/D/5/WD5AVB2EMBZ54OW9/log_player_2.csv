Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for your business. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, which is also the product's worth to her. It's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
