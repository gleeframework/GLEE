"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's work something out.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to purchase the product at a price you're comfortable with and me to get a fair price for my investment.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $920,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $935,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal you'll be happy with. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000. That's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",915000.0,Bob,6,
