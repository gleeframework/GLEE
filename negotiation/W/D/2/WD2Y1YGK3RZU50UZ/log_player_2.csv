"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice is willing to sell it for $80. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $100 and my target price of $80. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to make a counteroffer if she wants to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within my budget of $120, and closer to my desired price of $80.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and me having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer is the most rational choice to ensure I get the product within my budget."
