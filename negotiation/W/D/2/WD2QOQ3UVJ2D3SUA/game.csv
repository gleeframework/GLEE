"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000.  That's a good compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is still a significant gap from what I need.  To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this work with you. How about $15,500 and we call it a deal?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500.  I can offer you $14,000. That's the absolute most I can go.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
