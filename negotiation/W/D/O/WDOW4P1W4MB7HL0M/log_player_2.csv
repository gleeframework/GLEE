"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your interest. Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy from John and save $20."
