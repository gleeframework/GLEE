"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. I believe this represents a fair value considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.  If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer ready to purchase at $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since she's asking for $850,000, which is more than the $800,000 I'm willing to pay. I'll look for a better deal.
