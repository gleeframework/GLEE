"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum allows room for negotiation and signals the product's importance. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential returns,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of value closer to our asking price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it establishes a strong bargaining position for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need it to be priced realistically. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and your desired selling price. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. While his counter-offer was expected, it's too early to settle. Proceeding to the next round allows you to negotiate towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a middle ground while still ensuring a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Decreasing the price by $300,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Firm:** The new price, while a significant reduction, is still substantially higher than Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Justifying the Price:**  Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" emphasizes that concessions have been made but also sets a boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to be realistic. While I believe this product has value,  $2,000,000 is still far too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by $150,000, which is a better sign than his previous counter, but it's still far below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiating Power:** You have John as a backup buyer, giving you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.  
* **Time Constraint:** While there's a time limit, you still have rounds to negotiate. Walking away now might be premature. 

You'll reject this offer to signal that Bob needs to significantly increase his offer if he wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that offer is still significantly below its true value.  To find a solution, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to see you benefit from this product."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, Calculated Risk:**  Dropping to $1,750,000 is a substantial move, designed to signal flexibility and encourage a serious counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Justification:** Framing it as a ""solution"" and highlighting your ""strong desire"" to see Bob benefit maintains a positive tone while subtly emphasizing your willingness to walk away.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, introducing a sense of urgency becomes more crucial. This offer aims to either secure a deal closer to your target or encourage Bob to reveal his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer, But Not There:** Bob's offer is now above his initial valuation, indicating progress, but it's still significantly under your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Bob. He's shown a willingness to move, and you need to see if he'll bridge the remaining gap.
* **John as Leverage:**  You have the security of John's offer, giving you a strong position to push back and aim for a better deal with Bob. 

You'll reject this offer, aiming for a counteroffer closer to, or ideally at, your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I can accept. This product is truly unique and will provide a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and signal that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Justifying the Price:**  You reiterate the product's value and the ""fair deal"" concept, emphasizing the value Bob will receive.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While holding firm above your $1,500,000 minimum, you meet Bob closer to the middle ground, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to push for a resolution, whether that's a deal with Bob near your target or moving on to John's guaranteed offer."
