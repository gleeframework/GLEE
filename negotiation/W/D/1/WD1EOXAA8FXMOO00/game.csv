"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need it to be priced realistically. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a middle ground while still ensuring a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to be realistic. While I believe this product has value,  $2,000,000 is still far too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's my limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that offer is still significantly below its true value.  To find a solution, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to see you benefit from this product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I can accept. This product is truly unique and will provide a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
