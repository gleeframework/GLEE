"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly agree on $8,500 for the product?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is still too far below my desired price.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This gives you a significant discount on a product that's worth a lot to you, and it's closer to my target price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be open to selling the product for $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to explore other options.",9000.0,Alice,7,
