{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands. I'm willing to let it go for $925,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high offer of $925,000 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be from a higher starting point.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob justifies the high price and makes it seem like a worthwhile investment.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum."
