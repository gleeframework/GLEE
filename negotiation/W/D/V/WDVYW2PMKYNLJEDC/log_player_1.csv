Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room for counteroffers and ensures you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $95?  That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
