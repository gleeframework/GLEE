Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your research. However, I have to say that $8000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counteroffer at $10500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
