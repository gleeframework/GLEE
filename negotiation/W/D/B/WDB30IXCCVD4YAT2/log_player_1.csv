"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $10,500 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind, as that's my safety net if I can't reach an agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $10,800 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid selling to John, but I need to keep trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have a few rounds left and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
