"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $10,800 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
