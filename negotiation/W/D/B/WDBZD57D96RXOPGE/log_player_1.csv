Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives Bob an opportunity to accept a price that's beneficial to you while still being below his perceived value.
* **Clear and Confident Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. You could experiment with different starting prices and messaging to see what yields the best results."
