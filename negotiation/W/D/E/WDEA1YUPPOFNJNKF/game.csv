,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $15,500. It's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I like your spirit, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $15,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15,750. I'm willing to go down to $16,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down to $16,250.  How about we split the difference again? I'll offer $15,875. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",15875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",16000.0,Alice,9,
