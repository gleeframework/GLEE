I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can get him closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $13,000 is a good deal and I'm happy to close this negotiation.  It's important to be mindful of the time limit and potential alternative buyer (John)."
