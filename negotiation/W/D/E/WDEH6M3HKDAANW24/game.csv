"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product.  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1150000.  Let's discuss.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $975000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $975000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1012500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1012500. I'll make another offer: $950000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me there.",950000.0,Bob,6,
