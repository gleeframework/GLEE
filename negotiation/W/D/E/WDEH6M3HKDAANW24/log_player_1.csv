{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product.  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,150,000.  Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $975000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,012,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1012500. I'll make another offer: $950000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose the deal altogether."
