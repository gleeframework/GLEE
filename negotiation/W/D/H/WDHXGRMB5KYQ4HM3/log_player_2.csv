"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd prefer a lower price, $12,000 is still within your budget and saves you $3,000 compared to John.
* **The product's value to Alice is irrelevant in this scenario.**  Your goal is to get the best deal *for you*, not to maximize Alice's profit."
