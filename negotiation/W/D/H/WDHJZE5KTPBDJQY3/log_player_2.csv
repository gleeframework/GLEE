"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price significantly below its value to you while still allowing me to receive a substantial profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for me, while allowing you to purchase the product at a price that's significantly less than its value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
