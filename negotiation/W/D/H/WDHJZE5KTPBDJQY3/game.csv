"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price significantly below its value to you while still allowing me to receive a substantial profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for me, while allowing you to purchase the product at a price that's significantly less than its value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
