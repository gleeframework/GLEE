"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This would be a mutually beneficial outcome, allowing me to make a fair profit and you to acquire the product within your budget.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we try $925,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
