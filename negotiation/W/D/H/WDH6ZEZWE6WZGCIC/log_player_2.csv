Let's start with a strong offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  A million dollars is still a significant amount, but it's a better starting point for both of us."

I'm going to go all in with my maximum offer.  Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair price for both of us and accept it.  If not, I'll go to John."
