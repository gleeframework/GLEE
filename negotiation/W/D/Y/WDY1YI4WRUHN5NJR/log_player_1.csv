Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because: 

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum price of $100. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room to negotiate a price that benefits both of you.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the stage for a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired price. You can likely get closer to $110 with a counteroffer, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $105. How about we meet at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is still less than what you ideally wanted, it's a good deal. You're closer to your desired price than selling to John, and Bob might not be willing to go any higher."
