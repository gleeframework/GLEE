"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount. Let's split the difference again and go with $135.  It's still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $138? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",138.0,Alice,5,
