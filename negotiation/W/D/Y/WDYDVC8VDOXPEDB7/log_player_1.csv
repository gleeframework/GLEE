"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point, as Bob values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and get us closer to a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing the deal altogether."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more.  With only two rounds left, I'm going to try one more counteroffer, hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

This is the last round, and Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. If I reject this offer, I'll have to sell to John for the same amount, so I might as well accept and close the deal."
