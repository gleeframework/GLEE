"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows some flexibility on my end. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $950,000, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring you.
