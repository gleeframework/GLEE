"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's not a good deal to accept Alice's offer as it is over your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also shows some flexibility on my end. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your goal of saving as much money as possible. You can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $950,000, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now asking for $1,050,000, which is still more than you want to pay.  While you could continue negotiating, it's clear you're both unwilling to budge much further.  Since John is selling the product for $1,000,000, it's a better deal to go with him."
