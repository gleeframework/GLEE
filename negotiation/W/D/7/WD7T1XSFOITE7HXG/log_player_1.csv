"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, at least $10,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial offer is $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to explore if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Being open:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to me and my willingness to negotiate. This shows Bob I'm open to a deal but also positions the price as fair.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The starting price isn't outrageous, so Bob is more likely to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching closely for Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer strategy based on his counteroffer, and keep the alternative of selling to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $11,000 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000. I wouldn't be making a profit at that price.
* **Potential for better deal:** I know the product is worth more to Bob, and there's room for him to increase his offer.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 10 rounds, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'll also keep the option to sell to John in mind if the negotiations don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $12,000.  This still leaves a good margin for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but also protecting my minimum profit margin. 
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth more to him and that this price allows for both of us to benefit. 
* **Maintaining negotiation:** I'm not giving up on a better deal but showing a willingness to be flexible. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response.  If he rejects, I'll continue to adjust my offers, keeping John's offer as a safety net.  The goal is to reach a price that works for both of us while maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I would prefer more, $10,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity cost:**  I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and continuing could risk Bob walking away or me needing to accept an even lower offer later. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I know I can still sell to John for $10,000 if things go wrong.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob and move forward with the transaction.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup if any unexpected issues arise."
