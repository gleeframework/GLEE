"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is your budget for the product, but I have to consider my own costs and profits. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
