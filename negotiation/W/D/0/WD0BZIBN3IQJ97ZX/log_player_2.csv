"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can get a better deal than $140.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice's offer of $137.50 is within your budget. It's a good deal, and you can save some money compared to buying from John."
