Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $170 is a bit lower than I initially hoped for, it's still significantly more than selling to John.  It seems like Bob is firm on his price, and it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether."
