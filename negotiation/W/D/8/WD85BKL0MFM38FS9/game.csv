"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1500000.  This reflects the product's significant value and the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1350000 is closer to my initial offer, I still need to ensure a fair return on this unique product.  Let's compromise further. I'm willing to lower the price to $1400000. This reflects both the value of the product and our need to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. While $1250000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise again. My new offer is $1300000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  While I understand you're on a budget, $1250000 just doesn't reflect the full value of this unique product. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1275000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like we may be at an impasse.  I understand you're on a budget, but $1225000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, but I'm not going lower than $1250000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to go this high, I'll have to explore other options.  I'm confident I can find someone else who values this product at a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know your final decision.",1250000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay more than $1225000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options, including buying the product from John for $1200000.",1225000.0,Bob,10,
