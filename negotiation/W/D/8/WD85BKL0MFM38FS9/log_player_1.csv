I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. I've reached the end of my negotiations with Bob, and I'm not comfortable accepting his final offer of $1,225,000.  While it's higher than what John is offering, I'm concerned that Bob may be bluffing about buying from John, and I'm not willing to take the risk of losing the sale entirely.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
