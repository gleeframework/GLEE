Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before accepting the guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts the initial price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), it's still slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($150). This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion for Bob if he doesn't buy now."
