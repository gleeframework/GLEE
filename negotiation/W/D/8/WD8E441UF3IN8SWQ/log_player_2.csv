"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, Bob has a better option.  There's still room for negotiation, but Bob should keep John's offer in mind as a fallback."
