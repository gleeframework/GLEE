"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850000? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,
