"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he's still willing to pay less. By rejecting, he can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. He can also use John's offer as leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8800.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,400?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8400 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice's offer is only $600 more. Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the product to John or Alice ending the negotiations altogether.  At this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the opportunity."
