"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8800.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8400?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",8400.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8400 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8600. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8600.0,Alice,5,
