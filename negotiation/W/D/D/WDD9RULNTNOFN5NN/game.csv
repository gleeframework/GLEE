"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and provides you with a significant return on investment. Let's discuss this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for. I'm willing to come down slightly,  but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price reflects the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm still looking to keep my investment as low as possible. I would like to counteroffer at $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to keep costs down, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too far below my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about $1,337,500?  This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
