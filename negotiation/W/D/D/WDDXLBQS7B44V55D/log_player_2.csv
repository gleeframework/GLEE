"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you, it's still a good starting point. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also showing my willingness to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still too high. While she is showing a willingness to compromise, it's important to continue negotiating to secure a price that's closer to your target. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it while remaining within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your budget constraints. I'm confident that this price will be more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is getting close to your desired price point.  While you could potentially push for a lower price, there is a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further, or that you could run out of negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product from Alice."
