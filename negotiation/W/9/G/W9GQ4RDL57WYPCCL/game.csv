"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to meet my minimum of $9,000. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
