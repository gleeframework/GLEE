Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
