"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value and my opportunity cost.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'd like to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can work together to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too far from my ideal price.  However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we settle on $975,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this number.",962500.0,Alice,7,
