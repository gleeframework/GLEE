{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to get Bob to respond and express his interest. This allows me to gauge his initial reaction. 

I'm confident that this offer will be a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth more than $150 to me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175? It's a good price, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Justification:** I provide a brief justification for my counter-offer, highlighting the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. 
* **Closing Statement:** I end with a positive and persuasive statement to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $175. Would you consider $160 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and closer to my desired price than my previous counter-offer.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
