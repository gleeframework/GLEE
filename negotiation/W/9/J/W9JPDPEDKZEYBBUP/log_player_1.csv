Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially land a price closer to my minimum desired value of $150.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $150.  I'm willing to risk a bit more and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This is still above Bob's offer of $120, but it's closer to my desired minimum.  I believe this counteroffer might be appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum desired value of $150, I'm no longer confident that I can convince Bob to go higher.  I'm  happy to accept John's offer of $150 and avoid any further negotiation risk."
