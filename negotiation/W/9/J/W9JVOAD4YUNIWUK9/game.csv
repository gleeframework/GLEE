"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  My starting price is $115.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can work something out.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  Let's make this happen!",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $112.50.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.",112.5,Alice,5,
