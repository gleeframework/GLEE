"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $120.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $112.50.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
