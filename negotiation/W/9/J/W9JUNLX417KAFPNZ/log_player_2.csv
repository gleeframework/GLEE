"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a product of incredible value.  I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  While I understand your perspective on market value, this product is truly unique and has a potential far exceeding comparable items.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet at $1200000? This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
