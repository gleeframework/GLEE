"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15500? It's a good compromise and within my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $16500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
