Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving you a good profit margin. It's also lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him a potential benefit for making a deal. This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and incentivizing Bob to accept the offer."
