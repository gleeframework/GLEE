"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $110.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my initial offer and is still a better deal than selling to John.  We're nearing the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
