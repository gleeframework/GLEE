"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17000.

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is the best I can do, considering its value to me is no less than $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
