**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we're now at $11,000.  This is a significant profit over my minimum ($8,000) and there's a risk he'll walk away if I push further. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
