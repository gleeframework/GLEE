{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I want to see if I can get closer to the value I've placed on the product.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $100.  I believe that John is a reliable buyer and I'm guaranteed to get my minimum value from him.  I'm going to choose to sell to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
