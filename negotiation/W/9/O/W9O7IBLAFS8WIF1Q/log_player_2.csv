Alice's starting price is higher than I'd like. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90, so how about $100?
