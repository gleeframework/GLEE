{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still provides me with a significant return.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's ambitious:** I'm aiming high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a clear gap between my offer and Bob's potential value, allowing for counteroffers.
* **It's fair:**  It provides me with a substantial profit while still being attractive to Bob.

I'm prepared to negotiate, but I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my target. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  Let's split the difference and meet at $925,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and a strong return for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price point, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'll accept his offer and secure a strong profit."
