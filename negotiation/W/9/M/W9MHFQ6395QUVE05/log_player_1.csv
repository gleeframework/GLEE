"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on the value to Bob. This may encourage him to accept the offer without much resistance. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  Leaving some room for counteroffers allows for a negotiation process and potentially a better outcome for both of us. 

**Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I have several rounds left, and there's an opportunity to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, there's a chance I can get more from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value it brings to you, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** Using a positive and collaborative tone can encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strategic move. By lowering the price but still maintaining a healthy profit margin, I am increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob. I'm also hoping to avoid a lengthy negotiation and secure a sale before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's offer is equal:**  John is also offering $1,500,000, so there's no advantage to selling to John over Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:** It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale.  While I would ideally like to get more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. This outcome is still within my acceptable range and allows me to achieve my minimum goal."
