I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my guaranteed minimum:** I'm sure to make a profit, even if Bob rejects.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is truly interested, we can work out a price closer to his value.
* **It demonstrates my confidence in the product:** A higher starting price signals that I believe the product is valuable. 

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob counter-offers."
