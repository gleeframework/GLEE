"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I acknowledge its value to me, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $700,000. This would still be a profitable deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for a price that truly benefits both of us. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This represents a fair price that allows for a successful transaction.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $750,000 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $795,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think!",795000.0,Alice,5,
