# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  There's room for negotiation. I can counter-offer at a lower price and try to get closer to her minimum."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can likely get it lower. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving room for negotiation."
