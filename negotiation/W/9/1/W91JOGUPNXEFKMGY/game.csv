"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking $90 would be a more comfortable price for me.,90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'm starting to think about my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $108?",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really liking the product, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer.",92.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $92, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'll meet you in the middle at $100, but that's as low as I can go",100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it a lot, and I'm really not willing to pay more than $90. It's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away.",90.0,Bob,10,
