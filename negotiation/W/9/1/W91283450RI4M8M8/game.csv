"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
