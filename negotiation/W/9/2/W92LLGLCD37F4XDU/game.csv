"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a little low for me, I could come down to $180. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about $95? That's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this item. Let's make this work - how about $160? That's a significant reduction on my end and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the true value of what you're getting.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here, but $160 is still pushing it for me.  I'm willing to offer $100 for it.  That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,6,
