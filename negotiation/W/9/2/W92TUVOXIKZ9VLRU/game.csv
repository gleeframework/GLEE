"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1300000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I can offer you a price of $1200000 is not an option, but I can offer you a price of $1150000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
