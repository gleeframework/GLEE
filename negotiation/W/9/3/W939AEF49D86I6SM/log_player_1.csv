Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $87.50 is a better deal than selling to John and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price with Bob."
