Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. Bob might be willing to pay a premium, especially if the product's value to him is significant.
* **Confident Approach:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and suggesting a sense of opportunity."
