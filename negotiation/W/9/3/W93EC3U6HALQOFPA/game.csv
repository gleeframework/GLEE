"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000 to show you my commitment to a deal. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a valuable asset. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, and I think that's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
