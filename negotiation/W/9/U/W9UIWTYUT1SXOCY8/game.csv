"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer. I'm thinking of $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1600000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
