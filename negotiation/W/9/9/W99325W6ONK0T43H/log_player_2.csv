"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity and I believe you'd find it highly valuable. I'm asking for $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying more than my maximum limit of $1,200,000. I'll try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,150,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. How about $1,250,000? This price is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product, and it leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let's aim for a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my absolute maximum budget. Let's close the deal at this price and avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
