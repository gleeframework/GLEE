Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already getting a good price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $500 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, which allows for some negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** Offering a price closer to your ideal price rather than starting too low shows confidence in the value of your product.

If Bob rejects, you can analyze his counteroffer and either accept, make a counter-counteroffer, or go with John's offer of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is still above my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you.  Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $8,750 is close to my minimum and likely the best I'll get from him.  There's a chance he'll reject my next counteroffer, and I'm not sure I can get more from him.  Selling to John for $8,000 is still an option, but accepting Bob's offer is the more profitable choice at this point."
