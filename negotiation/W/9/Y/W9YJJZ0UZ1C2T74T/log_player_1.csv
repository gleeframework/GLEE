"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,100,000. I believe it offers significant potential for your needs."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price, even if it's above Bob's estimated worth. 
* **Anchoring:** This high starting point acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be higher than it would have been otherwise.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it brings. However, I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is at his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side.  While accepting would close the deal, it would be at a significant loss compared to selling to John.  

It's more strategic to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to your minimum, aiming to explore if a mutually beneficial deal is possible before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. To move us closer, I'm willing to offer it at $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price, signaling flexibility but also demonstrating the product's value.
* **Justification:** We're reinforcing the product's benefits, subtly reminding Bob of its potential return on investment.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** This counteroffer still aims for a price well above our minimum and provides room for further negotiation if Bob counters.

This approach keeps us in the game, avoids a stalemate, and maintains the possibility of a more favorable outcome than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement closer to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches the price John is willing to pay. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of losing both offers is significant.  

* **Profitable Outcome:** Accepting guarantees a sale at our minimum acceptable price, which is a good outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations has a cost, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting now secures the profit.
* **Potential for Future Business:** A successful deal with Bob, even at this price, could lead to future opportunities. 
 
Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the most logical decision at this stage."
