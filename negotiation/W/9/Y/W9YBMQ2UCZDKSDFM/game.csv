"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 is still too far off from what I need.  How about we split the difference one more time? I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is my final offer. Let's seal the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
