"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point.",9000.0,Bob,4,
