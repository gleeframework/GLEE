Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to maximize my earnings, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a reasonable amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is a better deal than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
