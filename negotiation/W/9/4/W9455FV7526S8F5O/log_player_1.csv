{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also high enough that Bob might be tempted to accept, given that he values the product at $800,000. 

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and continue negotiating until I reach a price that's acceptable to me or choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could accept and make a profit, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my goal. I'll make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm still trying to work with you on this.  $1,250,000 is very close, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $1,325,000?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. Can you consider this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is still too low for me.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not sure we'll be able to come to an agreement that meets both of our needs.  Rather than continuing to negotiate, I'll accept John's offer of $1,500,000. This will ensure I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
