"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still trying to work with you on this.  $1,250,000 is very close, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
