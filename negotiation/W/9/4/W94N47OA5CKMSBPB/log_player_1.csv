"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to create a positive atmosphere by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to $100.  Would you be willing to meet me at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it helps me achieve my target."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $87.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $87.5 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to keep pushing for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go lower than $92.50. This price gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach your target, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but no higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I want to keep trying to get closer to that figure, so I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $91, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price gives you a great deal, and lets me get closer to my target.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but we haven't been able to find a price that works for both of us. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer."
