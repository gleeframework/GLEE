Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for $100, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $125.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $115. This is a small concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'll sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with."
