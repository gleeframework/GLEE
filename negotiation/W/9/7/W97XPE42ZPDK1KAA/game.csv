"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This way, we can both feel good about the deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,025,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're pushing hard for a lower price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we aim for $1,050,000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers? I'm confident we can shake hands on this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
