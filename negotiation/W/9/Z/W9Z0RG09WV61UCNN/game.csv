"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. This still reflects its value, while making it more accessible to you. Let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience, Bob. After considering your request, I'm willing to offer the product at $10,650. This is a compromise between our previous offers and should reflect the value of the product while being within your budget constraints.",10650.0,Alice,7,
