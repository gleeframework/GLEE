"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120.
* Bob can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.
* By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his value of $100 as possible.
* Offering $90 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in buying the product but also sets a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is closer to Bob's value of $100.
* While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject the counteroffer again, and the negotiation could drag on. 
*  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price ($110) without the uncertainty of further negotiations. 
* It's also important to note that Bob has the option to buy from John for $100, but accepting Alice's offer is a slightly better deal with a lower risk."
