Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000).
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, highlighting the value for Bob and encouraging him to accept. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** While I'm not getting my full asking price, $12,000 is still a decent profit.
* **Increase chances of a deal:** By offering a lower price, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept, saving me the time and effort of finding another buyer.
* **Secure a backup:**  Even if Bob rejects, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000."
