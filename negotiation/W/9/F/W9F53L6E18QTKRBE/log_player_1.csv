{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you.  Please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000. Therefore, she starts the negotiation with Bob significantly above Bob's perceived value but below John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is still in a strong position to secure a price significantly higher than his initial valuation. 
* **Urgency:** By suggesting a timely decision, Alice encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on the opportunity."
