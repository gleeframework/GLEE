I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000.  This is the price I would get from John if Bob rejects the offer, so it's the best possible outcome for me.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little more to secure the deal.  However, he's not going to pay more than $1,200,000, since he can always get it from John for that price."
