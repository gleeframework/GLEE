"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's close to my minimum value and still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I hope this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
