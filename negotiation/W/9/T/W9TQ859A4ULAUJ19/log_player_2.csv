Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

We're getting close to my limit, and Alice is unlikely to come down much further. Accepting at $11,250 is a good compromise."
