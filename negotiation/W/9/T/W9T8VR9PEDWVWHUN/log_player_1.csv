{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for negotiation. The friendly message aims to build a rapport with Bob and create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in buying if you're willing to come down to $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is higher than my absolute minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price yet.  I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price range by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it seems like he's firm on that price. Accepting his offer is the most logical choice, as it secures a profit while avoiding the risk of a prolonged negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
