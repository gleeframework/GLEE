"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also fitting within my financial constraints. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
