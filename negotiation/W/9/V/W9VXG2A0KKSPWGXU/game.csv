"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $90, which is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $92.50? This way, we both get a good deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a little above my limit. How about $91?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",91.0,Bob,6,
