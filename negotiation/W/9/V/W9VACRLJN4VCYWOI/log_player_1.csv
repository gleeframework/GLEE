"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000) but still allows for potential negotiation and a good profit margin. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he's getting, while still emphasizing my own perspective on the product's worth. 
* **Strategy:** This is a starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm leaving room for him to counteroffer, but I'm also ready to move on to John if Bob doesn't seem interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation.  

* **Reasoning:** I have 9 more rounds to reach a deal, and John is a reliable alternative if needed. I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still gives me some room to make a profit, but I want to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a good margin for myself. The $10,500 price is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but focusing on the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. The ""common ground"" phrase emphasizes cooperation.
* **Strategy:** By showing willingness to negotiate, I hope to increase Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still keeping the door open to John if needed, but I'm optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it would be ideal to get closer to $11,000 or even $12,000, I've already made a significant concession. There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away entirely, or I could end up making a counteroffer that he rejects, leaving me with no deal at all. 

* **Reasoning:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the time pressure is increasing. Taking this offer ensures I receive a significant profit and avoids the potential risk of a complete breakdown in negotiations. 
* **Outcome:** Accepting the offer allows me to secure a deal relatively quickly and move on to other opportunities, as I'm still getting a good return on my product."
