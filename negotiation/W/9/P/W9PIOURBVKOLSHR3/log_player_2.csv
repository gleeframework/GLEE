"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $100, but it's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where I'm willing to buy.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she came down a bit,  $90 is still above my target price. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate further. There are still plenty of rounds left, so I can see if I can get her down closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit high at $90. How about $88? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of incrementally lowering the price.  $88 is a small step down from Alice's offer, but it shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice still isn't comfortable with the price."
