This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product at this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's still above my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to come up a bit from $1,150,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
