"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. I would like to propose a price of $820,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $820,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, hoping to get a better price.  I can still walk away and sell to John, but I want to see if I can secure a higher deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe it's worth more than $820,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $875,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I am willing to consider $860,000 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and having to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and secures the sale."
