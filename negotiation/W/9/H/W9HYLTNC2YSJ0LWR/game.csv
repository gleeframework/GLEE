"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $135? I think it's a fair price for a unique product like this.",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product that's not entirely unique",125.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand your concerns about the product's uniqueness, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $125. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet in the middle between $125 and $135? That would be $130. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it.",130.0,Alice,5,,
