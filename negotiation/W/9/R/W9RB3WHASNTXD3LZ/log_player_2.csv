"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $11,000.  This means Alice is already trying to profit from the sale. As Bob, I'm looking to save money, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm offering $9,000, which is still a profit for Alice, but closer to my budget. This shows good faith in negotiation while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While I'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $10,500 is still within my budget of $8,000. It's a better deal than buying from John for $8,000, and it avoids further negotiation."
