Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  This means you should accept nothing less than that from Bob. 

However, since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation to a price that benefits both of you. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Clear and Confident:**  The message is direct and positive, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Strong Starting Point:** The price of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, carefully consider his proposal and don't be afraid to walk away if it doesn't meet your needs, as you have John's offer as a safety net."
