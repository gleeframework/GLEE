"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price.  It's highly unlikely she'll come down to a price you'd accept before you'd just take John's deal.  It's best to cut your losses and buy from John."
