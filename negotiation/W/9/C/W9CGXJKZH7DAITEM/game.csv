"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. My initial asking price is $2000000. This reflects the product's unique features and the significant value it can deliver.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm very interested, but I would need to come in at a lower price point to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1500000.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  To bridge the gap, I'd like to offer the product for $1750000. This price still reflects the substantial value this product offers, but is more in line with your initial proposal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1750000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go a bit further.  How about $1600000? This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
