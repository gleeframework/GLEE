Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows. I'm very interested, but I would need to come in at a lower price point to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1500000.  Let me know what you think.
