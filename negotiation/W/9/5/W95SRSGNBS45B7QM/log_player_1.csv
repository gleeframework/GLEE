"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me room to negotiate if necessary. I want to maximize my profit, but also want to encourage Bob to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still above my minimum of $150, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a good middle ground and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160. This is still above my minimum, but it's getting closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, we are running out of time. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price. Selling to John for $150 is the safer option and guarantees me at least my minimum."
