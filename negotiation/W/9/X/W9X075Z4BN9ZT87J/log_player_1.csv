Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $18,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so there's no risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle. His message suggests he's willing to negotiate (""Could we possibly meet in the middle?""). By rejecting his offer and countering, you can explore if he's willing to go higher than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  You've significantly lowered your initial price to signal flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This approach often encourages the other party to negotiate further.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves you room to negotiate down a bit further if needed, while potentially securing a sale price above your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's value while showing a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to consider $14,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the incremental gain might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away from the deal.  
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to your desired price range, indicating a willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer shows you're also willing to meet him partway and close the deal."
