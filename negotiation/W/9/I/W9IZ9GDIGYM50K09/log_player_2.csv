"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, right?  I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is starting with a high price, but you know the product is worth $10,000 to her. 
* You have a higher limit of $12,000, so there's room to negotiate. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, as we know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.
* This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to save money. 
*  My counteroffer is close to my limit of $12,000, so it's a fair offer, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still higher than my ideal price.
* I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target.
* While buying from John is an option, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's latest offer.
* This shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to do the same. 
* I'm still below my maximum price of $12,000, leaving some room for potential further negotiation."
