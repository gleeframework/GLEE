"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
