"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. Could you do $11,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. I'm ready to buy this today, but I need to be at $12,000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
