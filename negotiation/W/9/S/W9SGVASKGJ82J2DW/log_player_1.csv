Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value to you, and it allows me to earn a good price as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $750,000 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  Bob recognizes the value of the product, and I'm willing to work with him to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. This still offers significant savings for me, while also allowing you to earn closer to your target price. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $800,000, and I've already rejected John's offer for that amount.  It's also a reasonable price for Bob, considering his valuation.  It's best to accept this offer and close the deal."
