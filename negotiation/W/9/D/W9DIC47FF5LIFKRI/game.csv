"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I am interested in the product,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,800,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation.  While $1,600,000 is close, I'm aiming to stay closer to $1,500,000.  Would you accept $1,450,000? I believe this is a strong offer and would allow us to close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
