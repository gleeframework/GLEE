{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  While Bob values the product at $80, I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay more, especially since he's shown interest.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still leaves me a good margin and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $110 as my maximum price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. It's best to go with the sure thing and sell to John for $150."
