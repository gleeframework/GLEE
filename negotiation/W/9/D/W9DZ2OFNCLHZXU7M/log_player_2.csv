"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and she's offering it for $14,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try for a lower price.**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you're not losing out on the product entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500.  I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating. However, it's still within the range you're willing to pay.
* **Focus on value and closing:** The message emphasizes the value you see in the product and your willingness to close the deal. This puts pressure on Alice to accept, while also appearing reasonable. 
* **Keep backup option in mind:**  You're still aware that John is an option if Alice rejects your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm happy to accept $13250 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** She's met you halfway, and the price is closer to your initial goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** You've already gotten a decent discount, and there's a chance Alice might not budge further.  
* **Buying from John is still a backup, but it's riskier.**  While John offers a guarantee, you'll be paying a higher price than Alice's latest offer.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer minimizes your risk and secures a good deal."
