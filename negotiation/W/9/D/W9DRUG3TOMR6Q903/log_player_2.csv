**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your walk-away price of $1,200,000 (buying from John). By rejecting this offer, you create the opportunity to:

* **Negotiate:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely.  
* **Stick with John:** You have a guaranteed backup option with John, ensuring you won't be left without the product.

You have more to gain by rejecting this offer and exploring other possibilities."
