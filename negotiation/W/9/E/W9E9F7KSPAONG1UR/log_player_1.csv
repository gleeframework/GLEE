Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm running out of time and I'm worried that I won't be able to get a good enough price from Bob.  I'm going to make one last counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has been unwilling to meet my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is much better than the $100 Bob is offering.  I need to secure the best possible deal, and selling to John is the best option at this point."
