"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a fair profit for you.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to counter your offer. I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still offers a good profit margin while acknowledging your valuation of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a good compromise between our positions. I'm confident this price is fair, given the product's value to me and your need to make a profit.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
