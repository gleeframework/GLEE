"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This is slightly above the minimum asking price, but I'm confident it represents an excellent investment for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's minimum asking price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds and can potentially get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  This gives you leverage to walk away if negotiations with Alice don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a fair profit for you.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to counter your offer. I propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This still offers a good profit margin while acknowledging your valuation of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your preferred price point.
* **You've already established a lower price range.** Your counteroffer of $1,050,000 signaled your willingness to negotiate, and you should stick to that general area. 
* **You have more rounds to negotiate.**  There's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's still not ideal, especially with the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a good compromise between our positions. I'm confident this price is fair, given the product's value to me and your need to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a further concession. I propose a price of $1,085,000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product to both parties and allows for a satisfactory profit margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $1,085,000 is only $35,000 above your last counteroffer.
* **You're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation.**  With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that continuing to reject offers could lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate, or you might end up paying more with John. 
* **The offer is within your budget.**  You're still comfortably below your maximum of $1,200,000.

While you might be able to get a slightly better price with more rounds of negotiation, accepting this offer balances your desire for a lower price with the risk of losing the deal or paying more to John."
