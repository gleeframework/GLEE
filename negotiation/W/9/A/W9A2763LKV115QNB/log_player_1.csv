Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while ensuring I still make a good profit."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'm confident that I can counteroffer and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than selling to John. It's important to recognize the potential for further negotiation, but at this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit."
