,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,450,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's try to close the gap and find a mutually agreeable price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $1,350,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this happen.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1,375,000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
