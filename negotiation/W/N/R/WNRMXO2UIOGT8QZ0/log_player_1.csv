{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for you. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer while emphasizing the value of the product.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Starting High:** This approach allows for negotiation and potential for a higher price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer or opt to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss for you.  

Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price that is closer to your minimum value. This keeps the negotiation open and gives you a better chance of achieving a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  This is still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is $3,000 higher than Bob's offer, bringing it closer to your minimum acceptable price while still being a compromise. 
* **Message:**  The message reaffirms your willingness to negotiate, reiterates the value of the product, and highlights the discount being offered. This encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Balancing Interests:**  This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance between your desired price and the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By offering a discount, you demonstrate your willingness to compromise, which is crucial in negotiations.
* **Keep Options Open:**  If Bob rejects again, you can either accept John's offer or make another counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's still below your desired profit margin.  

Rejecting his offer allows you to make a final counteroffer that aims to secure a price closer to your minimum value. This approach is more strategic than accepting a price that leaves you with a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one last offer of $10,500. This is my final price, and it reflects the true value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a slight decrease from your previous offer but still above your minimum acceptable price. The message clearly states it's a final offer to signal seriousness.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fair price, highlighting that it's a win-win situation for both parties.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential:** This offer maximizes your potential profit while staying within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **End Negotiation:**  The ""final offer"" message provides a clear ultimatum to Bob, potentially pushing him to accept.
* **Preparation for John:** If Bob rejects, you're ready to accept John's offer of $12,000 as a backup."
