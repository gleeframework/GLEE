"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which still leaves some room for you to profit. Let's find a middle ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $120, so I'll offer $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $110 is still a bit too low. I'm feeling more comfortable with $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'll try to find a middle ground again. I'll offer $112.50. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $115. How about we meet at $113.50?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",113.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $113.50. I'll try to find a middle ground again. I'll offer $112.00. Can you consider that?",112.0,Bob,8,
