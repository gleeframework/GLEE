"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1600000. Can you meet me at that price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1600000, which would be $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to go up to $1650000. Can you consider that?",1650000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $1680000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1680000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1680000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $1620000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1620000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the product's minimum value. I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I need to stress that this is my absolute final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1650000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1500000.",1600000.0,Bob,10,
