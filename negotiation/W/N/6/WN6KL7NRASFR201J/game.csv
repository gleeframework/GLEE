"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16,000. I can meet you in the middle at $18,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $17,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $17,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $18,500. Can we meet at that price?",18500.0,Alice,5,
