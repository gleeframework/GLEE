"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. It's a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
