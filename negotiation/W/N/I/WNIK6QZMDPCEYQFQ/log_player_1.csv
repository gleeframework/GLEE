``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to take that small hit to close the deal.  It's likely that further negotiation will only take more time and might not result in a significantly better offer.  I'm happy to secure a sale at this point."
