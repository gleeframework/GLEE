"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $110 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. How about we try $108? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay under $110.",108.0,Bob,4,
