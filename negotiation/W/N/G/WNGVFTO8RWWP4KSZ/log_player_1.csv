{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 gives Bob the impression of a deal while leaving some wiggle room if he tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **High But Reasonable:** While $9,500 is significantly more than Bob values the product at ($8,000), it's still within a potentially justifiable range if he's highly interested. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob tends to be very price-sensitive, starting a bit lower might be necessary.
* **Product Urgency:** If you need to sell the product quickly, a slightly lower price might be more attractive to Bob."
