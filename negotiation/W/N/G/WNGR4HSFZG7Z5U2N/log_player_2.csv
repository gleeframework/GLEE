"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you and Alice is offering it for $115. This is a good price, but you want to try and save more. You'll start by rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's split the difference and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still aiming to get the price lower.  While $110 is better than $115, you can likely negotiate further.  You'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $108?  That's a good compromise and will allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $108 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $109, which is a good price for you. It's closer to your target price than John's offer, and you've already rejected her counteroffers twice.  There's a good chance she won't budge further, and you risk losing out on this product altogether. It's time to accept the offer and secure the deal."
