"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can derive from the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I can't quite agree to $1,800,000. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I'm confident this price reflects a win-win scenario for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,900,000. I hope this is a more agreeable price for both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
