"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for a product worth more to me than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a low price just yet. There are 8 rounds left, and I can still potentially get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,250 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is below my minimum price of $10,000, it's still a better deal than what I would get if I sold to John right now.  I've also had a few rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Bob's price isn't going to budge much higher. It's worth securing the sale at this price and moving on."
