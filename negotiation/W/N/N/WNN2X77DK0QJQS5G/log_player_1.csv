{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate down if he wants.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a potential compromise. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll always keep in mind my minimum value of $10,000 from John, and I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before settling.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Would you consider accepting an offer of $9,100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is just above my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to take this deal to avoid risking a complete breakdown of negotiations.  I'm confident I can still make a good profit, and it's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing out on the deal entirely."
