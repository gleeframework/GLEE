Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to give myself some room to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $150, so I want to stay above $135 to ensure I get a better deal than selling to John.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $135 allows for potential negotiation. If Bob counteroffers, I have room to lower the price slightly without going below my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $130? It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still within my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $130 is still a good price for me, considering John is willing to pay $150. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $125. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer and might not result in a significantly higher price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of Bob backing out entirely or of John potentially changing his mind.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $128."
