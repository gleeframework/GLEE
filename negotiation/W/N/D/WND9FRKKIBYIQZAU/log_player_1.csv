{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting the offer at $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  Let's see if I can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest!  While I'm open to negotiating, $8,000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, $9,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm happy to close at this point."
