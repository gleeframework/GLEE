"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting the offer at $12000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by offering his maximum price. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also sets a clear boundary. He's hoping to close the deal quickly at a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you showing interest!  While I'm open to negotiating, $8000 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to get Alice down to a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing he's willing to compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer.  $9,000 is still within his budget and represents a good middle ground. He's hoping to close the deal in this round, but if Alice rejects, he'll need to carefully consider his options in subsequent rounds."
