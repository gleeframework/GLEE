"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $9,000. I am willing to stick to my original offer of $8,000. Is there any possibility we could reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is holding firm at his valuation of $8,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome. Since John offers the same price, it's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the sale with John."
