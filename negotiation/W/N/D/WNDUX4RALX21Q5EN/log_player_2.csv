"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high. He can potentially save money by counteroffering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is closer to Bob's ideal price. However, John is still offering the product for $8,000. Bob should take the guaranteed deal with John and save himself $1,500. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks the possibility of a stalemate or a higher price than John's."
