Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
