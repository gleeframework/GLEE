{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me, hoping to get as close to that $100 minimum as possible. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $100.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob, but I'll keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, it seems like we're at an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
