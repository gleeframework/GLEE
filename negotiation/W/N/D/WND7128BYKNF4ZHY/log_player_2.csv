"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. It's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $10,000. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this item, I'm only able to go up to $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but also that you are not willing to pay her asking price. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still too high. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further attempt to meet in the middle. It's still below Alice's price, but shows a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $10,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not confident I can get her to drop to my target price within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at my limit and avoid the risk of losing out altogether."
