"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to me while allowing us to both close a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
