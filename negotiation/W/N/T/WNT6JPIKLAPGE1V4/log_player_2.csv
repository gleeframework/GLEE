"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  Let's meet in the middle, this is a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still trying to get the product for as low a price as possible. Alice has come down, but you can still try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000. I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $9,000?  It's closer to what I can afford, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500 as a final offer.  Let's close this deal and both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. Accepting her final offer of $9,500 is a good deal for you, as it's still below your maximum budget of $8,000. While you could reject and try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice will be firm on her offer."
