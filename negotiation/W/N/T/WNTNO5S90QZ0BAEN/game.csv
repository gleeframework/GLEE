"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I see the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
