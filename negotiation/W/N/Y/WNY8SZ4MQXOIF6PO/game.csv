"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really interested in your product, but $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8625.0,Bob,4,
