Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $100, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer gives me a good starting point while still allowing me to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $85. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to my desired value.
* **John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  Offering $95 is a step closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. 
* **Maintain a firm stance:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and reinforces my position that $85 is too low.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By offering a slightly lower price, I demonstrate flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $95. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum willingness to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum desired price of $120. Accepting it would mean losing money on the deal.
* **One more counteroffer:** I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If Bob rejects that, I'll sell to John.
* **John is my backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get $92 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll receive.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last counteroffer.  I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm willing to settle for $92.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $92 is only $2 more than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Prepared to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
