"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $85. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $95. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum willingness to pay for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get $92 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll receive.  This is my final offer.",92.0,Alice,5,
