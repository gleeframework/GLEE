Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($120 from John), ensuring a good profit if Bob accepts."
