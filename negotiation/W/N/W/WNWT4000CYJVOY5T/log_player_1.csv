"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $95. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see where that gets me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $90? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal on a great product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $90. I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $82.5 is tempting, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I'm committed to getting the best possible price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $82.50.  How about we meet in the middle at $86? It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $86. I was thinking more along the lines of $82. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is only $2 less than what John is willing to pay. It's not a great deal, but it's a good deal considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with nothing. I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid any further risk."
