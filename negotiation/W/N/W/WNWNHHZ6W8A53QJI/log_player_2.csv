Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5

It's tempting to accept $125, but we're so close to our backup price. One more round might secure the best deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still a bit away from mine.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $121.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $121.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation to save $1. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
