"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll love it.

"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.
