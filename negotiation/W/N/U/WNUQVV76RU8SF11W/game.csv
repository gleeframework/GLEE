"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable item. I am interested in acquiring it, but I am working within a budget of $8,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm glad you've made a concession, but unfortunately, my budget remains at $8,000. I would like to propose a price closer to this amount. Would $10,000 be acceptable to you?",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,14000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is a fair price for this product. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer, but I still believe we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $11,500 be within your consideration?",11500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,13000.0
"I appreciate your willingness to consider my previous offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,,

"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,9,,
