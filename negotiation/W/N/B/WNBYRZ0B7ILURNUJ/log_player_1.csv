Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd be willing to sell to John for $120, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still net you a good profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives him the perception of a deal while ensuring you get a good return.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the ""special price"" to entice Bob."
