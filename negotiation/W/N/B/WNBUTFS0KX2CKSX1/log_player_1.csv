Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Respect Bob's Valuation:** Offering a price slightly below your minimum acknowledges that Bob won't pay significantly more than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message hints at flexibility and invites Bob to engage in discussions.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
