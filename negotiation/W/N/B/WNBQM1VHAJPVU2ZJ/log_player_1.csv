Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that the product is worth $120 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize that the product is valuable to Bob, which might make him more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or if I should make a counter-counteroffer.
* **If the negotiation stalls:** I have the option to sell to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, I am looking to spend less than $100 on this product. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $90 still provides me with a profit of $10 ($90 - $80). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price ($80). 
* **Time Value:**  It's better to secure a reasonable profit now than to risk losing out on the sale altogether. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, balancing profit with the potential for a lost sale."
