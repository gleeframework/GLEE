"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $95. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,6,
