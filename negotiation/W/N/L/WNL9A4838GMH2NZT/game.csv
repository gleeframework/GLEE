"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? That's still a great deal for a product worth $8,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
