Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $120. This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer if he wants to negotiate, but also ensures I get my minimum value for the product.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a compromise between my minimum price and his offer. It gives him a bit of a discount while still ensuring I get a decent amount of money."
