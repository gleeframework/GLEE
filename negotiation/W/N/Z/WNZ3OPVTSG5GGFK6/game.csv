"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a fair price. My initial offer is $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle on $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $8,000. How about we meet at $8,200? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm ready to close this deal today.  How about we split the difference and make it $8,100?",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $8,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,100 and my previous offer of $8,200. How about we settle on $8,150? This is the best I can do, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",8150.0,Alice,7,
