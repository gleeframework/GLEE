Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. Offering a price too close to Bob's valuation leaves potential profit on the table. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor near your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant returns"" aims to justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you're starting high, there's a small margin for negotiation if Bob pushes back.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different messages and prices within the ZOPA to see what works best.  Remember, understanding your counterpart's perspective and motivations is key to successful negotiation."
