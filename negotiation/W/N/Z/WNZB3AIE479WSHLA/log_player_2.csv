"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us - it's well below your estimated value and leaves me room to profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for negotiation and potentially securing a much better deal. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Phrasing the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle"" makes it seem like a fair compromise, even though it's significantly lower.
* **Leaving Buffer Room:** While $1,300,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves space to potentially increase the offer slightly in later rounds if necessary, while still staying well below the $1,500,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,375,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiating Leverage:** Alice moved closer to our offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. We still have room to bargain before hitting our $1,500,000 walk-away point.
* **Targeting Savings:** Accepting $1,375,000 is better than John's price, but we can aim for a larger discount by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Alice might not move much further, but the potential savings outweigh the chance of a slightly higher final price (as long as we stay below $1,500,000)."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $1,325,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're making smaller concessions now to signal we're getting closer to our limit, while still showing flexibility.
* **Meeting Halfway:** The offer of $1,325,000 splits the difference between the last two offers, presenting it as a fair compromise.
* **Pressure Point:** This price point puts pressure on Alice. It's a good deal for her compared to her value, and it's getting close to the point where we might walk away and go with John."
