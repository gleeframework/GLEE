"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price for this product anywhere else.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not serious about buying the product, I'd rather sell it to someone who is willing to pay a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,9,
