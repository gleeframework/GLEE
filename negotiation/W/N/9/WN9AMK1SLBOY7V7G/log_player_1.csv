"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a good starting point given Bob's value for the product. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm not giving it away for less than I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $13,000, which is closer to my desired price.  Although I might be able to get a bit more with more negotiation, I'm not sure I'll be able to get much higher.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
