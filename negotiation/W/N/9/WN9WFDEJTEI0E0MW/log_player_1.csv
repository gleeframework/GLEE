{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer gives me a decent profit ($1,500) while still leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of the product, which increases the chance of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum threshold, I can likely do better. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's likely I won't get a better price from him.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a profit of $750.  While I could try for a higher price, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer and ultimately selling to John for $8,000 outweighs the potential gain."
