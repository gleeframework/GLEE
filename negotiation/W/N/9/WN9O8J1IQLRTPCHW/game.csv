"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a limited time at the special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $90 is close, but I need to get at least $95 for it to make sense for me.  That's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
