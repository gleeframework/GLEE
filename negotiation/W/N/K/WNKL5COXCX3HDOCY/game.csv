"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still not able to meet at $110. I am prepared to pay up to $105 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",105.0,Bob,4,
