"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fair price. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,875. I think this price is fair to both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",12875.0,Bob,4,
