"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He has 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering gives him more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counter-offer close to Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000). This shows good faith and demonstrates that he is willing to negotiate seriously.  He also leaves room for further negotiation, making it likely that they can reach an agreement within the allotted rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $13,250 is better than her previous offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a better price.  He has 7 rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his desired price of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,875. I think this price is fair to both of us, and it's closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 12875}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but is offering a price that is closer to Alice's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
