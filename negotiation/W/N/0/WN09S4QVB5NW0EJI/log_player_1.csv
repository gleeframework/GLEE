"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it gives me a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,875. I think this price is fair to both of us, and it's closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,875 is getting closer to my desired range.  It's a better deal than selling to John for $12,000, and we're only a couple of rounds away from the end.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
