"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but  $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
