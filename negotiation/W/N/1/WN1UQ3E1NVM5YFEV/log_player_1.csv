Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"", Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering. 

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice is in a strong position. She knows she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so any amount above that is pure profit."
