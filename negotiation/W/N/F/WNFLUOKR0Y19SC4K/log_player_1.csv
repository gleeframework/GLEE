Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
