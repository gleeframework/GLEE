"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering we both have room to profit. Let's try to come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this time.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
