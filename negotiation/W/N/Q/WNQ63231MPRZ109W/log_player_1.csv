Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to discussion.** This encourages Bob to engage in negotiation rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **I'm not aiming for the full $12,000 right away.**  This ensures I have some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I need to try to push for a higher price.  

**My strategy:**

* **Reject Bob's offer.** This shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away.
* **Make a counteroffer in the next round.** I'll propose a price closer to my minimum, hoping to meet in the middle.
* **If necessary, I'll consider selling to John.**  This is a backup plan if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $8,500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:** $9,250 is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **The message is positive and encouraging:**  I emphasize a ""good deal"" for Bob and a ""compromise"" on my part. This creates a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **I'm still prepared to walk away:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, but I'm also ready to make one final counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $8750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.

**My strategy:**

* **Reject Bob's offer.** This shows I'm committed to getting closer to my desired price.
* **Make a final counteroffer in the next round.** I'll propose a price slightly higher than Bob's, but still lower than my minimum, hoping to secure a deal.
* **If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I'll sell to John.**  This is my absolute last resort, but it's better than selling for a price that's too low."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try one more time to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000.  It's a fair compromise that gives you a great deal on the product while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  $9,000 is my final offer. It's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer, but still below my minimum, indicating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  The message highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it seem like a win-win for both parties.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  The message implies that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or reject.

**If Bob rejects, I will sell to John for $12,000.**  I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm ready to walk away if necessary."
