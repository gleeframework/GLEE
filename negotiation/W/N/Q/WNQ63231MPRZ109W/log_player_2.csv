"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $8500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He can continue negotiating and try to get a price closer to his target of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try one more time to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9000.  It's a fair compromise that gives you a great deal on the product while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John, securing the product for $8,000. There's a chance Alice might come down further, but there's also a chance she won't, and Bob could end up spending even more than he'd like."
