"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $17,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we settle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad to hear you're getting closer to a comfortable price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, so I'm offering the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
