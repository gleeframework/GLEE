"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, so I'll counter with $1,012,500.  This would give you a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
