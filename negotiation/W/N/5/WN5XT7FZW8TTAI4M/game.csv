"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But I'm not comfortable going any lower than $100. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $120 to you. Let's close this deal at $100.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable paying $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?",98.0,Bob,6,
