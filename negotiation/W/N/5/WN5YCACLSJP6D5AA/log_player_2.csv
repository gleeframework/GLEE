"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be different for you. I'm willing to start at $95 for this round. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good starting point, Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He's willing to pay up to $80, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I would like to meet you halfway and propose a price of $90 for this round. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible and is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $80. While $90 is closer than Alice's first offer, it's still not within Bob's target range. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to lower my price to $87 for this round. This is my final offer before considering other options. Please let me know if this works for you or if you wish to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87 is close to Bob's budget, he is still trying to save as much money as possible.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before resorting to buying from John.  Bob may be able to convince Alice to drop the price just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $87 is getting close, but I'm still hoping to land at $85.  Is there any wiggle room at all?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $86 for the product. This is my final offer. I hope you'll find this satisfactory. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $85, Alice has come down to $86, which is only $1 above his maximum budget.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's a good deal considering his goal of saving money.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than to risk missing out on it."
