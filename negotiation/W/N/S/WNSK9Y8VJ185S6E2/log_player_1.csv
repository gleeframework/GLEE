Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. 

While I've come close to $90, I only have two rounds left and there's a risk that Bob will keep offering increasingly lower prices.  I don't want to lose out on the guaranteed $100 offer from John."
