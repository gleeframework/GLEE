"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at a price of $2,200,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample space for negotiation and potential concessions, increasing the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer serves as a gauge of Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for subsequent rounds.

By starting high, we aim to maximize our potential profit while leaving room for a strategic and potentially lucrative negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John is our safety net.  We'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is enticing, the value of this product for me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find common ground.
* **Anchoring:** While the price drop is substantial, we're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range, above Bob's offer but still allowing for movement.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to us reinforces its worth and provides a rationale for our counteroffer. 

We aim to strike a balance between showing willingness to negotiate and maintaining a firm stance on the product's value.  Bob's response will determine our next steps in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price.  While we could try to push for more in further rounds, there's a risk Bob will walk away. It's better to secure a sure deal at our minimum than risk losing the sale entirely."
