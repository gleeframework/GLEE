Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as much as possible from Bob without him rejecting the offer. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John.

Offering the product at $135 gives Bob a chance to gain a perceived value ($135 - $120 = $15) while still giving you a profit above your minimum. This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
