"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,500, but I'm not quite willing to go that low. I can do $9,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $9,250, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. How about $8,900?  It's a compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. I can do $9,400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details and finalize the sale.",9400.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $9,400. I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm open to exploring other options. I'd like to make one final offer: $9,200. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to consider other buyers.",9200.0,Alice,9,
