"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  How about $95?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  How about $90? I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower than that.",95.0,Alice,5,
