"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate. I'm also being positive and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm rejecting Bob's offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  How about $95?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  How about $90? I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my $100 minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 95}
