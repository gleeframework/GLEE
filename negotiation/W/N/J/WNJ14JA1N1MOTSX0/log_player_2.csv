"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum value of $120.  You can get the product for less from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
