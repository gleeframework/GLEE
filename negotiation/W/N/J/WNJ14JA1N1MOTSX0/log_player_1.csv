Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Backup Option:**  While you have John as a backup buyer, aiming for the higher price with Bob first is the optimal strategy."
