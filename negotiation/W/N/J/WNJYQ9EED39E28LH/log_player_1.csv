Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $200 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer. While $160 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $100. How about $90?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle at $100?  That would be a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go above his perceived value of $100.  You've already gone more than halfway from your initial offer, and it's clear Bob is trying to get the best possible deal for himself. Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price."
