We're getting closer, but $125 is still over our budget. We need to push Alice closer to our ideal price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle at $100?  That would be a great price for me."",

```

We're now at our limit. This offer is fair and leaves room for Alice to still make a profit."
