"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10000 is significantly lower than what I need to cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. Please let me know your thoughts.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17500 is still higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13000 is still quite a bit below my minimum requirement. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  If you're not able to go higher, I'll need to consider my other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
