Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
