"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're considering an initial offer of $14000. We believe this price reflects the quality and potential benefits of the product, while also allowing us to cover our costs and achieve a reasonable profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point, it makes sense to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $14,000 is above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This price allows for a fair margin for you and falls within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to adjust our offer based on your feedback. We're now proposing a price of $13500 for the product. This price aims to balance our needs for profitability while remaining competitive in light of your valuation. We hope this aligns better with your budget. Please let us know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer. However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. My final offer is $13,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin for you, while also staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair and realistic compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your persistence, Bob, and we've carefully considered your latest proposal. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, we would like to suggest a price of $13200 for the product. This price allows for a slightly higher profit margin for us while still being within your acceptable range. We believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us. Please let us know if this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While there's a chance that further negotiation could bring the price down, Bob has already rejected several offers and is approaching his limit of 10 rounds.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation delays or a potential stalemate."
