"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make it work within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good value for you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
