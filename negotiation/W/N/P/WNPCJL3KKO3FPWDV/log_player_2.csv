# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  That's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make it work within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was thinking of. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price of $8,000. You've already rejected a price of $8,500, so it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now back to a price point higher than the previous counteroffer you made ($9,000), and closer to her original asking price. This indicates that she's not willing to budge much further. At this point, you have a reliable alternative with John, who offers the product at your ideal price of $8,000.  It's no longer worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you could end up paying more."
