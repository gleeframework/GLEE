Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. This means any price Bob accepts above $150 is pure profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high ($149) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message includes a subtle nudge about ""value"" to potentially sway Bob's perception. 

It's important to note that while this is a strong starting point,  Bob's personality and negotiation skills could influence the final outcome."
