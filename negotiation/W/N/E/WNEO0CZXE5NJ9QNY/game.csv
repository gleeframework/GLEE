"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects a fair compromise and still allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and your initial offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,275,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off my target.  I'm willing to go down to $1,290,000. This is a final offer from me. If we can't find common ground here, I may have to explore other options.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
