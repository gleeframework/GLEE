Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is more than my minimum value, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer, and I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product."
