It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have room to go lower without risking going over your budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but still within my budget. It's important to be aggressive early on to see how far she's willing to come down."

Alice has come down a bit, but I still think we can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's latest price.  I want to show that I'm serious about buying the product while still trying to get a better deal.  We're getting close to a possible agreement, and I'm hoping Alice will meet me halfway."

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not ready to settle. We're almost there, and I'm confident we can reach a final price that works for both of us.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can strike a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,110,000}

I'm making a small increase from my last counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this is a fair price for both parties, and hopefully, Alice will finally accept. We're getting close to the end of our rounds, so I need to be prepared to finalize the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer, and we're running out of time.  It's better to close the deal now and save some money than risk going over budget with John.  I'm happy with this price, and it's a good outcome for both of us."
