"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $110 was still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
