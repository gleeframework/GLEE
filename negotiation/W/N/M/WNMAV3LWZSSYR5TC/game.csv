"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $800,000 for the product.  That way we can both walk away from this satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
