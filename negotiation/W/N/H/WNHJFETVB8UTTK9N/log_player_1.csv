Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly closer to your minimum. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving you with a lower final price or missing out on John's offer entirely.  It makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed offer from John at this point."
