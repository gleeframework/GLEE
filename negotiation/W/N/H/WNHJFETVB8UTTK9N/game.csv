"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm open to finding a compromise but need to see movement on your end. My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's finalize this deal and find common ground.",975000.0,Bob,6,
