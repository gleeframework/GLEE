"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price.  It's possible that with a counteroffer, he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is very close to my maximum budget, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1275000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $1290000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still outside of Bob's budget, even though it's a significant improvement.  At this point, Bob has exhausted his negotiating power and is likely to be stuck in a back-and-forth with Alice, potentially leading to a stalemate.  

It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees him the product within his budget and saves him the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
