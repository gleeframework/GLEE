Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a reasonable starting point.** It's higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **I'm aiming to get as much as possible.**  If Bob values the product highly, he might be willing to pay more.
* **If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup offer.**  This allows me to take a risk, knowing I won't lose out on my minimum value. 

**Important Note:** I'm providing this offer based on limited information.  A more strategic approach would require understanding:

* **The market for the product:**  Is it a common item or something unique?
* **Bob's financial situation:**  Can he afford a higher price?
* **Bob's negotiation style:**  Is he likely to counter-offer or accept the first offer? 

By gathering more information, I could potentially improve my offer and increase my chances of getting a higher price."
