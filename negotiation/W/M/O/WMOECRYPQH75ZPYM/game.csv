"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $8,800 to make this work. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that?",8400.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $8,600, but that's my absolute lowest. Let's close this deal, I think we're both close!",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,600. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is my absolute limit. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this final offer?",8000.0,Bob,6,
