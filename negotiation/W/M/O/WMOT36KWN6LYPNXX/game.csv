"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value at $15,000 to you, so I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reasonable. Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $11,500 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it.  Would you be willing to do $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
