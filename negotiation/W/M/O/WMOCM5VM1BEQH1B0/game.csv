"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $825000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $810000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer the product to you for $795000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on a price.",795000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting too far apart. I'm not willing to go any lower than $790000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. If you're still not comfortable with this price, I'm willing to walk away and explore other options.",790000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower than $790000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",780000.0,Bob,10,
