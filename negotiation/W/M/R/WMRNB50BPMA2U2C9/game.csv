"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
