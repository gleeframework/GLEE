``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a fair price that acknowledges Bob's potential value while leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm open to a deal, but not desperate to sell.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $1,050,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I can still make more money by negotiating further.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
