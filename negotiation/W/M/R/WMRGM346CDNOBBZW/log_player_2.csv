Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,065,000, which is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,060,000.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price."
