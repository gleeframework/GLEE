"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
