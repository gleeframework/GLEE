Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm asking for $1,190,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** By mentioning other interested parties, I increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
