"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  Let's close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $105, which is $95. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
