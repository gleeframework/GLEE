"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, and I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for cheaper.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $130, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $137.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $137.50 is closer to his target of $130, he can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit too high at $137.50.  How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go. Is that acceptable to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is very close to Bob's target price of $130, and it's likely that further negotiations will only yield a small reduction in price. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer or the possibility of having to buy from John for $150."
