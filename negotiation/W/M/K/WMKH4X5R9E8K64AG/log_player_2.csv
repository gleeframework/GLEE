"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than what you've assessed its value at ($120). However, I understand that everyone has their own valuation. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could meet both of our expectations? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.
