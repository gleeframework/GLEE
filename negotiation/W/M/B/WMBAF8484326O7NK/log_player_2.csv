"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds a significant value to me, and I believe it would greatly benefit you as well. Given its importance to both of us, I propose a fair transaction price of $12,000. This amount reflects the intrinsic value of the product while also ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I trust that this offer will be mutually beneficial and look forward to your positive response. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for considering this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John saves you $2,000 and ensures you stay within your $10,000 budget."
