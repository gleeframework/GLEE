"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.  Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1,050,000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This compromise reflects the value of the product and offers you a significant saving.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me, given the value of this product. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal while ensuring I can meet my own needs.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $1,087,500?",1087500.0,Bob,8,
