Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This gives Bob a small incentive to negotiate, but it's still a good starting point for me to make a profit. I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not risking much by offering a slightly higher price to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth that much to both of us. If Bob doesn't accept, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,190,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident that I can get a good price. If Bob doesn't accept, I can still sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,180,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I've had a few rounds of negotiations, and I'm not confident Bob will increase his offer much further.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a good profit."
