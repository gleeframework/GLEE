"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential for growth. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I see in it while still being fair to both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $937,500.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of this product and gives us both a good outcome.  Let's finalize this deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
