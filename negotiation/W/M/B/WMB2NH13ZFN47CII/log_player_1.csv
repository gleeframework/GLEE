Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential for growth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's potential. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I see in it while still being fair to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe Bob will be willing to go higher. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can always fall back to selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer.  However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not ready to accept.  He's clearly willing to negotiate, and I have more rounds to try and push for a higher price. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  $925,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $937,500.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of this product and gives us both a good outcome.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}
