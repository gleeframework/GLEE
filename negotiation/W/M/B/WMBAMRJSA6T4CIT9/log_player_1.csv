"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob thinks it's worth but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate but also leaves me with a decent profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, highlighting that he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation but not giving away too much right away.

I'm confident this offer will spark a conversation and hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a significant discount and leaves me some room to profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:**  I show Bob I'm listening by acknowledging his offer and his desire for a good deal.
* **Reasoning for the counteroffer:** I justify my counteroffer by highlighting the value he'll receive and the fact that it's a compromise.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I reiterate that I'm trying to find a solution that benefits both of us.

By being empathetic and offering a reasonable compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price. I'm not yet satisfied with this offer, and I believe I can push for a higher price with more negotiation. I have 6 rounds left, and I am not in a rush to accept an offer that leaves me with a significantly smaller profit margin than I initially hoped for."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too far below my target. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I am willing to negotiate by reducing my offer again, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making it clear that my offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this could be our final offer, encouraging Bob to consider accepting.

This counteroffer aims to find a point where Bob is happy with the price while still ensuring I can achieve a reasonable profit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet, as I have 4 rounds left and I believe I can still negotiate for a higher amount. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap between our prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough.  I'm holding out for a higher price because I have two rounds left and John is willing to pay significantly more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time, hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price. If he doesn't budge, I'll happily sell to John in the final round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10,825. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I will unfortunately have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 10825}
```

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your final offer of $10,825. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,775 for the product. I believe this price respects the value of the product to me while also allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my last chance to make a deal, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. It's not worth risking losing a significant amount of money to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John and secure a much higher profit."
