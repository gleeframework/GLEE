"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  It's worth much more than that to me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,250,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
