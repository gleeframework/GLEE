Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's keep working towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her down even further.  It's important to note that John's offer is still a viable option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before committing to that."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both get a good deal.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
