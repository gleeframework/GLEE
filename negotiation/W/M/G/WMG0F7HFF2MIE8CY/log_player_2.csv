"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it gives me a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He has several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further. Additionally, buying from John for $8,000 is still a better deal than accepting Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
