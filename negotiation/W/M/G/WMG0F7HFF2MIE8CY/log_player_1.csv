Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it gives me a good starting point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round and see if we can come to a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise and brings us closer to a deal.  I'm worried that if I continue to reject his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away, or I might run out of rounds and have to sell to John.  $9,000 is still a good profit, and it's better than potentially losing out on the sale altogether."
