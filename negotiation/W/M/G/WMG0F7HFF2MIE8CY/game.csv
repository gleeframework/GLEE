"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
