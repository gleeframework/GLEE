"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15000. Would you like to take a closer look and consider making an offer?",15000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not sure I can stretch much further than that. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget as far as you can, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. Can you consider that price?",10250.0,Bob,6,,
