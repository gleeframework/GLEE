"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
