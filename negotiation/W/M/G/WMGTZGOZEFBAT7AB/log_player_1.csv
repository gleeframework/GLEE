"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John is my backup option if negotiations fail to meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** Meeting Bob halfway demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding a strong position above both his offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reiterate Value:** By mentioning ""unique benefits,"" the message subtly reminds Bob why the product is worth a premium price.
* **Clear and Concise:** The offer is clear and easy for Bob to understand, facilitating a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This offer is closer to our respective values and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. However, there's still a significant gap between his offer and his perceived value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push for a higher price. Selling to John is becoming less appealing as Bob's offers increase, but it remains an option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value this product brings. To find common ground quickly, I'm willing to accept $1,090,000. This is a final offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and labeling it a ""final offer,"" I aim to nudge Bob towards a decision.  
* **Concession, but with a Limit:** I've made a small concession, showing flexibility, but the price is still strategically positioned to maximize my potential profit.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  The message emphasizes finding ""common ground quickly"" to steer the negotiation towards a successful close."
