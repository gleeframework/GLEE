"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This offer is closer to our respective values and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
