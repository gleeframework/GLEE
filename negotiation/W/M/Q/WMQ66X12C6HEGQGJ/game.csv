"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $900,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this price?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about making this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000,  which is a significant concession. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,6,
