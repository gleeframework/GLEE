Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value our potential partnership,  $900,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $925,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a bit closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about making this work.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000,  which is a significant concession. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I've been through several rounds with Bob and it seems we can't reach an agreeable price.  It's time to move on and sell to John. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, ensuring the sale is more important."
