"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm not willing to settle for $110 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $112.  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm not willing to settle for $108 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. I've lowered my price a bit more, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than selling to John.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone on for several rounds, and the price keeps dropping.  Bob is clearly trying to get the best deal for himself, and I'm not sure I can push him higher. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he might drop his offer further or even stop negotiating.  It's better to be safe than sorry. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
