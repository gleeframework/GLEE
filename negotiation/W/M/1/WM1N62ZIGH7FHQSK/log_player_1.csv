Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 118} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $118, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems stubborn at this point and I'm not sure we'll agree on a price that satisfies me.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option right now to ensure I meet my minimum desired price."
