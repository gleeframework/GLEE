Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  You don't know if he'd be willing to pay more, but logically, he won't want to pay *significantly* more. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to maximize your potential profit but not so high that you scare Bob off.  

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're framing this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a touch of desirability.
* **Justifying the Price:** You're vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" without revealing specifics. This aims to make Bob think harder about what he might be missing.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $150,000 markup gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counters. You can always come down a bit, especially knowing you have John's offer as a safety net. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will dictate your next move. If he accepts, great! If he rejects or counteroffers, you'll need to adjust your strategy.
* **Confidence is Key:**  Present your offer with confidence.  Even if you feel a little nervous about the high price, don't let it show!"
