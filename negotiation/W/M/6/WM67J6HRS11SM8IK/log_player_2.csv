"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value the product holds for you, and I'd like to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $14,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price of $12,000. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a good middle ground. This allows you to make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget. Let's try to reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that since we're so close to the product's value to you, I could make one more concession. My revised offer is $13,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and it brings me closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above his maximum budget of $12,000. Even though it's a good deal, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 5 rounds left, so it's worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $13,500 is a great offer. However, I'm hoping we can bridge the gap just a little further. If you're willing to come down to $13,000, we can finalize the deal. This would ensure a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
