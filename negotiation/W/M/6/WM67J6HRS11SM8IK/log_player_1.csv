Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,000, which is a good middle ground. This allows you to make a profit while I can acquire the product within my budget. Let's try to reach a deal at this price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that since we're so close to the product's value to you, I could make one more concession. My revised offer is $13,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and it brings me closer to my minimum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $13,500 is a great offer. However, I'm hoping we can bridge the gap just a little further. If you're willing to come down to $13,000, we can finalize the deal. This would ensure a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to acquire the product within my budget.
