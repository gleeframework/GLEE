"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget constraints. After careful consideration, we would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $1,250,000 for the product. This price aims to provide a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive with your valuation. We believe this could be a win-win situation for both parties involved.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
