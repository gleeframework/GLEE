"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
