"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

However, considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm not comfortable going below $875,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875,000.
