Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller.  At this stage, it's unlikely Bob will meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer from Bob, but the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of him dropping out altogether. Accepting John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further time spent negotiating."
