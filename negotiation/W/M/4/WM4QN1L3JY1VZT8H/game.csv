"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. That's a significant discount from my initial price and closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,5,
