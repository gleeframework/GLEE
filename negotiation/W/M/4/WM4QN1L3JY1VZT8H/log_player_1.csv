Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open and engaging Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a better price by countering Bob's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $15,000 is tempting, it's crucial to explore all options before making a final decision. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round with the goal of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,000, which is a significant increase from his offer but still lower than my initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Open-Ended Approach:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter again if he needs to, keeping the negotiation ongoing.

This counteroffer aims to balance my desire for a higher price with the need to potentially close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  The difference between his offer and my minimum is now quite small. Further negotiation might not yield a significant improvement.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is much more attractive,  it's worth exploring one more counteroffer with Bob to see if we can bridge the gap. 

I will make one final counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects it, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. That's a significant discount from my initial price and closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Clear Intent:** The message emphasizes that this is a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""significant discount"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal with Bob, but if he rejects, I'll move forward with John's offer."
