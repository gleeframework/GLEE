"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate the price, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, $950000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're really close, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to meet me in the middle. However, $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product to you for $1050000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $1000000, Bob. I think this is a great opportunity for us to finalize the deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
