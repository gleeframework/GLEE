"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,250 secures a good deal for Bob, saving him $1,750 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away and missing out on both offers."
