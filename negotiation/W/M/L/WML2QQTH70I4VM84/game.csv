"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $10,500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's compromise at $11,000. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",11750.0,Alice,5,
