"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the value to Bob, hoping to capture some of the potential surplus. This also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. There's still room for negotiation and I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This leaves some room for both of us to gain from the deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $825000 is a bit high. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd like to suggest $800000 as a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I've reached a point where I'm comfortable accepting the deal and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
