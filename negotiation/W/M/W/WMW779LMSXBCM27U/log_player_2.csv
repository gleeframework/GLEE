"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details, I can say it's something unique and potentially very lucrative. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find the value to be worth the investment.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John. While the details of the product are unknown, the potential for a ""unique and potentially very lucrative"" product makes it a worthwhile risk for Bob."
