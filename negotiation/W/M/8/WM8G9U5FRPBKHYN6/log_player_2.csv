Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,250? I think this is the best compromise we can reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems pretty firm on her price. Accepting at $10,250 is a reasonable deal, saving me almost $5000 compared to John's offer.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk the negotiation breaking down."
