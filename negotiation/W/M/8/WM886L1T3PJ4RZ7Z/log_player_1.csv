"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My starting price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $650,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still better than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* There is also the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which gives me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $650,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also giving you a great deal. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a meeting point."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and can likely get a better price. 
* I'm still not in a desperate situation, and I can always sell to John for $1,200,000.
* I'm confident I can find a more advantageous deal within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $787,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 787500}
