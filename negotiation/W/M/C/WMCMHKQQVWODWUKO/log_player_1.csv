Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired value without losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer will secure a sale above my minimum, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get me any closer to my desired value."
