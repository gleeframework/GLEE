"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, aiming to find a compromise closer to Bob's desired price point. It leaves room for further negotiation, but it also demonstrates Bob's serious interest in the product while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer to his desired price, Bob can get the product for his exact budget from John.  Therefore, buying from John is the most beneficial decision for Bob."
