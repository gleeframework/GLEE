Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $9,250?  I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,250. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,100. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100

``` 
While I could push for a bit more, accepting $9,100 is a good deal. Bob is clearly interested and this price exceeds my minimum.  It's better to secure a good profit now than risk losing the sale.
