"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $1400000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving more money.  The option to buy from John for $1,200,000 is always available, providing a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential value to my business. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's value to me.  I believe this is a good starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1325000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price of $1,200,000. The option to buy from John is still a safety net if the negotiations with Alice break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,325,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to securing this product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $1285000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,285,000 is closer to Bob's target price of $1,200,000, but it's still above his maximum budget.  However, with only 5 rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue trying to negotiate a lower price. The option to buy from John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, but it's still preferable to try and secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $1,285,000 is getting very close to what I can afford. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,275,000.

Let's work together to bridge this small gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my desired price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1275000. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $1270000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is only $70,000 above Bob's target price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. With only 3 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000. The option to buy from John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, but it's still preferable to try and secure a lower price from Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise and your understanding of my budget. To finalize this deal and avoid going to John, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer and reflects my commitment to acquiring this product. This is my final offer, and I sincerely hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1250000. Considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $1260000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. If this offer is not acceptable, I will need to consider selling the product to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,260,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. With only one round remaining, Bob has very little leverage to negotiate further. To avoid risking losing the product completely, Bob should take the safe option and purchase the product from John for $1,200,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the possibility of a higher price from Alice."
