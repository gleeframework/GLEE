"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" of the product, you provide a reason for the high initial price without revealing its true value to you.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  It's crucial to appear flexible and open to discussion. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum and what John is willing to pay. You have room to negotiate and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the product's value to you. However, my current asking price needs to be closer to $1,450,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are making a significant step down from your initial offer but still staying comfortably above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the ""true worth,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value without directly dismissing his perception.
* **Open for Discussion:** The tone remains collaborative and encourages Bob to respond with his thoughts.  You're aiming to find a middle ground that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered the product's value to me and am willing to offer $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time Value:**  While you could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate means potentially losing out on a guaranteed $1,300,000. While John offers your minimum, the difference in profit is substantial enough to accept Bob's offer."
