"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I think is a fair and competitive offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I do see value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you see value in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I understand this is your bottom line, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too far out of my budget.  To be honest, I can get this for $1,000,000 elsewhere, but I'd much rather work with you. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you'd prefer to work with me. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to budge, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic with my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a very serious offer and as I mentioned, I can go elsewhere for $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about the offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a commitment. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $975,000, which would be $1,000,000. I'm willing to accept this price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the price John is offering me. Let's finalize the deal at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
