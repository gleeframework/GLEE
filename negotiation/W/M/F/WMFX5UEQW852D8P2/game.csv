"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation. My final offer is $980,000.",980000.0,Alice,5,
