"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's more profitable for me to explore other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: $13,500. This is my final counteroffer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
