"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to Alice, so she is likely to make a profit of $30 if I accept her offer. However, I can get the same product from John for $80, which is a much better deal for me.
