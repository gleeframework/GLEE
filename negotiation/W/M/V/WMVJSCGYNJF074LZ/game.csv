"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $101? That's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",101.0,Alice,5,
