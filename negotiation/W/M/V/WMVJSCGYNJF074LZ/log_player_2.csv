Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 97
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $101? That's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John for $100 than to risk the negotiation failing and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
