"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1250000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. That's the highest I can go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $1200000, which is the minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
