Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance Bob will accept this price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price provides a buffer for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The message subtly hints at other interested buyers (John) to create a sense of urgency without revealing the exact backup offer."
