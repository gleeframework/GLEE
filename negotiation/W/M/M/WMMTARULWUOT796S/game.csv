,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider it?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? It's still a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider it?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than $130.  Let's try $135.  That's a good compromise and would still make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal. I'm willing to go up to $132, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",132.0,Bob,6,
