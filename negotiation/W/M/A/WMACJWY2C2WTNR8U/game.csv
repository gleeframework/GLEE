,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product but I can only go up to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious, but $12,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Could you do $17,000?  That would make this worth my while.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000?  That's the absolute maximum I can do.",15000.0,Bob,4,
