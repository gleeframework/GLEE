Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum, but I'm still open to negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70. It's below my minimum threshold of $80. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85.  It's a compromise,  above Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price.  This shows I'm open to negotiation, while also ensuring I get at least a bit more than my minimum."
