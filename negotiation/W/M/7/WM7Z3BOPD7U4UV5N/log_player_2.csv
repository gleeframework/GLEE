"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so you should aim to pay less than that. Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is too high. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for you, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more time spent and potential for Alice to get frustrated and walk away.  Accepting her offer is the most efficient way to acquire the product at a reasonable price."
