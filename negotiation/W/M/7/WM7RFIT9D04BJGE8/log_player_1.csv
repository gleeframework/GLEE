Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a profitable deal.  I'm confident John will be waiting in the wings if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's still better than selling to John right now. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for something closer to my desired price of $1,500,000, but I'll also consider the risk of losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  I believe this price is fair, considering both our desired values. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not willing to go any lower. The risk of going through multiple more rounds with him is not worth it. While $1,500,000 is less than what I initially wanted, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity."
