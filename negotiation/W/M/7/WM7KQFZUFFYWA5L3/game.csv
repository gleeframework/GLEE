"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it falls short of reflecting the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,025,000?",2025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle again?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen to reach an agreement that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,962,500? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1962500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,962,500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,950,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can we meet at this price?",1950000.0,Bob,6,
