"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly better price point. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a better price. However, I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle again at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $920,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
