"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I have several rounds left and I believe I can push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and hopefully secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I have in mind, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is closer to my ideal price, I can still potentially do better.  I have 5 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that considers both of our needs and positions us for a successful transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. Let's make it happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is offering $1,070,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,060,000.  We've made significant progress in the negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price changes.  Accepting the offer ensures that I secure the product at a reasonable price while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation or having to purchase from John at a much higher price."
