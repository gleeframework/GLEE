"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $1500000. Can you consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
