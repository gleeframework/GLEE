This product offers significant value, and to make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $1,050,000.  I'm confident that at this price point, it would be an excellent investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.
