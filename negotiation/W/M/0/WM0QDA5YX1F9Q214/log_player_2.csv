"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth considering a price of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $12,000 is less than $15,000. 
* **It's within your budget:** $12,000 is less than your $15,000 limit. 

Even though Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to her, it's still a better deal for you than buying from John."
