"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for more. Bob has shown interest and recognizes the product's value.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking for something closer to $12,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I believe $12,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise and is significantly higher than what John is offering. It's important to balance the potential for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
