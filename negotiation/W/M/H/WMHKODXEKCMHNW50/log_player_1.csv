{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's value, but below my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, so I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can still get closer to my target of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $97.50 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $96, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation with Bob isn't going to get me much closer to my target price of $120. I've already made several concessions, and Bob's offer of $96 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. It's time to move on and sell the product to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
