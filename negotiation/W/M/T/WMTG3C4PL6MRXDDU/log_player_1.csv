Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport with Bob and make him feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $7,500 is below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm not desperate to sell and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer. Let's try $8,200.  That's only $200 more than your last offer, and it's still below my initial asking price.  I'm confident it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum, and I can always try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the future if I have time."
