"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good price for you and a good deal for me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  How about $12,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
