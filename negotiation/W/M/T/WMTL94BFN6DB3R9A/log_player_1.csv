{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still allows for a good profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" reminds Bob I have other options if he declines, increasing the perceived value and encouraging a quicker decision."
