Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, it's always good to start negotiations higher than his perceived value and significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $120 offers a potential win-win. Bob gets the product for less than you value it, and you make a profit significantly more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Having a Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's offer allows you to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
