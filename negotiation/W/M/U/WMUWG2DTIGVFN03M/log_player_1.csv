Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Opening high:**  Starting with a higher price allows for more negotiation space.
* **Focus on value:** Emphasizing the benefits for Bob increases the chances of him accepting or making a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but also have a fallback option with John, ensuring I won't be pressured to sell for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).** Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** I am confident that I can get a better price, considering John's willingness to pay $150.  
* **Continuing the negotiation with Bob keeps open the possibility of a higher price.**

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $120, but lower than my initial offer of $175. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $155, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $155, which is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and expressing my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise that shows my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $155 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Building momentum:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for an unreasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $140 as a counteroffer. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.** While I would prefer to sell for more, it's important to consider that John is willing to pay $150. This means that if I reject Bob's offer, I might end up selling to John at the same price after further negotiation.
* **Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.**  There's a chance that continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate or a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk assessment:**  The potential gains of further negotiation are outweighed by the potential risk of losing the sale to Bob or ending up with the same price as John's offer.
* **Maximizing profit:**  While $140 isn't ideal, it's still a profitable sale that avoids potential delays and uncertainties.

**Next Steps:**

I will move forward with the sale to Bob and finalize the transaction."
