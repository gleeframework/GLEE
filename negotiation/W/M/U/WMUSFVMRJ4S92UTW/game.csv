"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I find the current price a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair value for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing the market value and the product's potential, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and is still a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth and is a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
