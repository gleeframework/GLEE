Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I'm confident the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so this gives me some room to negotiate down.
* **It sets the tone:**  A high initial offer suggests I believe the product is valuable and I'm not afraid to push for a good price.

I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
