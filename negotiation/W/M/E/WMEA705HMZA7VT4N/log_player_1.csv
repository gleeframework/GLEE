"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a high price, but it's a valuable asset that's worth a lot to me. I'm confident you'll see the value in it."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential earnings. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, hoping to get Bob to consider it's worth more than his initial assessment.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the offer can help sway Bob.

**Note:** While this is a high opening price, it's still a significant discount from my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. This strategy allows me to explore potential gains while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. I am willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $2,000,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my minimum price by counter-offering.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to my initial price.  While his offer is more reasonable than the initial one, I'm still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my asking value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This would still allow me to make a decent profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both of us can find some benefit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting to negotiate down from my initial price but remaining above my minimum threshold.  This will allow me to gauge if Bob is willing to meet my minimum price without having to sell to John. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely need to make another counter-offer to determine if a deal is possible with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can still negotiate further. I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000 but it's still below it. I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value.  Even selling to John would be a better option than accepting this offer at this point.  

I will counter-offer again to see if I can get a price closer to my minimum threshold or even better.  If Bob continues to refuse, I will likely have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price.  However, I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it's the closest I can get while still making sure I'm not losing money on this deal. Let's see if we can finally find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that is just above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still showing flexibility. 
* **Concession:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a concession on my part to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Finality:** I'm hinting at the possibility that this might be my final offer, adding a sense of urgency to Bob's decision. 

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely have to sell to John.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,500,000.
*  I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, so I'm making this counter-offer my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's a reasonable offer and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal by rejecting it.   I can't get a better price from John at this moment. 

Since we've reached an agreement, it's time to accept the offer and move forward with the transaction."
