"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and make it $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,250 is still not quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000.  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
