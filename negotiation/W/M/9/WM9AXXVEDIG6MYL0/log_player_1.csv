Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $8,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a significant difference between our minimum and Bob's maximum. This allows for some negotiation.
* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle of the range to leave room for a potential compromise. 

**Strategy:**

* **First Offer High:**  I'm hoping to secure a higher price in the initial stages, leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:**  Having John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net means I don't have to accept unreasonable counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** $10,000 is still below my ideal price point, but it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Value:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John is an option, it's not the best outcome. I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise between our desired prices. 
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm still willing to consider selling to John if further negotiations with Bob fail, but I'm optimistic that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My initial offer of $12,000 was rejected, and Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is too low.  A counteroffer of $11,000 represents a compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value to Bob:** The product is still worth $15,000 to Bob, so $11,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Minimizing Risk:** This offer allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my initial goal while still avoiding selling to John for $8,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate.
* **Signal Flexibility:** By reducing my initial offer, I'm signaling that I'm open to compromise while still holding firm on my desire for a reasonable price."
