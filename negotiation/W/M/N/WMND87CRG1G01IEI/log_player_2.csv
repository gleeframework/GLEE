"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd save more by rejecting and buying from John,  Alice's price ($14,000) is still within your budget of $15,000.
* **You gain from Alice's offer.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is only asking for $14,000.  This means you're saving $1,000 compared to your maximum willingness to pay."
