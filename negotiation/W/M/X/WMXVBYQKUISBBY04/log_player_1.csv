Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell for less.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering a higher price gives me a chance to earn more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject, but the potential reward of a higher sale price justifies the risk. 

Let's see if Bob's willing to pay a premium!"
