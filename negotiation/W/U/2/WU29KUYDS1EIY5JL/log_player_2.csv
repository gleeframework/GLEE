"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John wants $1,000,000. 
* **You are still getting a good deal:**  You value the product at $1,000,000, and you're getting it for $100,000 less."
