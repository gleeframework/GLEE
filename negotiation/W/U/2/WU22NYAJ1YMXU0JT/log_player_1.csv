Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a price higher than what Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher than Bob's initial assessment, potentially making him more open to a price above $10,000. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $19,000 is ambitious, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately turn Bob away. He might try to negotiate down, giving me the chance to still land a sale above my minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If I knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, I might start lower. However, without that knowledge, a higher starting point is strategically sound.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If I was in a rush to sell, I might lower the price to ensure a quicker sale. But with John as a backup, I have more leverage."
