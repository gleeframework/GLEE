"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about this deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $1,025,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to the table.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really pushing hard for this deal, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we aim for $1,075,000? It's a small increment, but I think it's worth it for a product of this caliber.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm feeling like we're not making much progress. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,010,000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, even if it means sacrificing some convenience.",1010000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're feeling the pressure, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. If not, I'm afraid we'll have to part ways.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
