"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm thinking of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
