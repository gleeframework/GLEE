"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $950,000 is too far below my minimum threshold. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $1,050,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm thinking of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I am still confident that I could get a higher price from Bob, time is running out and I want to ensure I get a decent price.  Since Jhon is offering $1,000,000, I'm going to go ahead and sell to him.  It's a safe bet, and it will get me out of the potentially lengthy negotiations with Bob."
