"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's only fair to present this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $11,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, we propose a price of $13,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $13,000 is getting closer to his maximum budget, he can still get the product for less from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We're glad to meet you halfway. Our latest proposal is to offer the product for $12,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to his price range, he can buy the same product from John for a lower price. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point, as he's already secured a better deal."
