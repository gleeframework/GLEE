Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can't go below $101.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's unlikely to go below $100.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
