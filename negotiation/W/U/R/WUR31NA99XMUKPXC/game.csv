,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this time. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a compromise between our initial offers.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This represents a significant move from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our individual valuations. Let's see if we can find a meeting point.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad to see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
