Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible deal.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in this product and how much he values it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price of $1,750,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves room for profit and is closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see any room for further negotiation, and John is offering the same amount. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and move on."
