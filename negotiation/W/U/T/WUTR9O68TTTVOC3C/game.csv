"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000? That would be a price point I'm much more comfortable with.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $675,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 was still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $685,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",685000.0,Alice,5,
