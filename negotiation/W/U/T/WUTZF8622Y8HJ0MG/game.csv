"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $82.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet at $80? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it would be a fair price considering the product's value.",80.0,Alice,5,
