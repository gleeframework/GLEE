"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $8000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
