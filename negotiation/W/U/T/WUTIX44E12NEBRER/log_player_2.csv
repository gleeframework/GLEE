"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount.  He's offering $2,500 less than Alice's initial price, which is a substantial reduction.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price of $8,000. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay under $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while still showing willingness to compromise.  By offering $8,500, he's signaling that he's serious about making a deal but isn't willing to go above his maximum budget."
