"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $125. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your guaranteed better deal."
