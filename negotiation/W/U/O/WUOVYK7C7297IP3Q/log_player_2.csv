"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $500,000 is a good starting point. However, it's likely that Alice is willing to sell for a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. This strategy is based on the assumption that Alice is willing to negotiate and wants to sell the product.  A lower counteroffer increases the chances of Alice accepting, but also leaves more room for negotiation if she rejects.  

I'll adjust my counteroffer based on Alice's responses, moving closer to her initial offer or toward John's price if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $400,000 is significantly lower than John's price, it's still above my initial counteroffer. This suggests she is willing to negotiate further. Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial $300,000 goal.  I can also adjust my counteroffer based on her response, gradually increasing it if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but is also firm on a price higher than my initial counteroffer.  I'm increasing my offer to $350,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and her latest one. This signals my desire to continue negotiating while demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $450,000. This is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to pay closer to my initial target of $300,000,  Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and further attempts may not lead to a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product at a substantial discount without the risk of further negotiation falling through."
