{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm setting the price significantly lower than my value ($1,500,000) but high enough to still yield a substantial profit. This creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy, as he gains $400,000 in value ($1,400,000 price vs. his $1,000,000 valuation).

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal and maximizing potential earnings."
