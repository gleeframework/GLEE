"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is above your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering me. However, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've started with a significant counteroffer, reducing the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I have a firm budget. It leaves room for further negotiation but signals my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $900,000 is still outside my desired price range.  I have several rounds left and the potential to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by making a smaller counteroffer than before, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is a reasonable midpoint between our current positions and gives Alice room to accept without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is close enough to my budget that accepting is the best course of action.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running the risk of Alice becoming too stubborn or the deal falling through completely.  Furthermore, buying from John would only save me $85,000, which is not a significant enough difference to justify the risk of losing this deal."
