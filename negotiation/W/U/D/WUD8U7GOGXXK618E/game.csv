"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
