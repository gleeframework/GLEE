"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $10200. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $10,200 is still above my budget of $8,000. While I'm open to negotiating, we're getting close to my limit. Considering the time constraint of 10 rounds and Alice's reluctance to go lower, it's more sensible to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
