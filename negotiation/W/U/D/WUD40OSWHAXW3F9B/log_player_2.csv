Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,200,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and I'm hoping she'll see it as a starting point for a more reasonable negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my target price.  There's still room for a counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is still below my maximum budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise.  If she rejects my counteroffer, I can always resort to buying from John as a last resort."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going all in with my final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I'm hoping that Alice recognizes the value of closing the deal and accepts this final offer. If she rejects it, I'll be forced to purchase from John, but I've done everything I can to secure the best possible price from Alice."
