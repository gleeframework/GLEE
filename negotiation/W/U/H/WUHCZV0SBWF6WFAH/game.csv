"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a strong investment.  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I need to be sure I'm getting fair value for this unique product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good compromise.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm looking for a good deal, but I also need to be responsible with my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,090,000, so I'll offer $1,045,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1045000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000, which is closer to your offer, but I really need to get at least this much to make this deal work.  It's important to remember that this product is worth significantly more to you, and this is a price that reflects that.  Is this something you can work with?",1060000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, which is my absolute maximum. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
