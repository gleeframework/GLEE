"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, even if it's unlikely she'll come down to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should reject and try to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice will come down more, especially since she already rejected Bob's counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that Bob can always buy from John for $12,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $14,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. At this point, Alice has shown that she's not willing to budge much further, and she's only offered $15,000, which is still above Bob's budget. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Alice when he can get the product for his desired price from John."
