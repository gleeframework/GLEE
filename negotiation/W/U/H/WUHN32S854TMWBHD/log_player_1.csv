"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can do better by continuing negotiations with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, given the value this product holds for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while still being within my range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $950,000, so I'm offering $875,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is an improvement, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is closer to your last offer, but still reflects the significant value you'll gain from this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $925,000, so I'm offering $862,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiation is getting tiresome, and Bob's offers are still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my financial goals and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price."
