# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this offer is a good compromise saving $75,000 compared to John's price."
