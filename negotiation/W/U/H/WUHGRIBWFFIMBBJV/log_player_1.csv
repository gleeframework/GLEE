{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential for a good deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing us to potentially secure a price even closer to $1,500,000. 

By setting the initial price high, Alice demonstrates the product's value while leaving the door open for negotiation with Bob."
