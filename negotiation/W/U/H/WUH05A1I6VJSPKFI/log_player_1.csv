Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be of great value to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $120, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80). Offering it at $100 allows you to potentially earn a $20 profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the $100 offer isn't excessively high. It leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downward, still keeping you above your minimum.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John. Offering it to Bob at $100 first gives you a chance to earn more before taking the guaranteed offer."
