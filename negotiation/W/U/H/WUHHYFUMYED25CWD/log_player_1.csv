Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, incorporating negotiation tactics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire a unique asset. It's something I value highly, but I recognize its potential value to you could be even greater. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this presents a fair and mutually beneficial opportunity. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but not greedy:**  Aiming for $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) while leaving Bob with a potential gain ($50,000). This encourages him to accept rather than risk losing out.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests willingness to discuss. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher final price.
* **Value-based language:** Phrases like ""unique asset"" and ""potential value to you"" emphasize the product's worth, subtly justifying the high price."
