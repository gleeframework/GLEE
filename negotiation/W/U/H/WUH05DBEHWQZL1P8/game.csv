"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair given my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That reflects the product's true value.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering both our perspectives.",11000.0,Bob,4,
