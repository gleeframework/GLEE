"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than $10,000. How about we discuss $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is closer to my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
