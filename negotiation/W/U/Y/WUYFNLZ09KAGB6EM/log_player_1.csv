Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible while ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Our Safety Net:** We have John willing to pay $150, our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product significantly above Bob's valuation ($140) leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter-offer) while still aiming for a price much higher than our minimum. 

The message aims to be enticing without revealing our minimum price, focusing on value to encourage Bob to accept."
