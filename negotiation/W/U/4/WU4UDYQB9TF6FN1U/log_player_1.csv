Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's thoughts and potential counter-offer, leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a deal."
