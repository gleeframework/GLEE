"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $100, which is still within your budget. Since Alice's offer is $90, it's better to reject and buy from John to save $10."
