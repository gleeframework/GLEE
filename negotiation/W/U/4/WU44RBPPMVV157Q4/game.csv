"I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target of $8000. Can you consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my target of $8000, so I'll offer $10000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",10000.0,Bob,6,
