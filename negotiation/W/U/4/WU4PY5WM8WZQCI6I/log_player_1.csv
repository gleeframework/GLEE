Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is my final offer.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, his ""final offer"" is still significantly below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
