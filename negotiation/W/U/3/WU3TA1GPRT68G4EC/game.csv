"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product provides substantial value, and I believe a fairer price would be $1,600,000.  This still allows you to benefit from a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a significant price, but I'm willing to meet you there.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,450,000?  This represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch a bit further, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high. How about $1,300,000?  That's my final offer, as I know I can get it for $1,200,000 elsewhere. I'd rather work with you, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
