```

* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer is a starting point. I'm willing to negotiate and see if I can find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm keeping my ""Plan B"" in mind (selling to John for $15,000) if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
