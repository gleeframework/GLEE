"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the product for closer to his target of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'm offering you the product for $10,850. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Alice's offer of $10,850 is only $850 more than Bob's target of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the next offer and he'll be stuck with a higher price or forced to buy from John.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still keeping his costs relatively low.  

Bob should accept the offer to secure the product without risking a stalemate or a higher price."
