"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $10,000 to both of us. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $8,500.  Reject the offer and see what counteroffer Alice makes."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $7,500. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $8,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice has come down to $8,000, which is a good price for you.  It's worth accepting her offer rather than risking further negotiations or paying the full $10,000 to John."
