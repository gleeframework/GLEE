I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold opening, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is truly interested.  If he's willing to pay that much, great! If not, we can work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer and still well above my minimum. I'm ready to accept and move forward with the sale."
