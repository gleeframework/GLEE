Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value of this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
