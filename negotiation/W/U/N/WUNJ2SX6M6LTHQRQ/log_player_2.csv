"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, which I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's likely a price point where both parties can benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  At $10,500, Bob is still saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small savings, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay the full $12,000 to John is too high.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this point."
