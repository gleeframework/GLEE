"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
