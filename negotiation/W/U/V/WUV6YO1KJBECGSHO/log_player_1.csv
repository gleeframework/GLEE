Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, hoping Bob is willing to pay it. If not, we can negotiate further. However, I also have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up my profit margin just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This should be a good compromise for Bob, and if he rejects it, I might be willing to come down a bit further. But I won't go below $110, as John is still a viable option."
