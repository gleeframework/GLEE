# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
