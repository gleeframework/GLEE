"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. My asking price is $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($1,500,000), and while it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,375,000.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
