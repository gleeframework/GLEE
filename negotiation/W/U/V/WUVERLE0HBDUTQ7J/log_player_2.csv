"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $140 is still more than you're willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $137.50 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While $137.5 is closer to your target, you can still try to get a lower price.  Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your goal of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $135.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $138. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. You're very close to your goal of $130, and it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether to try and squeeze out another few dollars."
