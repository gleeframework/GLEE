"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within your budget. However, you know you can potentially get it for less. You want to explore the negotiation further and see if you can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to offer $750,000.  This is a significant discount for you and a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, significantly lowering the price. It's a risk, but it's also a chance to potentially get a great deal. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is still a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price.  You want to see if you can push for a lower price. While the offer is closer to your target, it is still within your budget, so it's not an immediate ""must-buy"" situation.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $800,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate but still firmly believe the product is worth less than her asking price. It also gives you some room to potentially negotiate down further in the coming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $815,000 is a good price, it's still above your target.  You have several rounds left, and the price has been moving in your favor.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you have a chance to secure a lower price and save more money. Even if Alice rejects, you might be able to get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $815,000. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we agree on $805,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer but still below Alice's current price. It demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway while still pushing for a better deal. It also signals to Alice that you are serious about buying the product but have a firm price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge much more from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $812500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's also indicating that this is her final offer. At this point, you've already brought the price down significantly, and you're approaching the end of the negotiation. While $812,500 isn't your ideal price, it's still a good deal and well within your budget. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, especially since you have an alternative option with John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and saves you valuable time and potential risks associated with further negotiation."
