"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to potentially get a price closer to my maximum limit."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offers, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, as I'm unsure if she'll continue to lower her price.  It's better to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure I stay within my budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
