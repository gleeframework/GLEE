"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you and only $8,000 to me.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering you're getting more than what it's worth to me and it's closer to my budget.  I hope you'll consider my counteroffer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
