I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, given that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept it, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $1,200,000. While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth this amount to him, and I'm not willing to sell for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get closer to my asking price, and I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm willing to compromise slightly to get this deal done, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for both of us. I'm offering $1,175,000, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

Bob is not willing to meet my price. I've made several concessions and it seems like he's not going to budge. I've reached my limit, and I'm not comfortable going lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a known value than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
