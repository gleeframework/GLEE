"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer at $120. I can get the product from John for $80, so I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price from her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know if you're willing to work with that."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still too high. While $100 is better than her initial offer, I can still get the product from John for $80. I'll reject her offer and try to get her down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my budget. I can still get the product from John for $80, so I'll reject Alice's offer and try to see if she'll come down further."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to come down to my price, and I've already made several counteroffers. I've reached my limit in terms of what I'm willing to pay, and it's becoming clear that Alice isn't going to budge.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John for $80."
