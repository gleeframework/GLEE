"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $11,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little too high for me. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're close to a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $12,000.  This recognizes your interest while still reflecting the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
