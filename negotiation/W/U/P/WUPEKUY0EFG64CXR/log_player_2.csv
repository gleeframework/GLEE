{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can do better.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. Offering $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable range.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $8,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. He still has 7 rounds left, giving him ample opportunity to find a more agreeable price or buy from John if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, Bob is still $2,000 away from his target price.  He has several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to explore if he can get closer to his desired price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his target of $8,000. He has only 3 rounds left, but Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance he can get the price lower. He should keep pushing for a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as Bob is only $1000 away from his target price.  However, this is the final round before he has to buy from John.
