"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $108. This is a fair price considering I'm already close to my maximum budget.  Let's meet in the middle.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $112.  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $112.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,
