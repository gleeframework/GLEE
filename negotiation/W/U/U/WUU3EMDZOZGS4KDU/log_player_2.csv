"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong offer that signals Bob's willingness to negotiate, but also shows a serious interest in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting closer to his $800,000 goal. Buying from John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing his willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's asking price. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully incentivize Alice to accept."
