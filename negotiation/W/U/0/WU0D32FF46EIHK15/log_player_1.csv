{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another party."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Highlighting another interested buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message avoids appearing desperate or overly aggressive, maintaining a professional and confident tone.

By setting the price at $950,000, I'm strategically balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to gain an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John."
