"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer that gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a high price, but I'm also prepared to potentially lower the price if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a little closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal. It's time to start getting serious about getting a deal done.  We're halfway through our rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob.  I have a few more rounds to work with, and I think I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go higher.  I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely."
