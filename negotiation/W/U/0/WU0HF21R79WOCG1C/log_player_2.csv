"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it at $95.  This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* You're willing to pay up to $100, so you can try to get a better deal than $95. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
