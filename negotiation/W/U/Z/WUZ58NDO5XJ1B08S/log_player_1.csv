Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we try $10,250? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, $10,250 is a good compromise. It's within a reasonable range, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward."
