Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  I'm confident that I can get at least $80 from John if I need to, so I'm willing to take a bit of a risk for a potentially higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and it's significantly higher than what I could get from John. I'll accept the offer and sell the product to Bob for $90."
