"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference at $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me.  $95 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go right now.",92.5,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we meet at $94?",94.0,Alice,5,
