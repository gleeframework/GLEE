Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks rejection, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The language is positive, emphasizing value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, a strong incentive to accept. You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your guaranteed minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could aim a bit higher, perhaps starting at $1,175,000, but the risk of rejection increases.  Negotiation is about finding the right balance between your aspirations and the likelihood of acceptance."
