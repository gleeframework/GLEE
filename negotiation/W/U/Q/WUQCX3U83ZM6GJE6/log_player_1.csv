Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming high is beneficial. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely if Bob declines."
