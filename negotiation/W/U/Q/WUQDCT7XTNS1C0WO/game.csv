"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $16,000 for this.  Let's meet in the middle. ",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $16,000?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,750?  This feels fair to both of us and keeps the negotiations moving forward.",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
