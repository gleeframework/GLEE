"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations with a price of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way up to $950,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $950,000.  Let's find a middle ground at $900,000.  This reflects the value I see in your product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $900,000.
