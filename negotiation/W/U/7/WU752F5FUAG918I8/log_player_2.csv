"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $110 for it. This allows us both to find a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value of this product for me. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. This would still be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your value and within my range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to counter with a price of $107 for the product. This slightly increases my previous offer but still keeps the transaction beneficial for both parties. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is only $7 above my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance she'll stick to her offer, and I might end up paying more in the long run.  It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the product or paying more."
