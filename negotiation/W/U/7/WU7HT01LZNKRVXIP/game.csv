"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? It's a reasonable compromise that brings us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $775,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $790,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value to both of us.",790000.0,Bob,6,
