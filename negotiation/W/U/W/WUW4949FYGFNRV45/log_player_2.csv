"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's worth significantly more than that to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her.  There's a chance she'll come down closer to her $8,000 valuation."
