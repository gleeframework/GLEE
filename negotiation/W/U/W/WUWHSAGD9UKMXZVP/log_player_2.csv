"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay $120 for the product, but you want to save as much money as possible. Since John is also willing to sell the product for $120, you're better off buying from John. This ensures you get the product at the lowest possible price."
