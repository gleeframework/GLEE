"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $18,000, considering its unique features and benefits.  I'm willing to start at $17,500 for you."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $17,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it, considering it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $14,000, it's not worth risking losing more in the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, though.  How about $16,000?  This is still a good price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his low offer, and I've already made concessions. It's clear we're not going to agree, and time is ticking.  I'll take John's offer of $15,000. It's a fair price and guarantees a sale without further negotiation."
