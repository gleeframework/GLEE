"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price. What do you think about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her opening offer leaves room for negotiation."
