"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $12,000. I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but no higher. I'm starting to think about exploring other options if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly signaling that he's not willing to meet near our desired price. His increments are getting smaller, and he's mentioning ""other options,"" indicating we're reaching the top of his budget.  While $9,500 is tempting, it's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk Bob walking away completely in future rounds."
