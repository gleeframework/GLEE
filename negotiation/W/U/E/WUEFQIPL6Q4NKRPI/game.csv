"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $12,000. I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is too low.  Let's make it $11,000 and call it a deal. This is a final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but no higher. I'm starting to think about exploring other options if we can't meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,6,
