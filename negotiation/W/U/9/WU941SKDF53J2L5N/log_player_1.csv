Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is closer to my budget. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm not budging beyond that. I'm starting to think that the product might not be worth the investment at this price point. I'd like to make one final offer: $1,150,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging from his $1,200,000 offer, and even dropped to $1,150,000.  He's also expressing doubts about the value. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and I risk losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
