"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $14,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's maximum price. It makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still being reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $13,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's only $500 more than his initial counteroffer and significantly less than John's price. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation.  There's a risk of Alice refusing future counteroffers, and the cost of going to John is higher. It's a good time to close the deal."
