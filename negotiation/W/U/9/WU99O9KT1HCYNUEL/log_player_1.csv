"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counter-offer and start the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a higher price.  While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to earn more than $13,000."
