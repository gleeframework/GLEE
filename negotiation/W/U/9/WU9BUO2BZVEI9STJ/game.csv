"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. $140 is a bit better, but I'm still not sure I can let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $155. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $155 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $145 for the product. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $152? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",152.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $152 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $148 for the product. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",148.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'll meet you at $149. That's as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",149.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate all your efforts, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $145 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Bob,10,
