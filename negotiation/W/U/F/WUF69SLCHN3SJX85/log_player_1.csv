Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I'm confident it's equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've crafted a message that highlights the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing the potential for mutual benefit. 
* **Product Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, as I'm confident in the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  However, I'm still comfortable with this price knowing I can sell it to John for $1,200,000 if Bob rejects."
