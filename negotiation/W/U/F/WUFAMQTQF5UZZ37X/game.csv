"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your offer is quite a bit below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last counteroffer? That would put us at $825,000. It feels like a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",775000.0,Bob,6,
