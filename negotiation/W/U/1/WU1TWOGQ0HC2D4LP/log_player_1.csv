Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This offer stands before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts the $1,100,000 offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price is significantly lower than my minimum ($1,200,000) but still a considerable profit above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and calling it an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
