Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer must be significantly higher than John's $1,000,000 to incentivize Bob to buy. 

This strategy aims for a win-win. Bob gets the product at a price lower than his perceived value, and you secure a profit significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
