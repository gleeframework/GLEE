Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000.  This presents an opportunity to negotiate a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice (a $400,000 gain over John's offer). 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to accept the offer without seeming overly aggressive."
