"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight that the product is worth $120 to him, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use ""What do you think?"" to signal I'm open to hearing his perspective and potentially adjust the price. 
* **Safeguard:**  While I'm optimistic about a deal with Bob, I know I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Reasonable:** While lower than my initial offer, $90 is still a good price, and I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $90 is good, I'm aiming for a bit more profit if possible.
* **Early Stage of Negotiation:** We're only in round 2, and there's time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still a little higher than where I need to be.  How about $95?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a better price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding him of the product's value to him, justifying my price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to encourage agreement.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'm leaving a little room for another counteroffer, keeping the negotiation active.
* **Avoidance of John's offer:** I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob, but I'm also mindful of the potential of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $92 is very close to my desired price point, and we're already in round 4.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that we could get stuck in a stalemate, and I might be forced to sell to John for less.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my initial target price, a successful deal with Bob could lead to future business opportunities.
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds, making it more likely I'll have to sell to John.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $95,  $92 is a solid price considering the current situation and the potential risks of further negotiation."
