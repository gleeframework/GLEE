"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $10,250.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has already lowered the price significantly from Alice's initial offer of $11,000.
* **Potential Risk:**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again risks Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $10,250 is the most sensible decision, as it secures the product at a price lower than John's and represents a significant saving for Bob."
