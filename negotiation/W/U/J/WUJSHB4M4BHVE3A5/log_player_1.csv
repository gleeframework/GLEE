Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal compared to his valuation of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a good deal, it's still below what I want to get for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll still get a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
