"Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair price.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you and allow me to move forward with the sale.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,150,000. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
