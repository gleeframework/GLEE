Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob would gain by purchasing the product, emphasizing the $300,000 savings.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation going.
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a floor price and allows me to be confident in walking away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. He clearly values the product and is willing to pay a premium, suggesting he might be willing to go a bit higher.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,200,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could sell to John now and guarantee $1,000,000, the potential for a better deal with Bob outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's offer while also moving the price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Emphasizing Savings:**  I'm again highlighting the value Bob would gain by purchasing the product at this price.
* **Staying Firm but Flexible:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing my ground and not significantly lowering my price.
* **Avoiding ""Lowball"" Offers:** I want to avoid offering too low of a price and giving the impression that I'm desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,150,000. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. Bob might not budge further, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit that is significantly higher than selling to John."
