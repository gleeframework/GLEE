This offer allows me to earn a significant profit, while still being attractive to Bob since he can get the product at a price much lower than its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer Bob and try to negotiate a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $650,000 is a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to a price that meets my needs."
