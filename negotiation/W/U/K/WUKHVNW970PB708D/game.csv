"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $500,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of this product and its potential for you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a good deal. Let's finalize this and make it happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
