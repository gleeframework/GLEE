"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" without being overly specific. This creates an aura of desirability.
* **Confident Tone:** We project confidence in the product's worth, which can subtly influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Establish a high initial reference point, potentially leading Bob to counteroffer closer to our desired range.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how eager he is to buy and provide insight into his negotiation style. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. 

While we could sell to John right now for our minimum, we are still in the early stages of negotiation with Bob. There is potential to negotiate a price closer to (or even above) his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your initial offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Controlled Concession:** We are making a significant price reduction of $300,000 from our initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility but avoids appearing desperate.
* **Reiterating Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value proposition to justify the high price. 
* **Setting the Tone:** By making a strong counteroffer, we are aiming to steer the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome for us.  

We are still significantly above Bob's offer, but this strategy aims to find a middle ground without dropping below our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still pretty far apart on price.  I can do $900,000, but that's really pushing my limit for this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer slightly, but it's still far below our $1,500,000 minimum and even further from his own $1,000,000 perceived value. This indicates room for negotiation.

We'll reject this offer to signal that we're serious about receiving a fair price and continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but I need you to understand that this offer significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This offer reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Constraints:** We're briefly recognizing Bob's budget concerns to show we're listening.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We are making a substantial move towards Bob's price range while still staying above our absolute minimum. This emphasizes our willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **Call to Action:** The phrase ""find a middle ground"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with a stronger offer and move closer to our target price. 

This offer aims to:

1.  **Signal Seriousness:** We're showing Bob we're willing to negotiate, but we need him to meet us closer to the middle.
2. **Maintain Value Perception:**  We avoid devaluing the product while still making a concession.

We're getting closer to a critical point in the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. However, that is absolutely as high as I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial moment. Bob has now reached his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). While this is still below our minimum, his language suggests this is his final offer. 

We need to decide:

1. **Accept:**  This secures a deal but at a $500,000 loss compared to selling to John.
2. **Sell to John:** This guarantees our minimum price but cuts off negotiations with Bob.
3. **Counteroffer:**  This keeps Bob in the game, but there's a risk he walks away if we push too hard.

Given we have four rounds remaining, we will take a calculated risk and reject Bob's offer. Our next counteroffer will be key to either closing a deal with Bob above his perceived value or motivating him to walk away."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting close, and I appreciate you coming up to your maximum.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're making it clear this is our last offer to add a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Compromise (Almost):**  We are moving significantly closer to Bob's offer by splitting the difference between his final offer ($1,000,000) and our previous offer ($1,500,000).  
* **Justification:**  Framing it as ""meeting halfway"" emphasizes fairness and puts the onus on Bob to accept.

This is a calculated gamble. Bob might walk away, but there's a good chance he'll accept a price slightly above his perceived value to avoid losing the deal. 

We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield significantly better results. This offer either secures a deal above Bob's initial offer or allows us to move on to John with time to spare."
