"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I realize the product is valuable, $1,450,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  To settle this quickly, how about $1,300,000? This is a fair offer considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
