"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your budget. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $13,500. Could we possibly aim for $12,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining the product I need.",12000.0,Bob,4,
