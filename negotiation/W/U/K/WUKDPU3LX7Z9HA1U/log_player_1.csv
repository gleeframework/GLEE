Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum price ($15,000). This gives me some room to negotiate while still securing a decent profit.
* The message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high starting point, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I also have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if Bob proves to be too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean losing out on potential profit.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value. 

**Strategy:**

My next counteroffer will aim to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price. I'll need to consider his budget constraints and find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This price is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's offer ($12,000) and my previous offer ($14,000). 
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget and reiterates my need for a certain profit margin. It also emphasizes the compromise I'm offering. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while still remaining firm on my minimum profit expectations. I'm hoping that this compromise will be appealing to Bob and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $13,500. Could we possibly aim for $12,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is insistent on his $12,000 budget. While I am willing to negotiate, I am not willing to go below my minimum price of $15,000.  The potential for further negotiation with Bob is low, and there is a risk of  a prolonged and unproductive negotiation process.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This decision prioritizes my profit and avoids further potential losses. Selling to John ensures I receive my desired value, leaving me with a successful outcome."
