"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. This is a high-quality item worth more than $100, and I believe it will be a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is close to your maximum, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to get the product at Alice's valuation.  It's a starting point, and we can negotiate upwards from here if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Considering your feedback, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $105 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice met you halfway, and $105 is a good price. It's a reasonable compromise to accept this offer."
