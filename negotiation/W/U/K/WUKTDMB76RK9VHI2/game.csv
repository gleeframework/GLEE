"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about I offer you $1,050,000 for the product? This still allows me to save some money while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,070,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit off. Let's try $1,075,000.  This is a final price from me, and it reflects a significant compromise on my end. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
