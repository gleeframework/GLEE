"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, it's possible he'll be willing to pay a premium to secure it. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't come close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $1,300,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in this product and be willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm also getting concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000, which is just a bit more than what I'd get from John. This is a fair price considering Bob values the product at $1,200,000. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are still too low. I'm not willing to risk losing another round, so I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and I can't afford to keep negotiating with Bob."
