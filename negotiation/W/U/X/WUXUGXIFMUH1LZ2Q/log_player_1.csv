Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A price of $2,000,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts, you'll earn a significant profit above your minimum. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John."
