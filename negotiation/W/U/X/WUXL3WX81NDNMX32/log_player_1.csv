{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit for Alice. 
* **""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you...""**: This message starts the negotiation in a friendly and positive tone, highlighting the potential benefit for Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Open the negotiation with a relatively high price:** This gives Alice a strong starting position and allows for potential concessions later.
* **Encourage Bob to consider the offer:** The positive message and the potential value proposition might make Bob more inclined to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  Alice can adjust her price based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects, Alice can either lower the price or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 she initially offered and the $15,000 she can get from John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my original price. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,500:** This price is a compromise, falling between Alice's initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive message:** The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a fair compromise.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiation position:**  Alice is not immediately accepting Bob's low offer, showing she is confident in the product's value.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** The counteroffer leaves room for Bob to counter again, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Keep the option of selling to John open:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, Alice can still sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,750? It's a compromise I'd be comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's still below her ideal price and significantly less than the $15,000 she can get from John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price or to sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $9,750 is getting closer. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a small step closer to my previous offer and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,000:** This price is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's counteroffer while still remaining above Alice's minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Positive message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes fairness and a mutual benefit, aiming to encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiation position:** Alice is not immediately accepting Bob's low offer, showing she is still confident in the product's value.
* **Encourage a final agreement:** The counteroffer is a small step towards Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to close the deal.
* **Keep the option of selling to John open:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, Alice can still sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? It's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 she can get from John.  

At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is high. Bob has stated this is his final offer and is willing to walk away. Further negotiation might lead to a prolonged process, potentially lowering the final price or even a breakdown in negotiations altogether.

By choosing to sell to John, Alice guarantees a higher price and avoids the uncertainty and potential loss of a deal with Bob."
