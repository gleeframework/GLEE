,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my original price. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,750? It's a compromise I'd be comfortable with.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $9,750 is getting closer. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a small step closer to my previous offer and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? It's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",9500.0,Bob,6,
