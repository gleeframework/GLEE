"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. I hope this price is more agreeable for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
