"Bob, I believe this product has immense value, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's true worth, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe a slightly higher price reflects the true value of this opportunity.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price is still a significant gain for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to counter with $1,150,000. This price is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, but not that much.  I'm offering a final price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair and mutually beneficial price. If you're not willing to go this high, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,100,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
