While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $1,150,000? This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow you to acquire a product that's worth significantly more to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
