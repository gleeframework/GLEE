Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $118? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is close to my minimum and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids risking losing the sale to another buyer."
