"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  I'm eager to work out a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's potential and its future benefit to you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
