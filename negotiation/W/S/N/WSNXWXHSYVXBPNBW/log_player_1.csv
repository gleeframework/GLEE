Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet you at $1,600,000. My maximum budget remains at $800,000. I would like to stick to this figure.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

}
```

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best decision at this point to avoid further time wasted and secure a guaranteed, favorable price."
