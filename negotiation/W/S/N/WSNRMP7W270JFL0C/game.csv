"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider a price of $12000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $14000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go to $13000.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. How about we compromise at $13500? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
