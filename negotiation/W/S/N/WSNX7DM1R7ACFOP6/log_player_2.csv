"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000 less from John. While it's tempting to save a bit more with Alice, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or even a stalemate.  It's better to secure the product at a price within your budget right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point that demonstrates you're serious about buying the product but are looking for a better deal.  

Alice has a strong incentive to accept, as this offer is still above her valuation.  If she rejects, you can then adjust your offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $13,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to your target of saving as much money as possible. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately forcing you to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
