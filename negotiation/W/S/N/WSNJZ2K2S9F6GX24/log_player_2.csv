# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and this offer reflects its worth.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a lower price."

While $17,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
