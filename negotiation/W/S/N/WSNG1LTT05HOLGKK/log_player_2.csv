"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $90 is below your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $80 valuation. If not, you can always buy from John for $100, which is still within your budget."
