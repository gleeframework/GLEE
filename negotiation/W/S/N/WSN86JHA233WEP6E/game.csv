"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you a lot of value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $9000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $10500. I think this price reflects the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're still interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $11000. I think this price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm open to further negotiation if you're still interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to push the price up to $10800, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $11200. I think this price is fair considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're still interested.",11200.0,Alice,7,
