"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given my budget and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product given its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $980,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",980000.0,Alice,5,
