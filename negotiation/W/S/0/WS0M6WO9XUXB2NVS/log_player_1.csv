Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $800,000, so this offer ensures I maximize potential profit."
