"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $17,000 right now. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $17,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $18,500. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Would you consider $18,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product for $19,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",19000.0,Alice,5,
