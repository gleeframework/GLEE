Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.
