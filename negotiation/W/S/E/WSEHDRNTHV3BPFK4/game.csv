"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,350,000.  However, I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
