Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's a bit more than my minimum value and leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to the product's value to Bob, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can do better. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $9,000. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this encourages him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum and even less than what John is offering. I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still better than selling to Bob at such a low price."
