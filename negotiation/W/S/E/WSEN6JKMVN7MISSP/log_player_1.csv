Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a price I feel is fair, given the potential benefits this product could bring.  I understand you may need some time to consider this, but I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial opportunity. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000, which is $300,000 higher than my guaranteed minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly, highlighting the potential value to Bob, and avoids pressure. It emphasizes that this is an opportunity for both parties to benefit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a price higher than my minimum gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting potential benefits for Bob helps him understand the worth of the product. 
* **No Pressure:**  The message avoids putting Bob on the spot, allowing him to think about the offer. 

By starting high and focusing on value, I aim to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John for my guaranteed minimum."
