``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me the chance to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. It's a fair price that takes both our needs into account. I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you, and this price allows you to make a solid investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9800, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  This would allow me to invest in this product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better offer. I'll see if Bob is willing to increase his offer in the next round."
