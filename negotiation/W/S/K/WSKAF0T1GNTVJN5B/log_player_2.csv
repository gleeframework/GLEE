(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $10500. It's a fair price that takes both our needs into account. I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you, and this price allows you to make a solid investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his limit. He can still try to negotiate a lower price and might be able to get closer to his desired price point.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a more favorable deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $9,800, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  This would allow me to invest in this product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value our negotiation and your interest in my product. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price that balances your budget and my minimum value.  Let's close this deal and make this product work for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is the lowest she's offered so far, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  With only 3 rounds left, it's not likely that Bob will be able to negotiate a price lower than $8,000. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiations."
