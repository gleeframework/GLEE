"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low for me. It's a great product with a lot of potential for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great value considering the product's worth.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
