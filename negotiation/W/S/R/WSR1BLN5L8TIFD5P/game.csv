"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your company.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This represents a substantial opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will deliver a strong return on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still provides a great deal of value for you. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be feasible?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Time is running out, so let's try to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? This seems like a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to close this deal, and I'm happy to compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1,190,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
