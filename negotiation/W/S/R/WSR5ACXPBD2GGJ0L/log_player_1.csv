Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher elsewhere, justifying the price without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high, allowing for potential negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:**  While starting high is a good strategy, be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly if Bob shows resistance.  You want to get the best price possible, but not lose the sale entirely."
