"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about $1,250,000? This price is still within your stated value for the product and offers a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price. $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
