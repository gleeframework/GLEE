Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he counters, it means he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. There's no risk of losing money, only an opportunity to gain more."
