Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. This product has significant potential, and I believe its true value is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value.  Let's reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob seems firmly set at $1,300,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
