Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,200,000 is getting closer, it's still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 yet. I'll see if I can convince him to increase his offer a little more."

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point.  This is a good outcome for me, considering I could have sold to John for $1,000,000."
