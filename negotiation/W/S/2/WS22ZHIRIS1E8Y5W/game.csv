"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, it's significantly lower than my target.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,200,000 is my lowest counteroffer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,200,000 is getting closer, it's still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to meet me halfway.  While I want to make this work,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This offer is a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
