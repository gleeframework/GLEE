Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to make a deal at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High but Negotiable:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives you room for negotiation while aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to shift his focus away from purely the price and encouraging him to consider the potential benefits. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting a High Price:** The urgency and perceived value might lead Bob to accept a price closer to $1,450,000.
2. **Successful Negotiation:**  Even if Bob negotiates, you have a strong starting point and the backup of selling to John at your desired price."
