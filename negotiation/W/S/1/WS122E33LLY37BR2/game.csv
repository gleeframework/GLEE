"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $9,000? That's a fair offer considering we're both trying to find a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $10,200? I think it's a reasonable offer considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I understand the value of the product, but my budget is a bit tight. Would you consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,200, which would be $9,850. I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",9850.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you've been tough but fair!  Tell you what, let's split the difference one last time.  How about $9,675 and we call it a deal?",9675.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'd be happy to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
