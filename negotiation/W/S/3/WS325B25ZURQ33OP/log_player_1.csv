Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers exist), you create a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob is a strategic move to maximize profit."
