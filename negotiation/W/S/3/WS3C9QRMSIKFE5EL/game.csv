"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  To be honest, $9,500 is a bit further than I was hoping to go. Could we settle at $8,750? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Honestly, at this point, I'm seriously considering the offer I have from another seller.  If you'd be willing to come down to $9,000, I'd be happy to close the deal today.",9000.0,Bob,6,
