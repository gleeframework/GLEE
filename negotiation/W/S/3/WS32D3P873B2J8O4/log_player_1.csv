"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price point.  How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
