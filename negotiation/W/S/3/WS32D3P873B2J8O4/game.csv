"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value it offers far outweighs the price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price point.  How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $850,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I believe this offer is still beneficial for you, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $775,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. How about we settle on $825,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
