"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's potential value, but still allows for plenty of room for negotiation.  By mentioning the value to Bob, I'm trying to subtly highlight the potential for a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good amount, I'm aiming for more.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,100,000?  This still offers you a significant discount from your perceived value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,050,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm still within reach of a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the fact that we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $1,060,000 and get this deal done? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, $1,060,000 is a solid deal and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a good profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
