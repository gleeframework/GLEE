"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,
