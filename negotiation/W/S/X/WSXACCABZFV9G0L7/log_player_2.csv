"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above the product's value to Bob ($8,000). It's worth negotiating further to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still more than the product's value to Bob ($8,000), but it's significantly closer to his desired price and lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer is the most cost-effective option, allowing Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
