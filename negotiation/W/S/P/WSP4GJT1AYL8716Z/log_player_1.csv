Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum while still being attractive to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you get a good price.

This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible price from Bob before resorting to the guaranteed $100 sale to John."
