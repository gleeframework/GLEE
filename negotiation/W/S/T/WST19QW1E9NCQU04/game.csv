"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $900,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still be a very good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a great price, and I respect that.  I can't go all the way down to $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would still be a very good deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
