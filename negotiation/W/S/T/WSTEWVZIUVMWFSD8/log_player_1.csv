Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has an incentive to negotiate. It also allows you to assess Bob's interest and negotiation strategy before potentially turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's still significantly below the product's worth to him. There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. It's also closer to the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to the product's value to him.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
