"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps around $750000? I believe we can find a fair solution.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $875000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $825000? This would allow me to make a purchase while staying true to my financial plan.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
