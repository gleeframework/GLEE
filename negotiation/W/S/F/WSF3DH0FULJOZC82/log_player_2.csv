"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While she's coming down in price, it's still not within his budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price.  There's no reason to rush into buying from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we can find a price closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still above Bob's comfort zone. There's still room for negotiation.  He should continue to bargain and see if he can get closer to his target price.  Buying from John is still an option, but it's not the best move yet, given the potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product for $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's comfort zone, and there are only three rounds left.  Given the potential for further negotiation, it's likely that Alice won't drop significantly lower.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the most sensible option at this point. It's within Bob's budget and offers a guaranteed purchase without further negotiation."
