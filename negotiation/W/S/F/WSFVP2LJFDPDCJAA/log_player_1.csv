Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, she should aim for a price higher than that.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at or below this price would be selling yourself short.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer of $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate while still securing a significant profit for Alice.  

By starting high but still leaving a slight margin, Alice increases her chances of securing the best possible deal."
