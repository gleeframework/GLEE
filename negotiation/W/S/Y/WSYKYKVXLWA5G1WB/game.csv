"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $750,000 falls significantly short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, and I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This price still offers you a substantial value for the product, and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  I hope we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
