Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to try and get a better price than Bob's counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for $900,000 right away."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm not ready to settle yet, but I'm also wary of running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would love to get closer to $1,000,000, I'm getting concerned about running out of rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $960,000 is still a significant profit, and I'd rather lock in that amount than risk losing the deal entirely."
