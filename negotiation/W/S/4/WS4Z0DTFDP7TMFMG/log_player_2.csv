"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. You can save a substantial amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
