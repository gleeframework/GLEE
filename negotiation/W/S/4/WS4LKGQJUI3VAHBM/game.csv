"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This offer is a reasonable compromise and reflects the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
