Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. Since I have the option to buy from John for $8,000, I'll take that deal to save myself $2,000."
