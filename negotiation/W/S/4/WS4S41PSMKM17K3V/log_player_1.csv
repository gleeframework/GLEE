{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's a good deal for both of us."
