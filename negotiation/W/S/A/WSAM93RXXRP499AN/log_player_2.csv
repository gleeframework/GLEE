"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement closer to $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and only $500 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it risks Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price."
