"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to offer $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
