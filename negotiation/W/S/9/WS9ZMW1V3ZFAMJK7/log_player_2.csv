"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is better than her previous one, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  He has rounds left and the option to buy from John, so he should continue negotiating."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.
