Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to me.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John."
