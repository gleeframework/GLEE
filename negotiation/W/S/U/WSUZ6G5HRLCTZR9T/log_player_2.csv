Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $75.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product.

Alice has come down to Bob's price ceiling. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at the same price."
