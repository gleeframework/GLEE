{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation if needed.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $70 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $85?  I'm confident you'll love this product!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $70 is low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $75.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
