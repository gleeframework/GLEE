**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, we still have room to negotiate and time before we have to consider John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to move towards a middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I sense we're nearing a deal. How about we settle this right now at $1,009,375?  That's me making a significant move to show I'm serious about closing this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1009375
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Firm:** We're moving closer to Bob's offers, showing flexibility. However, we're still holding above the $1 million mark, which seems achievable.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""settle this right now,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to agree or counter with a more substantial increase. 
* **Future Concessions:** We haven't met Bob in the middle yet, leaving room for a final concession in a later round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $995,312.50. This lets us both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,312.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,312.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Offer:**  $995,312.50 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum by almost $200,000.
* **Deal Closure:** Bob is clearly motivated to close the deal ""right now,""  reducing the risk of him stalling or significantly lowering his offer in the final rounds.
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds left, there's a risk that continued negotiation might not result in a significantly better offer, especially if Bob is becoming less flexible."
