Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $700,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
