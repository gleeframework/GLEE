"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional capabilities and the unique benefits it offers, I estimate its true worth to be around $800,000. However, I am confident that with your expertise and strategic implementation, this investment will yield substantial returns.

Considering the immense value this product can bring to your business, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction while also allowing me to cover the development costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am here to answer any questions you might have and assist you in making an informed decision.

Best regards,
Alice
