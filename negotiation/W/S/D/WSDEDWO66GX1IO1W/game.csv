"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the pricing. While I believe my initial offer reflects the product's true value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,600,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
