"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop my price to $980,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still at my limit. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it'll allow us to close the deal quickly.",900000.0,Bob,6,
