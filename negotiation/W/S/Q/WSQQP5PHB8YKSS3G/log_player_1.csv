Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the progress is too slow. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 within the remaining rounds.  It makes more business sense to take the sure profit with John rather than risk Bob walking away."
