"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves some profit for me, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
