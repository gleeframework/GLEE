Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for a counter-offer:** If Bob is interested, he's likely to counter with a lower offer, giving you an opportunity to negotiate.

I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'm going to counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves some profit for me, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By reducing my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, I demonstrate a desire to reach a deal.
* **Maintain a profitable margin:** $1,350,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** The $1,350,000 offer allows for potential adjustments if Bob wants to counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us both to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close enough to my desired profit margin. While I would prefer to sell it to John for $1,500,000, I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a lower price."
