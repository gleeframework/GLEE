# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  This is a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. If not, no worries, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer.  Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
