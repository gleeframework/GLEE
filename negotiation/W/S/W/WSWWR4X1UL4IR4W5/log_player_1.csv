"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because while it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I'm confident you'll find the product well worth this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope you can meet me at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** again. Even though it's my minimum price, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I'm still hopeful we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

I'm proposing a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer.  This is another attempt to find a middle ground, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I am still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. I hope you can reconsider your position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. He's not willing to budge, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. I'm not getting any closer to my desired price, and I need to secure the sale."
