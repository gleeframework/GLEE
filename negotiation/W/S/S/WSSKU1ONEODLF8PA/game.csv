"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
