Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, as I believe it's a fair price considering my own assessment of the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
