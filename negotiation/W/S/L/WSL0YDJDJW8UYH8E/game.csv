"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference a bit? Would $115 work for you?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can ensure you'll be happy with your purchase.",120.0,Alice,5,
