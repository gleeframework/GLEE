Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference a bit? Would $115 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round. I'm still confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can ensure you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 120}
