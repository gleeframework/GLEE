"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, considering it's value to me.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $125. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to compromise again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $15. Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,5,
