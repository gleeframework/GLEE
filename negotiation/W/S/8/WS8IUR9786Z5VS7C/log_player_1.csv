"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still leaves you with a healthy profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a price closer to what I'm looking for. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the value of the product for you while ensuring I can reach my desired outcome. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my target.  I'm willing to offer $1,010,000.  This is a fair compromise and lets us finalize this deal. Let's move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is getting close to my desired outcome.  I'm worried that if I reject this offer, he might walk away, or I might not be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's better to close this deal now and secure the profit."
