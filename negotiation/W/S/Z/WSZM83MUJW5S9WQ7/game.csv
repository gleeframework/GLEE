"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be open to that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $97.50 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $102.50, which would be $96.25. Would you be open to that?",96.25,Bob,6,
