"Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $9,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
