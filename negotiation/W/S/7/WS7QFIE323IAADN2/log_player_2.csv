"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $120 to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking for a product worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $150.  Since you can get the same product from John for $100, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
