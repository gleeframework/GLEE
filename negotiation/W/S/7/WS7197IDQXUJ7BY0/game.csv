"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000 to $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1100000? This would allow us to finalize the deal while giving me a reasonable price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1100000, which would be $1150000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a fair price.  However,  I'm still hesitant at $1150000.  Let's split the difference one more time - I'm willing to pay $1125000 for the product. This seems like a solid compromise that would benefit both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1125000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1175000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1175000 is still a bit too high for me. We've been going back and forth, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept your offer of $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1150000, which would be $1175000. However, I'm also considering other interested buyers, and I need to make a decision soon. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1175000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
