{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $130. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. If he rejects, I'll have more information about his willingness to pay and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be able to lower the price to $100? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer to my desired range, I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially get a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Signal my willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob I'm not easily swayed and am willing to fight for a better price.
* **Gain more information:** I can use the next round to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially get a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $130 or potentially higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $115. Let's meet in the middle at $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it works for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $110, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and explaining my reasoning for wanting a higher price. I'm framing the compromise as beneficial for both of us. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that satisfies both parties. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to make further adjustments in the next round. However, I'm confident that this offer is a reasonable starting point for a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $95 as the price for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $95 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also below my counteroffer of $110, which indicates that he might be willing to go a bit higher. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:** I'm demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too low.
* **Increase the pressure:**  Rejecting his offer puts pressure on Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $110. If he rejects again, I'm prepared to consider selling to John for $150."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $105. This price is a good balance between our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $105, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while also reminding him that my minimum price is higher than his last offer. 
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my target price while still being reasonable.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to consider selling to John, but I believe this offer has a good chance of securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $100 as the final price for the product. I believe this price offers a good balance between our needs. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer than his previous offers, I'm not willing to compromise further, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

By selling to John, I can:

* **Maximize my profit:** I'll earn $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  I won't have to engage in more rounds of bargaining, saving me time and potentially avoiding further disagreements.

While I appreciate Bob's attempts to reach a deal, my goal is to earn the most money possible for my product. Therefore, selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
