Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with its value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

Bob's offer is too low, but it's better than selling to John. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $9,800 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not acceptable. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,900 for the product. This offers a slight compromise while still aligning with its value to me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds and I'm worried I won't be able to get a better price. It's better to sell to John now and guarantee myself $10,000."
