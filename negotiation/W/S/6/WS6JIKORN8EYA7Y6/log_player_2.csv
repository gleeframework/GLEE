Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $108. It's a small step back from $105, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to inch the price up. While we might be able to get a slightly better deal, the difference is getting smaller and we risk Alice becoming firmer in her position. Accepting at $108 is a reasonable compromise."
