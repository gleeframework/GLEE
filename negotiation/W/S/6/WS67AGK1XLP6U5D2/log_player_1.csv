Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While the message is firm, offering $500 less than Bob's perceived value might entice him to accept without further haggling.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer in John, giving her leverage. She doesn't need to desperately lowball the price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a potentially quick, highly profitable sale to Bob and the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
