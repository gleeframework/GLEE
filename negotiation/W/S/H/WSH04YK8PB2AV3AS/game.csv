"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $120? That seems fair to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,
