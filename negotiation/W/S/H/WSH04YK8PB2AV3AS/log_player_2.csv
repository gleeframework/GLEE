"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my ideal price range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $120? That seems fair to me."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm offering a price that is the maximum Alice stated she would sell for. Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $125 is a reasonable price, saving $25 off John's price. It's time to accept the offer."
