Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to create a positive association.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""What do you think?"" to indicate that I'm open to a counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $105 falls below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation going while maintaining my goal of getting a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $105 doesn't quite cover my costs.  Would you be willing to go up to $110? That would be a fair compromise and a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:** I'm increasing the price by $5, which is a more manageable increment for Bob. 
* **Highlight the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the higher price.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I'm still using friendly language like ""would you be willing"" to keep the negotiation positive. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting closer to my minimum price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $108 is only slightly higher than Bob's initial offer and still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.  
* **John offers a better price:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $120. 

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the chances of getting a significantly better price are slim. It's more efficient to sell the product to John and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
