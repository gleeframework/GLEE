"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need us to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,010,000?",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my target, Bob, but I still think we can do better than $1,010,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 - it's a fair offer, and it avoids us dragging this negotiation out further.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already told you that $1,050,000 is my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at $1,050,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
