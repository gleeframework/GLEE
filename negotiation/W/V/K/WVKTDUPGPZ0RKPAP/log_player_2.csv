Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you that $1,050,000 is my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're not willing to meet me at $1,050,000, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at $1,050,000 and has indicated she's willing to walk away. While you could try one more counteroffer in Round 10, there's a real risk Alice won't budge, forcing you to buy from John at $1,200,000.  

Accepting the $1,050,000 offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's, making it the best option at this stage."
