"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can get the product for less than $100, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $92.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still get the product for less than $92.50, so rejecting Alice's offer is still the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to give up on $92, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $91.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $91.50 is still within your budget, and you've already rejected a lower price from her. Accepting her offer is the best course of action at this point."
