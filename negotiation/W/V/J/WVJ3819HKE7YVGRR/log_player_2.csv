"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that he's serious about negotiating and isn't afraid to push for a better deal. $10,500 is a halfway point between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price. This gives Alice room to counter without immediately rejecting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He's willing to keep negotiating and hasn't reached his limit yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000?  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price but is getting closer to Alice's offer. By offering $11,000, Bob shows he's serious about making a deal while still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that might lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250. This is a good price for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product.  Accepting the offer now saves him money compared to buying from John, and he's still able to get the product at a decent price."
