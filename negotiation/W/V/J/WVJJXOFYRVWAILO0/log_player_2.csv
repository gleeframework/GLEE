It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets a strong negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $850,000 is a good price, especially considering I have a fallback option of $1,000,000 with John. There's always a risk of getting a better price, but the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal."
