Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valued at $10,000, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to maximize my potential profit by starting with a higher offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message implies scarcity and value, which might make Bob more inclined to accept even a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still acknowledging Bob's valuation of the product."
