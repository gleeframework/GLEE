{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, $18,000 is still too high. He should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $8000, which is $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still above his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating for a lower price.  It's also worth noting that he has a fallback option with John at $8,000, giving him more leverage to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, which would be $10,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice is coming down in price, $14,000 is still above his budget and significantly higher than the $8,000 offer from John.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price or a price closer to John's offer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying this product. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $11500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $12500. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $12,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed option from John at a lower price, it's the best decision for him to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
