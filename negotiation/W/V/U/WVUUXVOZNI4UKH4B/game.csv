"Alice,  $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $18000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $8000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $8000, which is $13000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, which would be $10500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider!",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying this product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $11500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit further. I can offer it to you for $12500. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement!",12500.0,Alice,9,
