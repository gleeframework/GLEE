"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves me a decent profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price to $950,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm going to continue to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $900,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still hoping to secure a deal with Bob.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to his own valuation, and I'm not confident I can get a price that's closer to my desired minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at a good price, and I need to prioritize securing that profit."
