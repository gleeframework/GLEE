"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this work for both of us. It's a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still unable to meet you at $8,500. I would like to propose $8,200 as a compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential we see in working together, I'm willing to come down to $8,300.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",8300.0,Alice,5,
