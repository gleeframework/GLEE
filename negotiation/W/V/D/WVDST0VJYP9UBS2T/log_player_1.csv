Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still find the $1750000 price point too high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1600000? I believe this would better align with the value I see in the product while staying within my financial limits.
