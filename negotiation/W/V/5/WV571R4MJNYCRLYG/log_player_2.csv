"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money.  
* **Justified offer:**  Bob references the product's value to both parties, suggesting he's not just making a random number. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, giving Bob leverage in the upcoming rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still a gap of $100,000.  
* **Leverage:**  Bob is in a strong position. He can reject this offer and continue negotiating, knowing he has John as a backup option. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  By continuing to negotiate, Bob might be able to secure a price closer to his desired $950,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. How about $1,000,000? This would allow us both to close a deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's offer. 
* **Reaching a reasonable middle ground:** $1,000,000 is a fair price that balances Alice's need to profit and Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Strong position:** Bob knows he can still walk away and buy from John, giving him leverage in the negotiation."
