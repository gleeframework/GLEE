"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for it. I would like to propose a counteroffer at this amount.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately far below what this product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1000000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's above the value I place on the product. Would you consider reducing the price to $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  While I'm open to compromise, $900000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $950000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still feel that $950000 is slightly beyond my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $925000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
