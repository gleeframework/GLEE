Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives him a reason to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to earn a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not closing the door on further discussions by clearly stating I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can then consider lowering the price slightly or moving on to John if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $800000 for it. I would like to propose a counteroffer at this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me. Therefore, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round of negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still potentially enticing to Bob. By rejecting his offer, I am demonstrating my commitment to achieving a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately far below what this product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  The message explicitly states the justification for the counteroffer, acknowledging Bob's budget limitations while highlighting the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I am open to further discussions, indicating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects it, I can either make a final counteroffer closer to his price or opt for selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1000000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's above the value I place on the product. Would you consider reducing the price to $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John would be a more profitable outcome. I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, I'm  making it clear that I am not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum. I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer, in an attempt to reach a compromise. If Bob doesn't budge, I will move to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  While I'm open to compromise, $900,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $950,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to find a middle ground. It's a small reduction from my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Clear Message:**  The message emphasizes the compromise I'm making and highlights the value of the product. It sets a tone of finality, suggesting that this is my last offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message explicitly mentions closing the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will proceed to sell to John. This is a strategic move to demonstrate that I am serious about the deal and not willing to continue negotiating indefinitely. It also avoids the risk of further concessions leading to a less profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I still feel that $950000 is slightly beyond my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation would likely result in more concessions from my side and a less profitable deal. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit and avoids the risk of further price reductions during negotiations with Bob. It's important to prioritize maximizing profit and recognizing when it's time to move on from a potential buyer who isn't willing to meet my minimum requirements."
