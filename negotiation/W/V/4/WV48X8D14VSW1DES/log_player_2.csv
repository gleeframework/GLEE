Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is unfortunately far below what this product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.

To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $950000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value this product brings.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.
