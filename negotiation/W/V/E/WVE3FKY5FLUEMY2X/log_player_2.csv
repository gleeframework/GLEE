"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than what you'd pay John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. It's still within a range where Alice might be willing to accept, given she values the product at $1,200,000.  We'll see how she reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above what you'd pay John. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can close the deal at a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting John's price. Given that Alice values the product higher and has already lowered her price, there's a good chance she'll accept this offer. If she doesn't, you can always go with John, but this is a good opportunity to try and finalize the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to what you'd pay John. While it's still slightly higher, there's a good chance that if you reject it, Alice may raise her price again or become less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure the product for a slightly higher price than risk losing it entirely.  Also, with only 5 rounds left, there's less time to negotiate further."
