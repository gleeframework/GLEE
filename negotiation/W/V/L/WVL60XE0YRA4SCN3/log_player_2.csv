"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell it for.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Do you think that would work?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure an even better deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and respectful while clearly stating your position. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $60, we're aiming for a price well below our $80 maximum and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This creates a space for counteroffers and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Would you be interested in that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than John's $80 price.  There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I could go up to $70.  That's a fair offer considering its current market value."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By increasing our offer to $70, we're demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying below our $80 limit.
* **Market Value:** By mentioning ""current market value,"" we subtly imply that we've researched the product's price and are aware of other options (like John's offer).
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price that's roughly in the middle of Alice's previous offer ($90) and our last offer ($60). This shows a desire to compromise and find a solution that works for both parties."
