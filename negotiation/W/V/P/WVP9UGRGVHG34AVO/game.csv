"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the product within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
