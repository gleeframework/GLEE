"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer, but it's worth exploring to see if a mutually agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's closer to his desired price point of $12,000, and significantly lower than John's $15,000 price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price."
