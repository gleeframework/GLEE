Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room to negotiate a price that's beneficial to both of you.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you're serious about selling the product but you're not desperate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what you're aiming for. There's room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Still profitable:** It's above your minimum and still provides a good profit for you.
* **Room for negotiation:** You're leaving a bit of room to potentially settle in the middle ground."
