Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob.  He's clearly interested, and $1,200,000 is still a good profit for me.  But I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

I've made a few concessions already, and I'm getting a bit nervous about running out of time. $1,280,000 is a solid profit, and I'm not sure Bob is going to budge further.  It's time to take the deal and move on."
