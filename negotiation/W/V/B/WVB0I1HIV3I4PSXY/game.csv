"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product offers.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $13250?",13250.0,Bob,6,
