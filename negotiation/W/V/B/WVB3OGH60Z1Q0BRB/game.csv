"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you see in this product for me.  However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product for you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
