"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $18000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18000 is way out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $12000.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  That's still a good profit for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going below $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession to $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
