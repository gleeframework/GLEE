"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While I appreciate your offer, the $950,000 falls quite a bit short of its true value and potential. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
