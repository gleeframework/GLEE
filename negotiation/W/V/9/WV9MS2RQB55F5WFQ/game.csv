"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than you initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional support and training to sweeten the deal. I'll include a comprehensive onboarding package worth $1000. So, if you're willing to meet me at $11000, I'll throw in the onboarding package for free. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
