"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the value Bob places on the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Building rapport:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and using a friendly tone to build a positive relationship.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm not explicitly stating a time limit, but by reminding him of the potential for a counteroffer, I'm subtly implying that the current price is the best he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm not accepting it, showing him that I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying my higher price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise, but still allows me to earn more than selling to John.
* **Reiterate urgency:**  By saying ""Let me know what you think"", I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, pushing him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob walking away or the negotiations dragging on too long. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable deal and keeps the process moving."
