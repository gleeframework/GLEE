As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1400000. This price takes into account the product's value to you, as well as its overall worth to me.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we discuss this further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1320000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a more reasonable compromise considering your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1320000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target of $1200000. How about $1250000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
