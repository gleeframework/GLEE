Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. By starting high and showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping to maximize my potential earnings. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. While he's shown interest, his offer is too low. It's better to reject and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This puts pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,000?  That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing a price of $12,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message highlights the compromise I'm making to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** The message uses positive language to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price point while still appearing reasonable and willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable value. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price. It also avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal. I'm willing to settle at this point to ensure a profitable transaction."
