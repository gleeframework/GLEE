"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000). This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget.

**Strategy:**

I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer. If he's willing to negotiate, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer. If he rejects immediately, I know I need to adjust my strategy or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my initial price to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I believe I can potentially get a better price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer with a price that's slightly lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm reducing my offer by $100,000, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price significantly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to gauge whether Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if his budget is truly limited. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm getting a decent return on my investment.

**Strategy:**

By lowering the price slightly, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to counteroffer again, allowing me to understand his upper limit.  If he still refuses, I'll need to consider selling to John, as my chances of getting a better price are dwindling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer is a slight improvement, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle for a low price yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,250,000 and my last offer of $1,400,000. This will continue to show my willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Consistency:** I'm reducing my offer by another $50,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise while maintaining a consistent strategy of gradually lowering the price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my last offer and Bob's offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting this offer and making the sale to John a more attractive option.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I might be forced to lower the price further or consider selling to John. However, I still believe there's potential to negotiate a favorable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price range, especially considering we are already halfway through the negotiation.
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is high.
* **Guarantee vs. Uncertainty:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a significant profit, while continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. 

**Strategy:**

Although I might be able to get a slightly higher price with more negotiation, the risk of ending up with a lower offer or even selling to John for $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a substantial profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
