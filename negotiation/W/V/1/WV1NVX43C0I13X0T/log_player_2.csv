Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession and sell the product to you for $10,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer of $10,000. It's better to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
