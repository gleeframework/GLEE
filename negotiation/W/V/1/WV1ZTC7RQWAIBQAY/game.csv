"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me is $800,000, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $820,000, which is a bit higher than your offer, but still a good compromise. Let me know if this works for you!",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm interested in the product, $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? That way we both get a fair deal, and I can move forward with the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,4,
