Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he could potentially profit up to $200,000 if he buys it from you and resells.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"":**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically benefit both of you.

**The Offer**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable. Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal too.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I consider other offers. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This gives you a chance to acquire it at a significant discount compared to its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this strategy?**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,150,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth and the risk of missing out.
* **""Fairness"":** Framing the price as a ""discount"" helps Bob perceive the deal as beneficial, even though it's significantly above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:** Avoid mentioning John or your guaranteed $1,000,000.  Your negotiating power comes from Bob believing this is his best chance to get the product."
