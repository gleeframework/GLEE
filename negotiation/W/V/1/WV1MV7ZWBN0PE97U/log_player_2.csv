"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, a price that I believe reflects its worth to you while also being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
