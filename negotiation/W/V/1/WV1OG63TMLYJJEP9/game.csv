"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $17500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $17500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $19500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",19500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $19000. This is the best price I can offer considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,7,
