Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,400,000.  This is a good starting point as it's below my minimum desired price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the value the product provides for Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting at a price slightly below my minimum to encourage Bob to engage. If he rejects, I'll counter with a slightly higher price, keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000. The goal is to maximize my profit, but I need to balance that with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Moving to the next round:** I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, there's still a chance I can get a better deal from Bob. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value the product provides for Bob. It also expresses my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us, showing that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward while still maximizing my profit.  By counteroffering with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but I also expect a fair price. This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,320,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I can get from John. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while maintaining the option of selling to John as a safety net. Even if I don't reach my desired price with Bob, I'm confident I can still secure a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,320,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,335,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1335000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $1,335,000.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** The message remains positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both parties. It emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product, hoping to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the gap between our offers while keeping the negotiation moving.  By offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer, I show I'm flexible but also determined to get a price closer to my minimum. This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my desired minimum of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer is high. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John is a guaranteed buyer, and his offer provides the maximum profit.  There's no point in risking a lower price when a better option is readily available.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit.  While negotiating with Bob could potentially lead to a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and getting a lower price is significant. Selling to John guarantees my desired minimum price, making it the most logical decision."
