Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,800,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still less than my ideal price, it's only $100,000 less than my initial counteroffer.  Given that we're already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. $1,700,000 is a good profit and it's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
