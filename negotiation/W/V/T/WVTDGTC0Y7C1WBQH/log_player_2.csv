Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

We're in the final stages of the negotiation, so we need to make a strong counteroffer. $950,000 is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for us and leaves some room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that we're willing to meet Alice halfway, which could incentivize her to accept."
