Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This seems like a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so my counteroffer to you is $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget. You've already negotiated a bit and it's unlikely you'll get her to go any lower. At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option to ensure you acquire the product while staying within your budget."
