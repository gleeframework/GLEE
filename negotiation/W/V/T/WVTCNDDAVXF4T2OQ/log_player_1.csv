Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 for the product, as that's what I'd get from John.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **The offer:** I'm offering the product for $1,150,000, which is a good compromise between our two positions. This allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum while still leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still keeping the deal attractive for Bob."
