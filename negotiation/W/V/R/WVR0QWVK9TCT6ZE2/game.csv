"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is my final concession, what do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $810000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $810000 and $775000, which would be $792500. Can you consider that?",792500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $810000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $805000. This is my last offer, what do you think?",805000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making one last concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $805000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $805000 and $792500, which would be $798750. Can you consider that?",798750.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're in a bit of a stalemate, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $805000, and I think we've already established that. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'm counteroffering at $802500. This is my final offer, what do you think?",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $802500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $802500 and $792500, which would be $797500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",797500.0,Bob,10,
