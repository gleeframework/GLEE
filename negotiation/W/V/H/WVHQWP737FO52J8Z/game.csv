"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500.  How about $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to $10,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
