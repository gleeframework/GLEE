# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to invest in our product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose a counteroffer of $670000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved very close to your last counteroffer.  At this point, it's a good idea to accept and close the deal.  While you could try to squeeze out another $10,000, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and possibly leading to a longer negotiation is not worth it.  The $670,000 price is a significant savings compared to buying from John and still provides a fair price for both parties."
