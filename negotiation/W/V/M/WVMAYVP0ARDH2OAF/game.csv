"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this and make it a win-win situation.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $900,000.  How about we settle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm still not quite there at $875,000. Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $880,000?  This would be a fair price, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",880000.0,Bob,6,
