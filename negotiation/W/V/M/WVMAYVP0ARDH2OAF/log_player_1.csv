"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's finalize this and make it a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $900,000.  How about we settle at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm still not quite there at $875,000. Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $880,000?  This would be a fair price, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and we're getting near the end of the negotiations.  It's not my ideal price, but I'm comfortable accepting it to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether or having to settle for John's lower offer."
