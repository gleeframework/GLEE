"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a great price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $85.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $77.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $77.50 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $82.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80?",80.0,Bob,6,
