Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **John's Offer:**  John will buy the product for $80 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $110, you are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value, making it a good deal for him.
* **Profitable for you:**  It's significantly more than your minimum selling price and John's offer. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
