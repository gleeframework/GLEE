"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget ($12,000), you know you have an alternative seller (John) willing to sell it for that maximum price. This puts you in a good position to negotiate. By rejecting Alice's first offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her own perceived value of the product ($8,000)."
