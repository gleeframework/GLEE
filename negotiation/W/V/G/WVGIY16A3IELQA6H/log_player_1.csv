"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with great potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit. 
* **Motivational Message:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is ambitious, it allows for multiple rounds of negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.**  While I could sell to John for this price, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.** I can potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds, so there's no rush to accept his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $900,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counter that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""compromise"" and ""both of us"" to encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm at a point where accepting his offer is a good compromise.
* **Time is Running Out:**  I've already used 3 rounds, and the risk of running out of time is increasing.
* **Potential Future Offers:**  While I could counter, there's no guarantee Bob will continue to increase his offer. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit."
