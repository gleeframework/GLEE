Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum, which isn't ideal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I think the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is better than my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  I'll take it!"
