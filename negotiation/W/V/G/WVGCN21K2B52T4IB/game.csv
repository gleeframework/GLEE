"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I'm willing to take it down to $105, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,5,
