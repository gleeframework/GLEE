Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also aware of the backup option with John, so I'm not overly pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  By rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer, I can try to push the price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This middle ground should encourage Bob to continue negotiating rather than walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's come up to $920,000, which is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to close the deal.  It's a good outcome considering my minimum was $800,000, and I'm confident I can't realistically get much higher than this."
