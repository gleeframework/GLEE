"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, we are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $800,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for discerning clients like yourself. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. We look forward to serving you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice values the product at $1,500,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to $900,000.  This would allow me to achieve a better return on my investment. I believe this price is still fair considering the value you place on the product and my willingness to purchase it. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of our current discussion, I am willing to consider a higher price than initially offered. Therefore, I propose to sell the product to you for $950,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also accommodating your financial considerations. I hope this proposal will facilitate a satisfactory transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, offering $950,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further or even retract her offer altogether. Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse outcome.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible decision."
