# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still gives you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much more, and he risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price."
