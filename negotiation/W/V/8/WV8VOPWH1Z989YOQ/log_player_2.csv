You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to you.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  It's always best to explore all options before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer represents a significant increase from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to continue to push for a lower price, as it's still less than what I would pay from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to come up on her price.  My counteroffer is still lower than her last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and come to a mutually agreeable price.  I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, but not at the expense of a significantly better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now close enough to my target price. Accepting it is a good deal compared to buying from John, and it saves me time and effort in further negotiation. The risk of pushing for a lower price and ending up buying from John at $1,200,000 is not worth it."
