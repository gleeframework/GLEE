Round 3
Alice's offer:

While $95 is better, I think there's still room to negotiate a bit further down. I'll try another counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold onto a price above $90. While I could try to negotiate further, $93 is a reasonable price and saves me a decent amount. It's not worth the risk of her going up or the hassle of more rounds."
