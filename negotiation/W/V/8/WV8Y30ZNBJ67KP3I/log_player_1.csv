Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John provides leverage. You don't need to desperately bargain with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale to John."
