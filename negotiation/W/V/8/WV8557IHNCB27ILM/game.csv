"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for a price closer to $900,000.  What are your thoughts on that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $1,900,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I've been giving your offer serious thought. To be completely transparent, $1,100,000 falls short of what I had in mind. However, I value your interest and the potential for us to make a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made, but we're still quite far apart on price.  Frankly, I'm considering other options that align better with my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $1,200,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider those alternatives.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're exploring other options, but I'm confident this product offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to move up to $1,400,000, I'm ready to finalize the deal today.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my price limit. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,250,000.  This is my absolute best, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
