"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, even if it takes a few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for a price closer to $900,000.  What are your thoughts on that?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $1,900,000 is still much higher than your ideal price and what John is offering. Continuing to negotiate is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $1,900,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I've been giving your offer serious thought. To be completely transparent, $1,100,000 falls short of what I had in mind. However, I value your interest and the potential for us to make a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is making concessions, but the price is still far too high. We need to show her we're serious about a much lower price point. It's time to significantly increase the pressure by moving closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement you've made, but we're still quite far apart on price.  Frankly, I'm considering other options that align better with my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $1,200,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider those alternatives."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Stronger Language:** The message is more direct and firm about the price disparity and alternative options. 
* **Clear Ultimatum:** Offering a ""take it or leave it"" price of $1,200,000 introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Walk-Away Credibility:** Mentioning other options isn't an empty threat â€“ John's offer is a real alternative. 

This approach aims to either get Alice to seriously reconsider her position or to make it clear that walking away is a real possibility for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're exploring other options, but I'm confident this product offers unique value that you won't find elsewhere. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to move up to $1,400,000, I'm ready to finalize the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than your target. You've successfully moved her down from her initial offer, and there are still a few rounds left to negotiate. Now is the time to hold firm and see if you can get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my price limit. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,250,000.  This is my absolute best, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  This creates a sense of urgency and implies that you're close to walking away.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving up to $1,250,000 shows willingness to compromise but maintains a firm stance.
* **Direct Appeal for Decision:**  Asking for her thoughts directly puts the ball in her court and encourages a prompt response.

At this point, you've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, but you've also set a clear boundary. Alice now needs to decide if selling the product to you at this price is worthwhile."
