Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a high initial price, but signals a willingness to negotiate. It's important to remember that we have 10 rounds and a backup buyer, so we don't need to rush into a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below our minimum threshold of $120.  While we want to close the deal, we're in a strong position.  We have 8 rounds left and a guaranteed buyer in John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to counter with a price closer to our desired value."

Round 3

```

**Explanation:**

We are sticking to our minimum threshold of $120 and offering a counteroffer slightly higher.  This maintains our stance and leaves room for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $118 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum threshold, it's still below $120. We have 6 rounds remaining and a guaranteed buyer in John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to counter with a price closer to our desired value and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there.  How about $122?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 122} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are continuing to inch closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a price above our minimum threshold.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while keeping our value in mind. We have 5 rounds remaining, and the pressure is starting to mount, so this is a calculated compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $122 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $119 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $119
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now just $1 away from our minimum threshold, we are at a critical juncture. We have only 4 rounds left.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob continuing to push for a lower price, selling to John for $120 is the most secure option. This guarantees our minimum price and eliminates the risk of ending the negotiation with a lower offer."
