"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget ($1,200,000). It's worth exploring the negotiation further to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a negotiating range and allows me to explore a price that is closer to my budget.
* My message is polite and professional, keeping the negotiation open and collaborative. 
* I'm leaving room for further negotiation. By saying ""Let me know if you're open to negotiating further,"" I'm inviting Alice to propose a counteroffer and continue the conversation."
