Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's also the same amount I can get from John, so there's no benefit to continuing negotiations."
