Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate.

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice has come down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than my budget.  I'd rather buy from John and get the product for $8,000."
