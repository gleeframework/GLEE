"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and pay $9,250 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
