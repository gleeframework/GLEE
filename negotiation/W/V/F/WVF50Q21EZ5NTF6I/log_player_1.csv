{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, especially considering its potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to my $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and we might settle somewhere above his $800,000 valuation.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy it for my asking price gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below a certain point. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique benefits"" and ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the value, potentially pushing him closer to my price."
