"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $14,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value it brings.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $11,000 is still lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $11,750. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,750, which would be $11,375. Can we meet at this price?",11375.0,Bob,6,
