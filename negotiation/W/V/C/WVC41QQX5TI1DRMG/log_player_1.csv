"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and the product's value to him.  You have room to negotiate and there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer since you have the backup option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We're coming down from the initial offer but still aiming high to allow room for further negotiation.
* $1,600,000 keeps us significantly above Bob's offer and closer to your desired price and John's offer. 
* This shows a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has increased his offer, but it's still substantially below your minimum and the product's worth to him. There's room for negotiation. We'll continue to guide the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  We've significantly reduced the asking price, demonstrating flexibility.
* $1,350,000 represents a substantial increase from Bob's offer while still leaving you room to negotiate further.
* Presenting it as a ""meeting halfway"" approach can encourage Bob to see it as a balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I could manage $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, as that's the most I can justify spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has now offered his perceived maximum value for the product. Pushing further risks losing the sale.
* **Strong Profit:** While not your ideal price, $1,200,000 is still a significant profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  You've spent several rounds negotiating, and accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged back-and-forth. 
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:** Even if you reject and continue, there's no guarantee of reaching a better price than $1,200,000. 

While selling to John would get you your full desired amount, accepting Bob's offer represents a good deal with a reasonable level of certainty."
