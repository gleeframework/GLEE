"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional at a price that is slightly above its cost to me but still below its perceived value to you. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
