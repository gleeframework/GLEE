"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get a better deal than $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This demonstrates your intent to buy the product but also your willingness to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and significantly less than John's price.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower price is balanced by the potential for the negotiations to fail and you needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids further potential complications."
