"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to try and get closer to a price that's more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Anchoring:**  By anchoring my first offer low, I'm hoping to influence Alice's perception of what's a reasonable price during the negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** I haven't revealed my alternative option with John. Knowing I can get the product for $8,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not there yet:** Alice meeting halfway is a good sign, showing she's willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still $1,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a decent chance Alice might come down a bit more, especially since I was quite aggressive in the previous round. 

Let's see if we can get closer to that $8,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference (again):** By suggesting $7,500, I'm again meeting Alice halfway between her current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000). This shows a willingness to compromise but also keeps moving the price in the right direction.
* **Nearing my limit:** I'm getting closer to my walk-away point of $8,000 (John's offer). Alice needs to make a significant move in the next round if she wants to secure the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the limit:** Alice is firm at $8,500, and while it's a good price compared to her initial offer, it's still higher than John's $8,000. 
* **No guarantee of further compromise:**  Alice has signaled that this is her final offer (""as low as I'm willing to go"").  
* **Time to switch:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and there's always a risk Alice could hold firm. It's more strategic to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
