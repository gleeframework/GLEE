"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that cost. I could consider a price closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
