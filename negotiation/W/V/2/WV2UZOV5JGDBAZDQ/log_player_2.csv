Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we start around $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant price reduction. My final offer is $1,150,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the product's value.  I need a decision from you this round - if we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and has given you an ultimatum. While $1,150,000 is closer to your ideal price, you have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000.  

At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice outweighs the potential savings. She's signaled she might not budge further, and you could end up empty-handed. It's a better strategy to take the guaranteed deal with John."
