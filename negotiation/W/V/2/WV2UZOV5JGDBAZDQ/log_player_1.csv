"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for our discussion"" signals my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more receptive to engaging in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we start around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  While I want to negotiate, I need to steer the conversation towards a more reasonable range.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Refuting:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating that it's too low. 
* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** I make a $150,000 reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility but staying well above my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Mutually Beneficial:** This framing encourages Bob to view the negotiation as a collaborative process rather than a win-lose situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that makes sense for me. $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer.  I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to potentially accepting John's offer if the gap isn't bridged soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant price reduction. My final offer is $1,150,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the product's value.  I need a decision from you this round - if we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm boundary by stating my ""final offer"" and ""absolute limit."" This emphasizes that I'm serious and won't go lower.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that my offer is fair based on the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake.
* **Introducing a Deadline:** By saying I need a decision this round, I'm injecting a sense of urgency and signaling that I have an alternative (John) if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** By offering $1,150,000, I'm giving Bob one last chance to secure a deal that's still significantly better than his current offer while also ensuring I'm above my minimum."
