"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we start around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, reflecting my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that makes sense for me. $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant price reduction. My final offer is $1,150,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the product's value.  I need a decision from you this round - if we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
