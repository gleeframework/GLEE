"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims to secure a price closer to my initial target.  It should also be attractive to Bob, as it's only $50,000 less than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer and see if I can secure a deal closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $900,000. This is a firm price point for me, and I believe it's fair given Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's also a good compromise and likely to be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. 

Bob has become increasingly unwilling to budge from his lower price point, and we've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing time and potentially a sale.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal far below my target."
