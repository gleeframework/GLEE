"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I believe $900,000 is a fair price that's in both our interests. It gives you a substantial profit while keeping the deal within my reach. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while to sell the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
