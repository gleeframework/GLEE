{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin.  I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am getting closer to her price point. However, I'm still below my personal maximum of $10,000.  I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, Alice will be more motivated to reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $15,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $10,000. We're nearing the end of negotiations, and I'm hoping to get a price I'm more comfortable with. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:** This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to pay more, but still within my budget.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** This is the final round of negotiations with Alice, and her offer is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate, as I might not get a better price.  Therefore, I will accept John's offer of $10,000 to ensure I get the product at my desired price."
