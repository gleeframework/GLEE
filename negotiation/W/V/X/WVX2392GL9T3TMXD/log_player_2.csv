"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product for $1,600,000.  I understand it's worth that much to you, and I believe this price is fair given the potential value you'll realize.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for the product.  Alice's offer is $1,600,000, which is more than you're willing to spend.  Since you can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead."
