,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $135? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I can see you're serious about this product, so I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $130? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to accepting, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $126?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $128, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",128.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $124, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",124.0,Bob,10,
