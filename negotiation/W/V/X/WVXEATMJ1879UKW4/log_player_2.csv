"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to make it to you because of our initial conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* However, you know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000. This means there's room for negotiation with Alice. 
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and encourage her to potentially come down closer to her $800,000 valuation."
