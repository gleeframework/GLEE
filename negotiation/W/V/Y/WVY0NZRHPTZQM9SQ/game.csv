"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really looking to stay at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
