"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really looking to stay at $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
