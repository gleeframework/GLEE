Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob, which could incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's still profitable, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and I can likely get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows for a substantial profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and provides a reasonable profit."
