Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive to him while still being profitable for herself. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

**This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price beneficial to Alice.**"
