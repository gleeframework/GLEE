"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the potential value it holds for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal with you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
