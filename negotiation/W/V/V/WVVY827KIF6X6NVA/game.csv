"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 doesn't reflect the product's full value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,050,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I consider fair.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay that price.  I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
