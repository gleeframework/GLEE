Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to get Bob to pay as close to his maximum value ($1,200,000) as possible, without losing him to a rejection.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** We're starting at $150,000 above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions you as offering a good deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""return on investment for your specific needs,"" we subtly anchor the price to its potential value for Bob, not just its market worth.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a less aggressive opening price might be wise.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have the security of John's offer, giving you a strong position."
