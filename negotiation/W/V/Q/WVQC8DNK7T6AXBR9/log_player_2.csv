"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's actually more than your absolute limit. You should definitely counter-offer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is framed politely and acknowledges the product's value while emphasizing my budget constraints.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to bring the negotiation closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price as it's still below its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice meeting in the middle is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth countering again to see if you can get closer to $12,000. You can always buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something within a tighter budget. Would you be open to $11,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm very interested in the product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but not dramatically. This shows Alice I'm serious but still holding onto my budget.
* **Justification:**  I'm emphasizing that this is already a big purchase for me, making the request for a lower price feel more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving some space between my offer ($11,000) and my absolute limit ($12,000) in case Alice counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, $11,000 is still below its value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's drawn a line in the sand at $13,000.  While you might be able to push her a tiny bit further, it's unlikely she'll go as low as $12,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the sure thing."
