``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This allows room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers and am willing to negotiate, but I have a backup plan with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I show Bob I'm serious about getting my desired price.
* **Continue negotiations:** I can now make a counteroffer, potentially closing the gap and securing a better deal.
* **Secure the deal with John:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John at my minimum price."
