"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to negotiate up to around $14,000 or so.  It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $14,000, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum of $15,000 by continuing negotiations.  The risk of selling to John for $15,000 is always there, but I'm willing to gamble for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but still want to maximize my profits.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum,  I'm still hopeful of getting a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $15,500. This is getting very close to my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, as I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still hopeful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end, and Bob's offers are still too low.  I'm running out of time and want to guarantee myself a good profit.  John is a safe bet at $15,000, and I'm going to take that offer."
