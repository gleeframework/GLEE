"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $145 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and even less than our max budget. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away. Expressing interest while countering keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **Strategic:** This offer is close to Alice's value of the product ($120). If she's eager to sell, she might accept. If not, we can still negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, $110 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $130 is still above our target price. We have room to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $120? That seems fair to both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** We're moving closer to Alice's price to show willingness to compromise.
* **Targeting Her Value:** Offering $120 directly targets her known value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go lower, but it gives her a chance to sell at her desired price.
* **John as Backup:** We're still below our max budget and have John's offer if negotiations break down."
