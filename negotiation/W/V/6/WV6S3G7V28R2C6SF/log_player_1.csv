Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation if he decides to counteroffer. It also sets a high initial price point, making it more likely that Bob will accept a lower price in a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This gives you a good deal and lets me make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get $150, Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. I'll accept his offer and sell him the product."
