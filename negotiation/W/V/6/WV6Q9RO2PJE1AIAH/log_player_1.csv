Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to part with it for $135. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible while still ensuring a sale.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since we have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $120, we can afford to be slightly bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
