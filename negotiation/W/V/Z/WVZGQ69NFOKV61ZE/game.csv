"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a considerable amount to me, at least $1,000,000, and I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to me, while also being a fair compromise. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being a good compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to drop below $1,250,000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part and would still allow you a substantial return on your investment. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
