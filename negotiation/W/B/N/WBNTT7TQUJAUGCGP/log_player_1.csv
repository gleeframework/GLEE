"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This allows for potential negotiation room while ensuring I start with a price that reflects the minimum value I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a fair price that still allows for some profit for me, but it's also closer to what Bob seems willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not confident that we'll reach a better price with him. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and saves me further negotiation time."
