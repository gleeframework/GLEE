"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might prompt her to make a lower offer, closer to her product's value of $100. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
