Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. My next offer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your target.  Rejecting the offer allows for another round of negotiation, and there's a good chance you can get a better price without having to resort to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,065,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next offer is $1,070,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is very close to your target price of $1,050,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to lower her price further.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a good price without risking having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
