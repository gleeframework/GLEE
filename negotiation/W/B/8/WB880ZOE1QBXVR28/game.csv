"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000 for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would still be a great profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1,050,000. My next offer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,065,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next offer is $1,070,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
