"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875000. I believe the product's value is worth a premium, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $860000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $860000 fully captures the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking more along the lines of $880000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $860000. I'm willing to go up to $870000, which is a significant step towards your offer. We're getting closer, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking $885000 is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,7,
