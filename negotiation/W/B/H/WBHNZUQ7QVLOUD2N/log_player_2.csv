"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down to $1,125,000, it's still higher than his desired price and potentially could continue to drop lower. However, he's already been through multiple rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Alice won't budge further.  John is offering the product at Bob's maximum, so it's the best option to secure the product without further risk."
