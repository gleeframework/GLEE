"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I can easily secure it from another seller for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into preparing it for sale. I'm confident that you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable addition to my business.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
