Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $99.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. It's unlikely he'll accept a price much higher knowing someone else is willing to buy it at $100.

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob without risking losing the sale to John."
