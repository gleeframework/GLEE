"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're aiming to get the price lower, and $95 is too close to our fallback option of buying from John. It's time to haggle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I think it's pretty good, but $95 feels a bit steep. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and our fallback of $100. Starting with a low counter-offer of $70 gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and frame the counter-offer as reasonable rather than confrontational. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $70 is too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but room to negotiate:** Alice moved from $95 to $85, which is a good sign that we can negotiate a better price. We're getting closer to her value of $80, but we still have some wiggle room.
* **Staying below John's price:**  We want to ensure we get a better deal than John's offer of $100. Accepting $85 wouldn't achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle at $78?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but keeping it significantly below $85 to signal that we're still looking for a better deal.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  $78 puts us closer to Alice's likely minimum acceptable price while still giving us some room to negotiate if needed.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  The message continues to be respectful and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $78 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $83, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** Alice explicitly stated this is her ""final offer,"" implying she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Acceptable Price:** While not ideal, $83 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly cheaper than John's offer of $100 and close enough to Alice's likely minimum.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could make Alice walk away, forcing us to take the less favorable deal from John."
