"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm not sure what Bob's budget is, but I'm confident this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to him.  This gives us room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me.  It's worth more than that to me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I still have rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for profit and is closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is a fair price, and I'm not sure I can negotiate much higher with him. It's also the same price as John's offer, so I'm not losing out on any money by taking this deal."
