"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair compromise. If you're open to that, let's make a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit out of your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $100. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident that this is the best price I can offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
