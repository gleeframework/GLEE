"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $17,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:** I'm setting a high price to see if I can maximize my profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While I'm aiming for the best price possible with Bob, John's $15,000 offer is my fallback option. If negotiations with Bob don't go well, I'll need to make a decision based on the offers and the remaining rounds. 
* **Bob's Response:**  I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's interested but wants a lower price, I'll need to decide if I can meet him halfway or if I'm better off moving to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is still on the table, acting as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's more reasonable than his $11,000 offer but still within the range that I'm comfortable with. I'll aim for a price that's closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  Would you consider $15,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $15,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fair Value:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair and reflects the product's value.
* **Building Agreement:** I'm framing my counteroffer in a positive light, highlighting the potential for reaching a mutual agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is still my backup plan if I can't reach a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Bob's Response:**  I'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he's still not willing to budge, I might need to reconsider my position and move closer to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my $15,000 target.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, suggesting there might be room for a higher counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 remains a solid option if I can't get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $15,000, but still within a reasonable range that might encourage him to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $14,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm offering $14,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $15,500 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fair Value:** I'm again emphasizing the fair value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob that this price is reasonable.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the potential for reaching a deal to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob, I'm still aware of John's offer of $15,000 and will consider it if Bob's final offer isn't acceptable.
* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer to determine my next move. If he's still unwilling to budge, I may have to make a decision based on the remaining rounds and the potential of closing a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $13,500, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still below my target.
* **Few Rounds Left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic. Accepting this offer would leave me with a smaller profit. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 remains a viable option, especially since Bob's counteroffers are still below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired $15,000, but I'll need to weigh the potential for reaching a deal with Bob against the guaranteed $15,000 from John. The remaining rounds are crucial for making a decision that maximizes my profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  Would you consider $14,250?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Higher:** I'm offering $14,250, which is closer to my desired price but still below my previous offer of $14,500. This shows continued negotiation and flexibility.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both parties.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a balance between negotiating a higher price and closing a deal before time runs out.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is still a strong option, especially with few rounds left. I need to carefully consider if I can secure a better price with Bob or if it's safer to accept John's offer. 
* **Bob's Response:** I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer to determine my next move. If he's still unwilling to budge, I'll have to make a difficult decision about whether to accept his offer or move on to John."

Bob's offer:

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $13,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $15,000 guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement.

**Decision:**

Given the limited time and the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better result."
