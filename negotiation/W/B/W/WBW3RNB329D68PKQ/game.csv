"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's split the difference. How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
