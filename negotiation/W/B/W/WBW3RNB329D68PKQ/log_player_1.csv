Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm  prepared for Bob to counteroffer. This strategy allows me to potentially get a better price than $1,000,000 but still secures a decent profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows that he's willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a secure backup option with John, so I can afford to be patient and try to improve the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price of $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both of us. This appeals to Bob's sense of reason and potentially makes the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving room for further negotiation, as $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to:

*  Continue negotiation to potentially get a better price closer to my desired $1,200,000.
* Maintain a good relationship with Bob, showing willingness to compromise.
*  Keep the possibility of selling to John as a backup plan, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's split the difference. How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $900,000 is only $300,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Compromise and Finality:** Bob is offering a compromise that is relatively close to my ideal price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal and move on. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Bob will walk away or further reduce his offer. Accepting this deal guarantees a sale close to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm comfortable with this offer because I know I have a guaranteed buyer in John, providing me with a solid safety net."
