"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, you can likely get a better price.  You can counteroffer and try to get closer to your target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing.  Accepting $7,250 saves you $750 compared to buying from John, and it's likely a good compromise."
