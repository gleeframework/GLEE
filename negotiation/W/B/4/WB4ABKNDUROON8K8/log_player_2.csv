You should still reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above your budget. Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

You should counteroffer with $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise between your previous offer and Alice's offer. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept this price."

Alice is not budging much, and the negotiation is getting tedious.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer from John and buy the product for $800,000."
