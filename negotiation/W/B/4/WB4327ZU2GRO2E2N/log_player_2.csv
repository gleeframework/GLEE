"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the price of $140. I believe this product would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While the product is worth $150 to you, you want to save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffers are possible.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise, as it's closer to your initial counteroffer of $130.
* **Time is a factor:**  You have only 10 rounds to negotiate.  Accepting this offer is likely the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price within the time limit.
* **Avoiding John:**  While John is an option, buying from Alice at $135 saves you $15."
