Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but still leaves me with a profit.  By offering a price that is closer to Bob's valuation, I increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

If he rejects it, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and see if it makes sense to continue negotiating or if it's better to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, my goal is to maximize profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to consider if it's worth continuing negotiations with Bob or if it's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
