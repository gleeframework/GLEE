"Alice, your product is fantastic, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a significant discount from the original price, but still reflects the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also reflecting my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $1075000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and it's a compromise that I'm comfortable with.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
