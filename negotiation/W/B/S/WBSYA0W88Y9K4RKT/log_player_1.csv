"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
