Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. This allows for negotiation room while still maximizing my potential profit. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to meet him halfway, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering $10,500, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with his compromise. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sacrifice too much of my desired profit. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and closer to your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This counteroffer demonstrates further willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above my minimum. It's a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before considering John's offer."
