"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering its worth to you is $1000000.
