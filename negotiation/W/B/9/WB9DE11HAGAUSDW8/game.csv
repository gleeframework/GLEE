"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high. I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's the maximum I'm comfortable spending.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is closer to the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While $12,000 is still below what I'd like, I'm willing to accept $14,500. This is a very competitive offer and a fair compromise.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $14,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
