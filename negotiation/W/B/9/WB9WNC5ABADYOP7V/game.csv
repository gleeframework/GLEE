"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While the product is valuable to me, I'm not quite ready to pay $950,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, offering $875,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more move to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your latest offer of $875,000, I'm willing to reduce my price to $887,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
