"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my maximum, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for further negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for $900,000 yet. I will try to push for a lower price before considering John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, offering $875,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more move to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your latest offer of $875,000, I'm willing to reduce my price to $887,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a fair compromise. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer and very close to my counteroffer of $875,000.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing me to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high. It's a good deal, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
