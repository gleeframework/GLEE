"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much better price.  I'll aim to get closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than my actual limit. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a great deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  By offering $10,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying but need a much lower price. It opens the door for Alice to counter. 
* **Alternative:**  It's important to keep John's offer in mind. If Alice isn't willing to come down significantly in price, I can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This product offers significant value, and I believe this revised price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice's price is getting closer, but it's still significantly above my $12,000 limit. I can get a better deal.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  The fact that Alice came down in price shows she's willing to negotiate. There's room to move further.
* **John as Leverage:** John's standing offer of $12,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate and can walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,500? I think that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $13,500, I'm aiming for roughly the midpoint between her last offer ($17,000) and my previous offer ($10,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving significantly closer to my target.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above my $12,000 limit, giving me a small buffer if Alice counters. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm compromising, I'm still a good distance from accepting her last offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice to continue negotiating."
