"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident its true value is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
