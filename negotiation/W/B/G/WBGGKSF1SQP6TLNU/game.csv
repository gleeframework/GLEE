"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",812500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",780000.0,Bob,4,
