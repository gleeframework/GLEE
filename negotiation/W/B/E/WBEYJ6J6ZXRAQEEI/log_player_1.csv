Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is still above my minimum value, and hopefully, it's more appealing to Bob while still allowing for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not motivated to continue negotiating.  John is offering the same price, and I'd rather sell to him and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
