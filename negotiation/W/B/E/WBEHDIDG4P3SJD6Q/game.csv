"Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident I can find another buyer who will recognize its value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise that still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
