Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Profit:**  We aim to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to still secure a price higher than $12,000.
* **Stronger Position Than John:** Bob is clearly a more desirable buyer than John, who represents your fallback option."
