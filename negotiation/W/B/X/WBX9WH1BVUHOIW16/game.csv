"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I could potentially go up to $725,000. If that works for you, let me know!",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $725,000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
