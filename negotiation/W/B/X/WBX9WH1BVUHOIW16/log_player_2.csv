# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $725,000, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than your absolute limit. John offers a guaranteed way to stay within your budget.  There's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
