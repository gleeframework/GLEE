Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000.  I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,300,000) significantly increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a substantial profit for you ($500,000 above your minimum).

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay a premium. 
* You could potentially start with a higher offer and negotiate down, but this risks alienating Bob and pushing him towards rejecting the deal outright."
