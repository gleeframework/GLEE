"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, and I'm ready to close the deal if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to invest less, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
