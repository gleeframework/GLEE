"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  I can potentially get the product for less than that by making a counteroffer.  It's risky to buy from John immediately because it's the most expensive option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to invest less, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I can still try to get it for less.  $1,150,000 is still a significant investment, and I'm not ready to commit to that yet. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice has made it clear that $1,125,000 is her bottom line.  At this price, I'm still getting a good deal compared to buying from John, and I'm confident the product will be worth the investment.  It's time to close the deal."
