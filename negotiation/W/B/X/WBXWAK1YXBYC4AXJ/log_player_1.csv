Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and a good profit for me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $13000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next rounds, and I risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer now secures a good profit and avoids potential risks."
