Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000),** giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value ($1,500,000),** leaving room for negotiation and ensuring you profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It frames the offer as fair and invites Bob to discuss further. 

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, you've made a good deal.
* **Start a negotiation:** If he rejects, you can use his counteroffer to understand his willingness to pay and adjust your offer accordingly.
* **Have a backup:** Knowing you can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage throughout the negotiation."
