{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** The price is still above the value to Bob ($8,000) which increases the chance he'll accept, but also allows for potential counteroffers.
* **Flexibility:**  By starting high, I have room to adjust my price if necessary. I can still make a profit even if I have to lower the price. 
* **Potential for a Quick Deal:**  A higher initial offer could motivate Bob to accept quickly, saving time and effort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to take a significant loss on this product.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, or even get closer to my desired $10,000.
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price provides leverage in the negotiation.

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer again if necessary, while still maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $10,000 mark. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed that we will reach an agreement.
* **John's guaranteed offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's more efficient and reliable to close the deal with him.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure a quick and profitable sale."
