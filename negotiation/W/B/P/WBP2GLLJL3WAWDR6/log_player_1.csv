Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away if needed to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm countering with $16,500. This is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $15,000, and it's closer to my ideal price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
