{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good deal for myself while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still looking to get closer to $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come up a little to $9,500? It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your target, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my target price and it's better than selling to John. Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for me and avoids further negotiation."
