Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and aim to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This should encourage him to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still less than my desired price, it's closer to my minimum value and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from Bob. It's also a quicker sale than going through another round of negotiations."
