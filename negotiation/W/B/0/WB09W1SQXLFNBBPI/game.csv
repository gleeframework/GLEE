"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
