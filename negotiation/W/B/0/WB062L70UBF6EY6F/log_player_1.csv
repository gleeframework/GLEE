Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, his insistence on $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm not comfortable accepting that price, and it's clear he's not willing to budge.  Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  It's the best outcome for me in this situation."
