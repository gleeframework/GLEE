"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit further to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to that amount.",8000.0,Bob,4,
