Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $12,000, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already had enough back and forth, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get him to budge further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  He's a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with."
