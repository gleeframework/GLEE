"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. Would you consider $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but we're still quite far apart.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I wouldn't be comfortable going below $1,025,000.  This feels like a reasonable offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Would you consider $995,000?",995000.0,Bob,6,
