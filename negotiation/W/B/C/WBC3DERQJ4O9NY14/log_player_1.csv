Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. Would you consider $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay significantly more than our fallback option of John ($1,000,000). We're still early in the negotiation, and consistently rejecting his lowball offers might push him closer to the $1,000,000 mark."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but we're still quite far apart.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I wouldn't be comfortable going below $1,025,000.  This feels like a reasonable offer considering the benefits you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Would you consider $995,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push Bob a little further, the difference at this point is relatively small. Accepting $995,000 is a significant gain over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob potentially lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
