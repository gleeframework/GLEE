"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise that should be more in line with your budget while still allowing me to get a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$13,500 is still higher than your budget. You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.  It's worth trying a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $13,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference and try $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I've already compromised with my previous offer of $13,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already rejected two of her counteroffers.  You've shown your willingness to negotiate, but there's a risk of going back and forth with Alice for another 5 rounds and still not reaching an agreeable price.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000."
