"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise that should be more in line with your budget while still allowing me to get a good price for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $13,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference and try $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I've already compromised with my previous offer of $13,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
