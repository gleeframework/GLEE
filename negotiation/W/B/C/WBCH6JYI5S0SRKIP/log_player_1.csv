Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500.

This is a fair compromise that should be more in line with your budget while still allowing me to get a good price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
