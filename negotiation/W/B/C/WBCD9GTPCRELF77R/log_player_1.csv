Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,500. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more and I have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price considering the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $10,875, which would be $10,812.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,812.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,812.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's only $187.50 less than my last counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer completely. Accepting his offer will ensure I get a good profit, and I'm running out of rounds."
