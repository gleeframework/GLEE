"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price considering the value you've placed on the product.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $10,875, which would be $10,812.50. Can you consider that?",10812.5,Bob,6,
