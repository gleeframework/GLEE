"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. Would that be something you'd be comfortable with?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500. How about we try $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
