"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still leaves you with a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,500, which would be $11,250. This is a fair price that still leaves room for a good profit, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's closer to your desired amount, but still allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
