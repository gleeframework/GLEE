"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and there's a good chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $10,750?  This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try 11200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now offering $11,200, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. At this point, Bob should realize that he's unlikely to get the product from Alice for a price he's comfortable with.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation and Alice is unwilling to budge much further. It's better to cut his losses and buy from John, who's offering the product for $10,000, within Bob's budget."
