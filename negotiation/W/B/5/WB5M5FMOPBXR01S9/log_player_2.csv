# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount and a chance to acquire a product that will make a real difference.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, it's lower than John's asking price.
* **Saving money is the goal:**  You want to save as much as possible, and accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
