"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant premium, but I believe it's within the realm of reason considering the product's value to Bob.  This allows for some negotiation room, but still sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for higher.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1675000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,675,000. This is a compromise from my initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's fair considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
