```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $950,000, which is still less than your maximum price.
* However, you can get the product from John for $1,000,000. 
* Since you want to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even though it means paying a slightly higher price."
