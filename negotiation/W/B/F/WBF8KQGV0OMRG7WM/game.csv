"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While I think $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
