"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16000 for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $15500. It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're willing to pay $15500, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to offer you a price of $16250 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to keep working towards a deal, but $16250 is still beyond my budget. How about $15750? It's a fair price and shows we're both trying to find common ground. Let's get this done.",15750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering you a price of $16000, which is the same as my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
