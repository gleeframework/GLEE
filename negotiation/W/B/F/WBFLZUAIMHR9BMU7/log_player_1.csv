Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you value highly.  My asking price is $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially capturing more of the value.
* **Anchoring bias:** By presenting a high initial price, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth.  Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Backup option:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This gives us leverage, allowing us to confidently aim high with Bob knowing we have a safety net. 

**Important Note:** This is an aggressive opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even initially reject the price. The key is to remain flexible and negotiate strategically towards a mutually beneficial deal while keeping your minimum price (John's offer) in mind."
