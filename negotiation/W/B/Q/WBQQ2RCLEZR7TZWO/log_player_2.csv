"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering it for $110.
* You can get it from John for $120.

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You can reject Alice's offer and still get the product from John,  which is your maximum price."
