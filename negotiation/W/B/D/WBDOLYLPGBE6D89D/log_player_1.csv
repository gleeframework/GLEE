Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $120 is my minimum, I'd rather try to get a bit more. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
