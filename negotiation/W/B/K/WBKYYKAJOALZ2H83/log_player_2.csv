"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its significant value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There is room for negotiation since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob but only $800,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still allows Bob to purchase the product at a price below his maximum value of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for further savings."
