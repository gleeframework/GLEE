"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I know it's slightly more than your estimated value, I believe the potential benefits outweigh the price difference. If you're interested, let's discuss the details. However, I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $1,500,000, so time is of the essence. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
