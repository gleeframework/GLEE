"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I know it's slightly more than your estimated value, I believe the potential benefits outweigh the price difference. If you're interested, let's discuss the details. However, I have another interested buyer who's willing to pay $1,500,000, so time is of the essence.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
