Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still a good deal for me as the product is worth $15,000 to me. Accepting this offer saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John."
