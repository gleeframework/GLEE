"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not even close to the value Bob places on the product. There's no point in accepting this offer.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've already received interest from other potential buyers at a much higher price point. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above Bob's budget.  At this point, Bob has two good options: 

* **Negotiate further:**  He can continue to counteroffer, hoping to get the price closer to his target.
* **Go with John:** Bob has a guaranteed deal with John at $1,200,000.  He can always choose this option if negotiations with Alice stall or become too difficult. 

Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product.  I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still below my initial expectations, I value our developing business relationship. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other interested parties if we can't agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,625,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's closer to her perceived value than Bob's. However, Bob has a few things going for him:

* **John's offer:**  He has a guaranteed backup option with John at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, but she's already shown willingness to negotiate. 
* **Limited rounds:** Bob only has 5 rounds left.  He needs to be strategic and avoid rushing into a deal.

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice, potentially getting a better price, without risking missing out on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and understand your need to consider other offers. However, $1,625,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair and mutually beneficial price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
