"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've already received interest from other potential buyers at a much higher price point. However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range. I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product.  I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still below my initial expectations, I value our developing business relationship. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other interested parties if we can't agree on this.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and understand your need to consider other offers. However, $1,625,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that $1,500,000 is a fair and mutually beneficial price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product. It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
