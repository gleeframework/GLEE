"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I can offer you a compromise at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
