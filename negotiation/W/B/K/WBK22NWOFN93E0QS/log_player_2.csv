# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can consider a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I can offer you a compromise at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 than risk Alice sticking to her current offer."
