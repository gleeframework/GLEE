"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the value of the product. This is my best offer, let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise - I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're also making a significant investment, but $975,000 is still below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
