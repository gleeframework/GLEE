Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
