Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but it's still a considerable discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This allows some room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,550,000, which is still a reasonable compromise considering my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than my previous counteroffer.  There's a clear impasse, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating down further.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiation."
