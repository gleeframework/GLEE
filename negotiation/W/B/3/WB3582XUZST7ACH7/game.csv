"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is still a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $13,300. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John instead.",13300.0,Alice,7,
