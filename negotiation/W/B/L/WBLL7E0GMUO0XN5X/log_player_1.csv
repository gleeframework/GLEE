"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows for room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get even more, I'm concerned that pushing for a higher price might risk losing the deal altogether. At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best option, as I still get a significant profit and avoid the risk of having to settle for John's lower offer."
