Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
