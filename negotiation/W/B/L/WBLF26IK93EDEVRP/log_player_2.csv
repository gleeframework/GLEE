"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $9,000 is still under Bob's $10,000 limit and closer to his desired price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in Alice becoming less willing to sell or even raising the price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Time spent negotiating is time Bob could be using to use the product. 

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and minimizes the risk of losing the deal or needing to pay more."
