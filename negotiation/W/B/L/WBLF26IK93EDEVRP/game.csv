"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the condition of the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
