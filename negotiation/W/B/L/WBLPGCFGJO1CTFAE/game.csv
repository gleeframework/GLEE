"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, even slightly below your estimated value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
