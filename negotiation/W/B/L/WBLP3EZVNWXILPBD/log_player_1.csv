Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product brings. Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's also the price John is offering.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for me. While it's not my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate."
