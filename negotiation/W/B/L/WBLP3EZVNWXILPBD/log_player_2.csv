"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's potential to negotiate a better price, and John is also a viable option. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better deals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. $950,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiations. This offer is aggressive but not unreasonable, potentially encouraging Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product brings. Let's work towards an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of Bob's ideal price range.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer keeps Bob in a strong negotiating position.  There's potential to get the price closer to his budget by counter-offering, especially as Alice has already shown a willingness to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it's also the price John is offering.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing his negotiation to the limit, matching John's offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting the product and that she risks losing the deal to John. The message emphasizes the value Bob sees in the product, potentially swaying Alice's decision."
