"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, your starting price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and gives us both room to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $1,450,000. This offer reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,450,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to both potentially walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
