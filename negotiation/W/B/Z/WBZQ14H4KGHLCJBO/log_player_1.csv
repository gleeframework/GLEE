Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential returns.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his final offer of $950,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
