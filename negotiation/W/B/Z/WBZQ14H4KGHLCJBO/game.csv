"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential returns.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
