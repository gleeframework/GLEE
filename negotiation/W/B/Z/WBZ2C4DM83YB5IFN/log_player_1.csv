"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.  This approach aims to start the negotiation in a way that is appealing to Bob while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and even below his own perceived value. It's important to stand firm in my initial position and not rush into a deal that would leave me significantly underpaid.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 
This counteroffer maintains my commitment to securing a price above my minimum while acknowledging Bob's initial stance. The $1,300,000 price point is a compromise that hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept while still keeping me closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still too low.  I need to push for a better deal. I will continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price point that meets both our needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant compromise. I'm dropping below my desired price, but still above my minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value.  By making this a ""final offer,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
