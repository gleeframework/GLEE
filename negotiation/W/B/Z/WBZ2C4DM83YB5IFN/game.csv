"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
