"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $7,500 right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should again reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The value to Alice is $8,000, and she is willing to accept $9,500.  Bob can likely offer a slightly higher price and still get a deal that saves him a significant amount of money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8800. This is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  He's saving $3,200 compared to buying from John.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better offer from Alice.  It's better to lock in the current offer and save the time and energy of further negotiation."
