"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm happy to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and the product's actual worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement on his part."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's bridge this gap. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the value while ensuring a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While it's getting closer to my range, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm going to push my budget to the limit and offer $950,000. This feels like a realistic price point for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, I'm still in a strong position with John as a backup. I'm willing to play hardball for one more round to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing the deal, I'll come down slightly to $975,000. This is a significant compromise and my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to agree."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $975,000.  It's getting close, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm going to offer $925,000 as my final counteroffer.  This is my absolute limit, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has essentially hit his ceiling and is unlikely to move significantly beyond this point. Holding out for a slightly higher offer from him isn't worth the risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting John's offer guarantees me my desired outcome and avoids further negotiation."
