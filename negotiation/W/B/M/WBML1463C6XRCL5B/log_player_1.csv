Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't quite meet your price of $8,500, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750? That's the lowest I can go.

You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, but I think I can do $8,800. That's the best I can do. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

While Bob's offer of $8,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my minimum price and ensures I get the best possible outcome."
