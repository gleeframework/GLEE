"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $162.50. What do you think?",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $162.50 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my final offer.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $147.50. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",147.5,Alice,5,
