"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but $650,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects its value to you, while also being a good deal for me.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
