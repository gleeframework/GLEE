"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
