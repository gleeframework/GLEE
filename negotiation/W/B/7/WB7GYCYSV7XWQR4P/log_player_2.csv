"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counteroffer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we try to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will give us a better sense of how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, we know we have a long way to go. If she counters with a slightly lower price, it shows more flexibility on her end.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John's offer of $8,000 in our back pocket."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're getting closer, but $9,000 is still above our target price and what John is offering. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious while still staying below her price and our $8,000 alternative.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""ready to close the deal today,"" we're adding a bit of pressure and suggesting that $7,500 is our final offer. This might encourage Alice to accept if she's keen on selling quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're now positioned exactly between her current offer ($9,000) and our previous offer ($6,000). This gives us some room to negotiate further if she rejects this offer but indicates we're willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500. We've negotiated well, but we have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially missing out on John's offer.  We can save $500 by going with John."
