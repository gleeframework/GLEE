"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,180,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,215,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1215000.0,Alice,5,
