"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1350000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1300000, but I'll throw in a small premium service package worth $50000, which brings the total price to $1350000. This is my final concession. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
