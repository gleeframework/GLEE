"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. I believe there's a good chance Bob will counteroffer, giving us a chance to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than my floor price of $12,000, I believe I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I have a few rounds left and  want to maximize my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000, which is still above Bob's initial counteroffer and closer to my initial goal. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a strong position. I believe this compromise will encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I have a few more rounds to go, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $12,500. This is a significant concession but still above my floor price. It demonstrates my willingness to find common ground while also leaving some room for negotiation. With fewer rounds remaining, I want to incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my floor price, and I'm satisfied with that.  Given that we have fewer rounds remaining, accepting his offer ensures I get my desired price without risking losing the deal."
