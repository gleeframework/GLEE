It's too early to buy from John, as Alice's offer is not that far from your limit. It makes sense to try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is still asking for more than my limit, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I still believe we can close the deal at a lower price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
