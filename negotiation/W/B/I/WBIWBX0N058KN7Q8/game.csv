"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's try to find a solution we're both happy with.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still quite large for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000. Let's see if we can find some middle ground here.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still not workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
