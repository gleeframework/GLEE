"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still offers a profit for Alice (as her value is $8,000). This is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still in a better position to negotiate.  Alice is showing some flexibility, and you can likely get a better price than $11,500.  A counteroffer is the best way to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to close the gap between your last offer and Alice's offer.  $10,500 is a reasonable compromise that's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer but also offers a decent profit for her. This will hopefully persuade Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,000, which is still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. While you could continue negotiating and trying to get a lower price, the chances of Alice agreeing to go lower are slim. 

At this point, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price for you, saving you $4,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good balance between getting a good deal and not risking losing the product to another seller."
