Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. Any deal will depend on negotiation tactics.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the stated values, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Room for Negotiation:** Start with a price significantly higher than $1,500,000. This creates the perception that you're aiming high and might be willing to come down. It gives you space to negotiate and potentially secure a price higher than your minimum.

2. **Direct Sale to John:**  Knowing Bob's maximum price is below your minimum, you can bypass negotiation and sell directly to John.

**The Offer**

Here's an example using the ""High Anchor"" strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement, so please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,850,000 sets a strong anchor, signaling the product's high value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language emphasizes ""initially proposing"" and ""finding a mutually beneficial agreement,"" indicating flexibility. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't budge significantly from his $1,200,000, be prepared to sell to John.
* **Listen and Adjust:**  Pay attention to Bob's responses. He might reveal information that helps you tailor your negotiation.
