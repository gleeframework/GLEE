"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for something worth $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but my budget is tighter than I'd like.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Since he has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
