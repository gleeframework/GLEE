"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $800000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $650000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650000 is still below my minimum threshold. Considering the product's unique features and its value to the right buyer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you consider meeting me at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'll offer it to you for $725000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $680000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider $690000?",690000.0,Bob,6,
