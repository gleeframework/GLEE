Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After some thought, I've decided to offer the product to him for $12,000. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but still a decent offer. After considering it, I've decided to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my initial price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 11000}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $11,000. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
