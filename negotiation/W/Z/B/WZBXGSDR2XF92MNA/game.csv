"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for a product of this value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $12000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
