"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'd be happy to meet in the middle at $80. That feels like a fair price to me.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
