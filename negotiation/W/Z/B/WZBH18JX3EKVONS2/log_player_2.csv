"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and appreciative:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Anchor a low price:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation while staying within my budget.
* **Show interest:**  Mentioning the product looks great signals I'm interested in buying if the price is right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my budget, I'll try to negotiate a bit further before settling. There's still room to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'd be happy to meet in the middle at $80. That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and clear:** This offer directly states my desired price, making it clear what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Strong but respectful:** It asserts my position without being aggressive or dismissive of Alice's offer.
* **Final offer (implied):** By framing it as a ""fair price,"" it subtly suggests this is my best offer without explicitly saying so. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible price while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects this offer, I can always fall back on buying from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer you the product for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is only $5 more than my ideal price from John.  

* **Minimal savings:**  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a significant discount. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead her to walk away. 

It's a reasonable compromise to secure the product at a slightly lower price than Alice's initial offer."
