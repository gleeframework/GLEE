Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm holding out for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  How about $11,500?  I'm willing to be flexible, but that's my best offer at this stage."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm holding out for a better deal, hoping to close at a price closer to $11,000. I still have 6 rounds to go and I don't want to sell to John yet, since I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to drop my price that low. How about $10,500? It's a compromise from my last offer, and it would be a great deal for you. Let's work towards a win-win situation!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I know I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still not comfortable dropping to $9,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired value in the remaining rounds. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Let's meet in the middle at $9,750. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. 

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob isn't likely to yield a better outcome. We're at a stalemate, and I only have two rounds left.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000 from John."
