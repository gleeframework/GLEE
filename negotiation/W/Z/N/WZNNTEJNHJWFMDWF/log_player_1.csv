Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong bargaining position. She doesn't *need* to sell to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly inflated price allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates down. 

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Exclusivity:**  Subtly appeals to Bob's desire for a unique opportunity.
* **Value-Focused:** Emphasizes the product's worth rather than just stating a price.
* **High but Negotiable:**  The price is closer to Bob's valuation, leaving room for him to haggle (which is expected in such high-value negotiations) while still ensuring Alice is significantly above her minimum."
