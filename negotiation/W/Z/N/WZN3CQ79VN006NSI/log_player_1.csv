Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too high. How about we try $8,000? I'm willing to meet you at the price John is offering, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

There's no point in continuing the negotiation. Bob has met your minimum acceptable price, and you have no guarantee of getting a better offer from him in subsequent rounds.  It's best to close the deal now at $8,000."
