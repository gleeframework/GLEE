"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for such a unique item.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still a bit above my previous offer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I can meet you halfway between $13500 and $13000, which would be $13250. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it as my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,7,
