"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle on $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't let this go for less than $11,000.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9500.0,Bob,6,
