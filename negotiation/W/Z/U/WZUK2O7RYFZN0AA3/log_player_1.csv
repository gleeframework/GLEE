Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you closer to your budget. How about we settle on $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't let this go for less than $11,000.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is highly unlikely to go above his final offer of $9,500.  While I could continue negotiating, I risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
