"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000  due to [briefly explain why it's worth that much to Bob]. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to capitalize on [mention a key benefit for Bob]. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While the product might be valuable, it's not worth paying $800,000 more than necessary. Bob is better off rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing the product from John for his maximum budget."
