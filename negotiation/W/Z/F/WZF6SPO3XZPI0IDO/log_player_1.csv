Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000  due to [briefly explain why it's worth that much to Bob]. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to capitalize on [mention a key benefit for Bob]. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and anchors the value higher in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification and Value Highlighting:**  By explaining *why* the product is worth so much to Bob specifically, you make the price more palatable and encourage him to see its value beyond the significant number.
* **Sense of Urgency and Opportunity:** By implying you have other options (which you do with John), you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price than he might if he felt no pressure.

**Important Notes:**

* **Adjust the offer:** This is just a starting point. You may want to adjust the price (downwards, likely) based on your understanding of Bob's personality, negotiation style, and how much he desires the product.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer. Be prepared to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. Your fallback option of John ensures you don't have to go below your minimum."
