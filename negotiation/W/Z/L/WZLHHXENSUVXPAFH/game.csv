"I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we try $1,050,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value you place on the product, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be fair for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and hopefully, we can finalize the transaction.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
