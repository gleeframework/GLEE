"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
