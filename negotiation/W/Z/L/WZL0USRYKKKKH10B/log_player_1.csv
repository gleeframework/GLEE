"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me, and still a good price for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point, recognizing that the product is worth more to me, but hoping to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation. The price is significantly below my minimum threshold of $15,000, but still high enough to be a tempting proposition for Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also looking to save as much as I can. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I've counter-offered with a price of $10,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  I've also included a message that emphasizes fairness and the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm not yet ready to accept an offer that low, especially with more rounds of negotiation available.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I've counter-offered with a price of $10,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer of $10,500.  I've also included a message that emphasizes this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob and encouraging him to accept.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, but I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I am still not willing to accept an offer that is significantly below what I know the product is worth.  I believe I can still push for a higher price, and I want to see if Bob is willing to come up further. I'll reject his offer and try to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time for this negotiation. This is my final offer - $9,900. It's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price given the product's value. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9900} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, but I still want to try and maximize my profit. I've lowered my price to $9,900, which is only $150 away from Bob's last offer. I've also added a sense of urgency to my message, hoping to convince Bob to accept before I move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're running out of time, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold, and I'm nearing the end of my negotiation rounds. It's clear that we won't be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. Rather than risk losing out entirely, I'll take John's offer of $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay."
