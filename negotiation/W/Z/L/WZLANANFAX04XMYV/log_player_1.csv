Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. It's worth $8,000 to you, and I believe the additional value you'll gain from it justifies the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if it's a perceived value by Bob, can make the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $10,000, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price.  

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. I'm aiming for the best possible outcome, knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John for $8,000."
