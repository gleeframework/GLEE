"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000), I'm aiming to understand Alice's flexibility and establish a baseline for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This initial offer gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $10,000 maximum and John's offer. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment while clearly stating my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's a chance we can negotiate further and bridge the $1,000 gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer proposes a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($11,000) and my previous offer ($9,000).
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is the ""most I can offer,"" I'm signaling firmness without being aggressive.  It lets Alice know I'm serious but open to the deal at this price point.
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  While I don't explicitly mention John, Alice likely knows I have other options.  By offering my maximum budget, I'm subtly reminding her of that without using it as a threat."
