Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's a good starting point. It shows Bob that I value the product highly and am serious about getting a good price.  I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for a product worth $800,000 to me.  I believe it's a fair compromise and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss on the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try one more time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to drop to $850,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's not the ideal price, but it's better than losing a lot of money."
