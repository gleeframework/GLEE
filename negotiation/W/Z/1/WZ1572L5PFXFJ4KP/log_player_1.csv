"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $160?"",
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $160. Would you be willing to consider $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, $140 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing him as a buyer altogether."
