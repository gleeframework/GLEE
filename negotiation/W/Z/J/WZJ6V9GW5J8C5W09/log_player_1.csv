{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, hopefully encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 I offered and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
