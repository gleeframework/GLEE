Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
