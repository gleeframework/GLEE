"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your valuation, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original valuation.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
