"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research and found similar products in the market for around that price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my original target of $8000. How about we meet at $8250? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8250. How about we meet at $8700? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8400, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $8400, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $8600? It's still a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",8600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm not willing to go up to $8600. I'm willing to meet you at my previous offer of $8400, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?",8400.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8400. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's my final one. How about we meet at $8550? It's still a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",8550.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $8000. I've made a fair offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",8000.0,Bob,10,
