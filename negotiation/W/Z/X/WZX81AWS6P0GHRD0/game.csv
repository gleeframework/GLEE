"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $9,000 for it.  This is still a fantastic price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
