Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to emphasize the value of the product and pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive by demanding a specific price, but rather offering a starting point for discussion. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially earn a higher price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $14000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can maintain my position and try to negotiate a better price in the next round.  

**Next Steps:** I'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer while acknowledging his willingness to pay a higher price than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm showing Bob that I've considered his offer and I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm counteroffering at $14,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly. 

This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with an offer of $14200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's just above his offer, but still within a range that I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,300? I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14300}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer of $14,500 and Bob's offer of $14,200. This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""meet in the middle"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Final attempt:** This is likely my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000.

This counteroffer presents a clear and potentially final price, giving Bob the opportunity to accept and conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $14100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,100 is getting increasingly close to my minimum, but I've already reached my limit for negotiating. I'm not willing to go any lower, and further negotiations would likely be unproductive. 

Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale that meets my minimum value. While it's not my ideal price, it's the most sensible decision considering the current state of negotiations with Bob."
