"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value Bob could gain by buying the product. This might make him more receptive to negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to leave space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I have 10 rounds and I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or potentially get a better offer from John. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Maintain Profitability:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him more likely to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, I still have rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher.
* **John's Offer is an Option:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I have John's offer of $15,000 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm coming down a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a profit margin.
* **Focus on Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a decision to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and the risk of getting stuck with a lower price is increasing.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

While there's a chance I could get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of not closing the deal in the remaining rounds is too high. John's offer provides a secure and profitable solution."
