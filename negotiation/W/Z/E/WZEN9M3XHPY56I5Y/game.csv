"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $120. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $120, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $140. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $140, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a fair price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,5,
