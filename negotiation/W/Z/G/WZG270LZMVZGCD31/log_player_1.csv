Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary and hopefully maximizes my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."

Bob's offer is getting too low. I've already dropped my price significantly and it's not clear he's willing to meet me in the middle.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
