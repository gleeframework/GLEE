Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

At this point, Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $1,250,000. While that's still a decent profit, it's not the best outcome for me.  I'm comfortable selling to John for $1,000,000, as it's still above my minimum threshold. It's better to ensure a sale than to risk a continued stalemate with Bob."
