"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",8800.0,Bob,4,
