"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to get the product for as close to my $1,200,000 maximum as possible.
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer Alice makes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider a figure closer to $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than my $1,200,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests I can get the price lower.
* **Leverage:** I'll use John's offer as leverage to encourage Alice to make a more competitive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I do have another offer for $1,200,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:** I'm increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping it significantly below her last offer.
* **Introducing John's Offer:**  I'm subtly introducing the fact that I have another offer, putting a bit of pressure on Alice. 
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price point that gives me some savings while potentially being acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant reduction. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** $1,450,000 is better than her previous offer but still significantly above my $1,200,000 limit.
* **Slow Concession:** Alice is moving slowly in her concessions, indicating she might have room to go lower. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I haven't fully utilized the leverage of John's offer yet. I'll emphasize that I have a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this purchase. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer for $1,200,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I'm also trying to be fiscally responsible.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that my budget is firm, using John's offer as leverage without being overly aggressive.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a slight increase over John's price, signaling to Alice that I'm willing to meet in the middle but only slightly. 
* **Final Attempt:** This is likely my last offer before resorting to John's offer. This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision."
