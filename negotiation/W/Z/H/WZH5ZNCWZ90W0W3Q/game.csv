"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down significantly,  to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $800,000 is a significant step down from its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still pretty far apart.  I'm serious about purchasing this, but it needs to be at a price that works for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work for both of us. While $900,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to consider $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about finding a compromise. To show you I'm ready to make a deal, I'll offer you $975,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
