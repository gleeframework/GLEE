"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but only if we can reach a figure closer to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal.  $780,000 is simply not enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's make this happen for $820,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to move forward with a deal that's beneficial to everyone.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands!

Explanation: 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 in the remaining rounds. It's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and secure the product from John at his guaranteed price."
