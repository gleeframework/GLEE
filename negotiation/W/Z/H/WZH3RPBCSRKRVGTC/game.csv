"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but $1,200,000 is not feasible. How about we bring the price down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $700,000 is not in my range, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's close this deal!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but only if we can reach a figure closer to $850,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit more manageable. Would you consider $780,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal.  $780,000 is simply not enough for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's make this happen for $820,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to move forward with a deal that's beneficial to everyone.  Let's close this deal and get the product in your hands!",820000.0,Alice,7,
