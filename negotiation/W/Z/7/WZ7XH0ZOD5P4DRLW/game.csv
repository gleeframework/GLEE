"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This represents a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will far exceed your expectations.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
