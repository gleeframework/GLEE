Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway with $775,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut the negotiations with Alice.  She's unlikely to go below $825,000, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  It's not worth risking those extra dollars when you have a solid backup plan."
