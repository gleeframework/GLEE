Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to secure a good price, but I'm also willing to consider Bob's counteroffer if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is very close to my minimum price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much higher.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the deal."
