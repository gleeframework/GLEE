Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Statement:** I'm not just throwing out a price, but highlighting the product's potential value to Bob. This might make him consider the offer more seriously.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to express his thoughts, indicating I'm open to negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy is just a starting point. How the negotiation progresses will depend on Bob's response and your understanding of his needs and priorities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I know I can get $800,000 from John. 
* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my value, but I believe there's still room to negotiate higher. I'm not desperate for a sale, so I can afford to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit low for the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Hold Firm:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not caving entirely.  The $50,000 drop is a significant compromise, but still closer to my initial value.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential worth to him, hoping to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Open Door for Negotiation:**  I'm stating my willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us, suggesting that this is not a final number and further negotiation is possible.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. How about $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Value:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my initial counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant amount, but it's getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:** If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Bob walking away completely. The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely he is to find another option or lose interest.
* **John as a Backup:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a slightly higher price, I know I can still secure a decent profit by selling to John for $800,000. This provides a safety net and makes accepting Bob's offer a reasonable decision.

**Next Steps:** I'll finalize the sale with Bob and secure the $925,000."
