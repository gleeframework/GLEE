Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's sure to bring you significant returns.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves $100,000 of potential upside for me, while still being a great deal for Bob.
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a fantastic opportunity and highlighting the product's potential. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me and your asking price, I'd be willing to pay $1250000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better deal.** Since Bob is clearly interested, I believe I can push him to a price closer to my desired range.
* **The $1,200,000 offer from John is a safety net.** It ensures I won't be stuck with a price that's too low, but I want to maximize my profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's more favorable to me. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my initial offer or somewhere in the middle ground between our current offers."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 doesn't quite work for me.  This product is truly special, and while I want to make this happen, I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,350,000.  This still represents a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not going below my minimum acceptable range.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the product's value and emphasizing the deal's potential benefits for Bob.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is a compromise between our previous offers, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and potentially adjust my approach. 
*  If the negotiations stall or become unproductive, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
