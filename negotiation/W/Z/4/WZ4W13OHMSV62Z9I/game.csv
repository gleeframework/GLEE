"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial.  I'm willing to let it go for $1400000.  This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's sure to bring you significant returns.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me and your asking price, I'd be willing to pay $1250000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1250000 doesn't quite work for me.  This product is truly special, and while I want to make this happen, I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1350000.  This still represents a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
