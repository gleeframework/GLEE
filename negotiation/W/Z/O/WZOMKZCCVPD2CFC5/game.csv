"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $9,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that is within my price range and allows you to make a decent profit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
