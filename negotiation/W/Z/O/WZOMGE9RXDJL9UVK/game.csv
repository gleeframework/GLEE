"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value you've placed on the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
