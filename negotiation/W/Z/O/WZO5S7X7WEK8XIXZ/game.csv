"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service, which is usually worth $500. This will bring the total value to $11,300.
