Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to counteroffer.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's worth.

**Remember:** This is just the first step! You'll need to adapt based on Bob's response and consider your options (accepting his counteroffer, making a new offer, or selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10800. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired profit margin and leaves some room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially increase the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired price point. Be prepared to negotiate further if necessary. Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John if you don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $11,150. This price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to your ideal price point. It's a good deal for you considering:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit of $1,000 compared to selling to John.
* **It's a compromise:** You've already made a concession, and further negotiation might take too long.
* **Potential for future business:** Accepting Bob's offer could lead to future deals with him. 

While you could try for $11,150 again, the risk is that Bob will walk away and you'll be left with the lower offer from John.  It's wiser to secure a solid profit now."
