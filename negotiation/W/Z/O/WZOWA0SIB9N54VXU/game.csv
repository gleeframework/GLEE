"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I see in it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the value, the product's worth is closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to offer $1,800,000, but I'd also like to discuss the possibility of a warranty or support package being included in the sale. If we can discuss that, I'd be more willing to consider this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the price and I'm open to discussing a warranty or support package.  However, the product's value remains high. Let's settle at $1,912,500. This price allows for a strong warranty and acknowledges your interest. How does this sound?",1912500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
