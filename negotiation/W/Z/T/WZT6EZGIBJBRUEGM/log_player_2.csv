"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. It's a high-quality item designed to meet your needs efficiently. Considering its exceptional features and the satisfaction it has brought to our other customers, I am offering it to you for $100. This is a special introductory price, and I'm confident it will provide excellent value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You're not losing anything by rejecting, as you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the introduction price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to sell the product for $80?  This would make it a much more attractive purchase for me."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you while still ensuring fair pricing for my product. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a discounted price of $95? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get closer to your target price of $80.  You can always buy from John if the negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $85.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more than the initial asking price. In light of this, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $90. This price reflects a fair compromise between our interests and maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is within your budget and closer to your target price.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John for a higher price exists. Accepting the offer at $90 is a reasonable compromise."
