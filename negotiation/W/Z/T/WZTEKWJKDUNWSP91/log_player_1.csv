Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 makes sense.  Going too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob off, while going too low leaves potential profit on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a bit of psychological pressure and scarcity.
* **Value Emphasis:** Mentioning ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of why he's interested.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""fair deal"" aims to position the price reasonably.
* **Price Point:** $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount (saving $100,000) while netting you a $100,000 profit over your backup offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within the range that still benefits you. 
* **Don't Reveal Your Minimum:** Never let Bob know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000."
