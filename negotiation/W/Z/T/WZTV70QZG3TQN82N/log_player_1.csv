Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be quite valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to make him perceive it as worth closer to the asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost out. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay your minimum price. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of a profitable sale while keeping the door open for a deal with Bob."
