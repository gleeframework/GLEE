"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm aiming to frame the price in a way that emphasizes the product's benefits beyond Bob's initial assessment.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and accept John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product, considering its value and potential returns. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly above his perceived value. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of securing a price closer to $2,000,000. Selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I recognize your assessment of the product's value, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the full potential it holds for your business. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth and allows both of us to benefit."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, the reduction is calculated; I'm still aiming for a price well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's ""true worth"" and ""potential"" to steer Bob away from his initial valuation and towards the higher end of the price range. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have rounds to spare, I want to move towards a deal sooner rather than later. This offer keeps the momentum going and signals my willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating his genuine interest in the product. Accepting now capitalizes on his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also a risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. Accepting now guarantees a favorable outcome and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
