"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept.  We don't know Alice's minimum selling price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still higher than my counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, so I'll reject and see if we can come to a more agreeable number."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer to my target,  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1280000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,280,000, which is only $80,000 more than my last counteroffer.  It's worth accepting this offer. If I continue negotiating, there's a chance she'll reject my counteroffer again, and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
