"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Given the value I see in the product, I'd be happy to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 is my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,500?  Let's try and make this work.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $13,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $15,250.  This is my final offer.",15250.0,Alice,5,
