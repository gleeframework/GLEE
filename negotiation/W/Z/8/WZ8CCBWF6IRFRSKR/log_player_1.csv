"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open ended:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I still have 9 rounds to work with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. It's worth exploring that possibility before committing to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer, which can be a powerful persuasion tactic.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far apart from your offer. How about we try $1250000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still a significant discount from your current price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have several rounds left and can continue to push for a better price.  There's still hope to get closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, but I'm not willing to give up on Bob just yet. It's worth seeing if I can squeeze out a little more during the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. While I appreciate that, $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try $1,350,000. This is a realistic price point that reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm again offering a compromise, but this time it's a smaller step down from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Fairness and win-win:** I'm still using the ""fairness"" argument, but I'm also framing it as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again ending with a question to keep the dialogue open and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000. This is as high as I can go without going over my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $1,290,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the halfway point in negotiations, and I want to make sure I maximize my chances of getting a better price.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, indicating there might be room for a higher offer in the next round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I believe there's still a chance I can get closer to that price with Bob. 

I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal. While $1,290,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still a bit short. To make this work, I need to be at $1,320,000. This final price point reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Positioning:** I'm framing this as my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only asking for $30,000 more, which is a relatively small increase from his last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my gain. 
* **Fairness and Satisfaction:** I'm emphasizing the fairness and mutual satisfaction of the deal to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Confidence and Agreement:** By expressing confidence in the offer and hoping for an agreement, I'm trying to create a positive and collaborative atmosphere. 

This round is crucial. I'm close to my target price, and I need to see if Bob will budge or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000. This is as high as I can go without going over my budget. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Unlikely to budge:** Bob has repeatedly stated his budget constraints, making it unlikely that he will significantly increase his offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a profitable deal with Bob is high.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is a much safer and more certain outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John ensures I meet my minimum financial goal and avoids the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
