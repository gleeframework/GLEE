Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I believe this price is still fair considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
