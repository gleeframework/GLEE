{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit. It's important to be friendly and confident, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $65 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great price for a product worth so much.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I want to try to get closer to $90, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
