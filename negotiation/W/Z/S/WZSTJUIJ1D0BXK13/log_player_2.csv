"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for your maximum price of $1,200,000. There is no benefit to rejecting the offer and buying from John, as you'd pay the same amount.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you the hassle of dealing with John."
