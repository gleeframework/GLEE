"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering the product! I'm interested, but your price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer of $80, we're aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice. Expressing interest in the product encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a better price. You're willing to pay $100 to John, so there's room to go slightly higher than your previous offer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $95 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're continuing to negotiate towards a middle ground. By offering $85, we're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($80) and her current offer ($90).
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message reiterates that your budget is a constraint, but you are still actively trying to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and this offer is only $8 less than your maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make you lose the deal. Accepting at $92 ensures you get the product at a reasonable discount."
