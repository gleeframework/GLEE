"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. This price is below Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000) but high enough to potentially be attractive to her while still significantly saving Bob money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price. While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  There are still rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  He's still aiming to get a lower price than Alice's last offer, but also needs to make sure his offer is high enough to be attractive to her. This price is still below Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000), but also closer to the middle ground. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's offer, it's still not the best deal.  There are still rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, but staying below Alice's last offer.  He's getting closer to the middle ground, but still trying to save as much money as possible. This price is still below Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000) and hopefully enticing enough for her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher than Bob's target price. He has a few more rounds left to negotiate and can try to get a better deal.  Bob still hopes to get a better price than $1,450,000, and there's still potential to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer again, but staying below Alice's last offer. He is now getting closer to the middle ground, but still trying to save as much money as possible.  While he's starting to run out of rounds, this price is still below Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000) and hopefully enticing enough for her to negotiate further. He's willing to take a small risk and see if Alice will accept this offer.  If she doesn't, he can always fall back on John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's offer. This means there's no advantage in continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Since Bob only has one round left, it's better to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer. Buying from John guarantees Bob will have the product without further negotiation."
