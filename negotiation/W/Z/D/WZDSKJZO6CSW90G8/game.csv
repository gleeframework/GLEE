"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still confident we can find a deal. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. ",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm prepared to pay $9,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on to another seller.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10,500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
