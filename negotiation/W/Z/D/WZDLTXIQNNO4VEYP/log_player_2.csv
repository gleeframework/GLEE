Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.
