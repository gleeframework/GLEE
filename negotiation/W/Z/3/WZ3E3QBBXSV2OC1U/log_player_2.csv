"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept such a high price when he has a backup option with John.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation process and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer of $10,000. This is his maximum budget and sets a clear starting point for negotiation. Alice might reject this offer initially, but it establishes Bob's willingness to walk away and potentially pushes Alice towards a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a significant improvement over the initial $18,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $11,000. This demonstrates he's willing to negotiate, but still maintains a firm stance within his budget. The goal is to find a compromise point.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has more room to maneuver in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer has come down to $13,000, it's still beyond Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows him to keep negotiating and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with. With only 5 rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic and avoid making a hasty decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should increase his offer again, but only slightly to $11,500. He's slowly inching closer to Alice's price point, but still remaining within his budget.  With only four rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a balance between being firm and showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer allows him to gauge Alice's reaction and potentially get closer to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob. With only three rounds left, the chances of Alice coming down to Bob's desired price are slim. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $10,000, which is well within his budget and guarantees a purchase within the allotted rounds."
