"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a higher price than John's offer. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where both Bob and I are happy with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to hold out for a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price for Bob to consider.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better offer from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit more to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While it's higher than before, it's still a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better offer from him in the next round.  I'm also concerned about running out of time, so I need to find a way to close the deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $850,000.  This is getting closer to Bob's offer, and I'm willing to meet him halfway to try to close the deal. I'm still holding out for a better price, but I also don't want to risk losing him entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob and I are very close on price, but I'm running out of time.  I'm also getting nervous that I'll end up accepting a price that's significantly lower than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing. I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
