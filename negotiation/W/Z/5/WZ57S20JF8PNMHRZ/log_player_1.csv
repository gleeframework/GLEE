"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he's not, we can negotiate down from there. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal isn't profitable enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's a more realistic price point based on Bob's first counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping Bob is willing to go a little higher.  I'm feeling confident that I can get a deal done with him, but if this counteroffer is rejected, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm feeling confident that I can get a better deal with Bob, and I'm not ready to give up just yet.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a final offer for Bob.  If he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to meet my minimum, but I'm not willing to negotiate any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has consistently refused to meet my minimum, and with only three rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating.  I'm happy to accept John's offer, as it meets my minimum acceptable price."
