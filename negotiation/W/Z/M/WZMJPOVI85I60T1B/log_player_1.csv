Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation but also ensures I maximize my profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging. It highlights the value of the product to Bob and invites him to start the negotiation process.

This is my initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy to either push for a higher price or accept a lower one, while always keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept his current offer. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,500 is the lowest I can go.  This price still represents a great value for you, considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved slightly closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's closer to my desired range. This shows I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and explained my reasoning for not accepting it. I've also emphasized the value the product holds for him, hoping to incentivize a deal. 

I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and gives us both a chance to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13,500 is the lowest you can go, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm starting to feel like this is becoming a time-consuming process. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John. It's better to secure a certain profit than to risk further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a satisfactory outcome."
