Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I need to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still higher than my minimum value. However, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. It's a middle ground that might incentivize Bob to accept, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. At this point, it's becoming risky to keep negotiating.  If I reject again, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'd only be able to sell to John for $10,000. Accepting this offer secures a higher price than John would pay and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
