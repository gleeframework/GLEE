Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but I want to see how much Bob values the product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
