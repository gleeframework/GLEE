Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll be prepared to negotiate lower if needed, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I appreciate Bob's offer, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and  doesn't reflect the value of the product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for my minimum value right away. I'll send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. However, it still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value.  John is offering my minimum price, and I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation."
