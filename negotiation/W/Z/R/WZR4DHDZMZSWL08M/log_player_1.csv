Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We want to maximize profit, and selling to Bob for anything over $12,000 is impossible as his maximum valuation is $10,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** We know we have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 (to John). This gives us leverage. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering the product at $11,500, we're aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's valuation but potentially tempting enough for him to consider. It creates a sense of ""deal"" while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. However, this strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer somewhat appealing to Bob."
