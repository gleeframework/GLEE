{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:**  I'm starting high, as my minimum value is $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my target.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and enthusiastic, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to negotiate.  
* **No ""take it or leave it"" attitude:**  I'm open to negotiation by asking what Bob thinks, suggesting I'm willing to work with him.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  I will need to adjust based on Bob's response and my own assessment of how much he wants the product.  The goal is to find a price that is fair to both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum value.** While I'm happy to sell for $12,000, I'm not desperate.  
* **I want to see if I can get more.** There's a chance Bob is willing to go higher.  
* **I'm not ready to sell to John yet.** John is my safety net, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob. I'll need to weigh his interest in the product and how much room for negotiation there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand it's a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to make this work. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's $1,500 above his offer and $1,500 below my initial offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, hoping to emphasize the value of the product.
* **Negotiation language:** I'm using phrases like ""come down a bit"" and ""gives me some room"" to signal that I'm willing to compromise but have a limit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate my options and consider whether to lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $13000?  That's a fair price for us both, and it gets me closer to my goal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my target.**  While I'd love to get $13,500, $13,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of going back and forth with Bob and potentially losing him as a buyer. 
* **I want to avoid further negotiations.** I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, and I'm concerned about wasting time and potentially losing the sale altogether.
* **Selling to John is not a better option.** Even though John is guaranteed, this offer from Bob is slightly higher than what John is willing to pay.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with the sale to Bob at $13,000."
