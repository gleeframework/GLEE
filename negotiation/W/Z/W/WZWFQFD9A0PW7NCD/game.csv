"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay a premium for a quality product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,000 to you.
