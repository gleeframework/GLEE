"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what it costs me. Considering its significance to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the possibility of a better deal alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am proposing a price of $8,900 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this offer aligns better with your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though $8,900 is close to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate. Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the door open for a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still hoping we can find a common ground. I can go up to $8,800.  It would be great to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am prepared to offer the product at $8,850. This price is reflective of the product's value and the benefits it provides, while also being sensitive to your current budget. I hope this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a lower price.  Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's in my best interest to go ahead and do that."
