"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $15,500. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",15500.0,Bob,4,
