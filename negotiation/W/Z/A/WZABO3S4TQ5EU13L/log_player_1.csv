Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
