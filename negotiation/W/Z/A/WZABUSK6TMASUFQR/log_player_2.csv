"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to pay no more than $800,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My revised offer is $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than his maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and Bob has more rounds to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this time. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and reflects my commitment to reaching an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this product. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still closer to his target price of $800,000. Even though Alice has stated this is her final offer, there's still a chance she might budge if Bob continues to negotiate. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get a better price. If Alice rejects, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product. $920,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still slightly over budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise, and a good midpoint between our current positions. Let's close this deal, I'm confident this is a price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $910,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. If we can't agree on a price soon, I may need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still $115,000 higher than Bob's target price. With only three rounds left, the chances of Alice dropping her price significantly are low. 

Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's a better decision to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase the product from John. This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and saves him time and potential frustration with further negotiation."
