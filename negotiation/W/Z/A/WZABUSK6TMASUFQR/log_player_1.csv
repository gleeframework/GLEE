Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.
