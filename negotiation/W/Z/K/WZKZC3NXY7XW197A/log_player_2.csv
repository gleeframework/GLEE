"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's counteroffer of $16,000 is still above Bob's budget. Since John is selling the same product for $10,000, it's the smarter move to buy from John and save $6,000."
