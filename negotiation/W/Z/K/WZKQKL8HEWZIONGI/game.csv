"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I've got to make a profit, and $900000 is still a bit short of my target.
