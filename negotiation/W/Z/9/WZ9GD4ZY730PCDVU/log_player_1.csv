{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $9,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm trying to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the value of the product while also suggesting I'm flexible on the price. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing Profit:** $9,500 is a good compromise, potentially leading to a quick sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, I have space to negotiate without going below my minimum.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

I'll make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than his $9,000 offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:**  While $9,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of profit.

* **Minimizing Risk:**  By selling to John, I avoid the possibility of Bob continuing to refuse offers, potentially forcing me to accept a lower price.

**Rationale:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer secures the highest profit, maximizing my earnings.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Negotiating further with Bob could lead to a drawn-out process, costing me time and potentially impacting future sales.
