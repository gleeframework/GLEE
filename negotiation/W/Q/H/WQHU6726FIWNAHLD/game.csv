"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. My initial offer is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be open to negotiating a bit lower?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob, but I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would give us both a fair deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. I'll meet you at $11,750, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you have to make a profit, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a compromise. How about $11,250? This is a good middle ground and would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'll make one final compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $11,500, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
