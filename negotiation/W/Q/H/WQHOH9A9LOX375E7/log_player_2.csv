"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to bargain.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $110?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can get it for closer to my target of $105. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
