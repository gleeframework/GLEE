Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for some back-and-forth without me immediately having to accept a price I'm not happy with.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer seriously. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The existence of John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can use this opportunity to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices. 
* **The ""John"" factor:**  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not desperate yet, and I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $1,075,000 is a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, which keeps some negotiating leverage in my favor.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept my offer."
