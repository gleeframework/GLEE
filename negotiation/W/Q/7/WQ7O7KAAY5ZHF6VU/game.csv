"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a good price for both of us, and it'll ensure a smooth transaction.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $92.50. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That way, I can get a good deal, and you can still make a profit.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $100.  How about $95? That's a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away happy.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get close to your original offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",88.0,Bob,6,
