Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to maximize your profit by getting as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room in case Bob wants to negotiate slightly, while still ensuring you get a good price. 
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:**  By framing it as a ""special price,"" you create a sense of value and urgency for Bob."
