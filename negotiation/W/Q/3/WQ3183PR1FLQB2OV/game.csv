"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be willing to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it. Let's try to finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm able to pay at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,145,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1145000.0,Alice,7,
