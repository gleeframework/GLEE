"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Opening:** $175 is a decent starting point, as it's not completely unreasonable given the product's value to me and the possibility that Bob might value it higher than $100. 
* **Open Communication:** My message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I think $150 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is of the essence:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and forces me to deal with John, who will pay the same amount. 
* **No significant upside:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob, and the risk of losing him isn't worth pursuing a potentially slightly higher offer."
