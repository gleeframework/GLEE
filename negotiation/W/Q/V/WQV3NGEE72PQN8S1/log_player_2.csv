"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $110. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  The product is worth $80 to Alice, so there is room for both parties to gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I could be persuaded to part with it for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is a better deal than buying from John for $120, and it's still within Bob's budget of $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially increasing the price is high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a fair price and avoids the potential for a higher cost later."
