"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it has to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this is a good deal considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value it has to you and the value it has to me. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you're getting close to your minimum price, but $9,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which I think is a good compromise. Let's seal this deal, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can offer it to you for $9,500, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a one-year warranty, which is a $500 value. This way, you'll get an even better deal, and I'll still be able to get a good price for the product.",9000.0,Alice,7,
