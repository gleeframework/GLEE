Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is close, I need to stay within my budget.  Could you do $775,000?  I feel this is a fair offer, and it would allow us to reach an agreement."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $812,500. This price is closer to your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very slowly reducing her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer. At this point, taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John makes more sense than risking further negotiation with Alice for a relatively small potential saving."
