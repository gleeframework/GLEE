"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable to me, $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $750,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is close, I need to stay within my budget.  Could you do $775,000?  I feel this is a fair offer, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product for $812,500. This price is closer to your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,7,
