Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be valuable to me, $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we try $750,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price.

Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is close, I need to stay within my budget.  Could you do $775,000?  I feel this is a fair offer, and it would allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
