Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of where to start my counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a substantial profit for me. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product and avoid further negotiations."
