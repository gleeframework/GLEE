"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $105?  That's still a good price for you, considering its worth to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",100.0,Bob,4,
