Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 positions it as a significant saving for Bob compared to its potential market value, incentivizing him to buy. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really eager but wants to negotiate.  

By aiming high but reasonably, you increase your chances of securing the best possible price for your product."
