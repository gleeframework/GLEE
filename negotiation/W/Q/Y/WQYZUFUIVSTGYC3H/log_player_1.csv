Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net.  Alice doesn't *need* to go below this price.

**The offered price of $925,000 aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing the sale to Bob.**"
