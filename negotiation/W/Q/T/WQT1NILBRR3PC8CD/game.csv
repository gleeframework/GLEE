"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference at $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $15,500. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
