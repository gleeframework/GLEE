"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above your target of $150. You have room to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $115 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That feels fair to both of us, and it's a great deal for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target of $150. You have room to continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to your target. You can try a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price, but still leaves some room for Alice to come down a bit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $120.  That feels like a good compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
