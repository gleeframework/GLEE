{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but still lower than Bob's perceived value.  This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $115.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $115 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That feels fair to both of us, and it's a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $122.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $120.  That feels like a good compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $120, which is very close to my desired price point.  Accepting his offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for less."
