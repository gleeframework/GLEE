Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming higher than both your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without too much deliberation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, you might need to negotiate or be willing to walk away knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
