{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still seeking a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$9,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I will counteroffer Bob to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,800 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000. It also seems like Bob is serious about buying, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
