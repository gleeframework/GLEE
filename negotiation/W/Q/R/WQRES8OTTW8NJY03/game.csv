"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $22,000 is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do  $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is considerably below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my financial limitations.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us,  would you consider $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
