"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $1,600,000, which is $100,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
