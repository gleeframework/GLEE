"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the value Bob sees in the product will make him want to close the deal, even at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show good faith, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. I believe that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is willing to pay my minimum, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing any more time.  Selling to John guarantees me the $1,000,000, and I can move on to other opportunities."
