,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to invest $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would generate substantial returns for your business. Let's compromise at $1,700,000, which is still below my initial asking price but reflects the product's true value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
