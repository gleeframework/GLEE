"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it holds immense value for your business. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a high price ($2,000,000) sets the stage for potential negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the potential value for Bob's business could pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price leaves significant room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum threshold of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm a bit hesitant to invest $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a better price. Additionally, I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which guarantees a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it would generate substantial returns for your business. Let's compromise at $1,700,000, which is still below my initial asking price but reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm acknowledging it and providing a reason for my counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also stand by the product's value.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $1,700,000 is a compromise from my initial price but still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. However, I'm still hesitant to accept at this point. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** There are still 6 rounds remaining. By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to secure a price closer to my initial goal. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is attractive, I have time to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my minimum threshold while leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  My offer of $1,550,000 is a significant compromise,  just $50,000 above my minimum threshold. This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reinforcing the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain from the product.
* **Urgency:** By stating ""let's finalize this deal"", I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  There are only 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,500,000, which is my minimum target and a good outcome. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would like to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better result isn't worth it. Selling to John secures a good profit and eliminates the risk of not closing a deal."
