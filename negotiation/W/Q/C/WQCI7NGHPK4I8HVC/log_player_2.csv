"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $90 is cheaper than buying from John for $100. 
* Although the product is worth $80 to Alice, it's worth $100 to you, meaning you're still getting a good deal even at $90."
