"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's the absolute lowest I can go, as this product is truly worth much more.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $900,000? This is a significant reduction from your last offer, and a price I'm comfortable with.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. It's my final offer before I consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is a better number, but I'm still a bit off. If you were to come down to $925,000, I could close the deal today.  Let's get this done!",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to close this deal, and I am too! I'm willing to meet you at $937,500. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's finalize this agreement and move forward!",937500.0,Alice,7,
