"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some flexibility, but still staying well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we've only got a few rounds left. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm narrowing the gap, making a final counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this is attractive enough to convince him to close the deal, but I'm also ready to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and although Bob has moved closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied. Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and while it's not the ideal scenario, it ensures I reach my minimum."
