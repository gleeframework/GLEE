Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make a compromise, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $11,250 is a reasonable compromise and ensures we get the product without the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
