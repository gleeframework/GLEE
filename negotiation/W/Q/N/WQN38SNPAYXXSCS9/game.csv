"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility.  However, I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. I'm happy to consider a price of $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I have to say that $850,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
