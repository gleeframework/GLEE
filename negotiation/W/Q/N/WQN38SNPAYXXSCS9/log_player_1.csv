Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.

This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
