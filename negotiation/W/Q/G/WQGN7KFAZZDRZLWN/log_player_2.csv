{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. It's not a good deal for me. I'll try to negotiate with Alice in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to pay $80 elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $100, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $100 is still above my limit of $80. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried we're running out of rounds and I may not be able to get the price lower. It's better for me to secure the product from John for $80."
