"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.**  You're aiming to spend no more than $10,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to sell for $11,000, which means she has some wiggle room. 
* **You have multiple rounds.** It's better to try and get a lower price through counteroffers before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating your serious intention to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** It's not a rock-bottom price, giving Alice space to counter with a number closer to your target without feeling pressured to accept your initial offer.
* **Highlights your budget:** By explicitly stating your budget limitations, you establish a realistic starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You are aiming to spend no more than $10,000. 
* **You're very close to John's price.**  It's a risk, but there's a good chance you can get Alice down to your desired price in a few more rounds. 
* **You have more rounds left.** By continuing to negotiate, you have the potential to save an additional $500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, appreciate the compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating your position:**  By sticking with your previous offer, you show that you're serious about this price and willing to walk away.
* **Creating pressure:**  Alice has already rejected this price once, so now she has to weigh the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Setting a clear deadline:**  The ""consider other options"" line subtly reminds Alice that you have a backup, adding urgency to the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'll offer the product to you for $10,000, which is still a great deal considering its value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer matches your budget.** This is your maximum target price.
* **You're at risk of losing the deal.**  There's a good chance Alice might not go lower, and if she does, you might not have enough rounds left to get to your desired price.
* **You're not losing any money.** By accepting, you're getting the product at a price that doesn't hurt your budget.

While it might be tempting to try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high at this point. You've successfully negotiated a good price and it's best to secure the purchase."
