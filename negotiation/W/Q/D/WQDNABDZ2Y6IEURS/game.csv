"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I need to ensure I receive fair value for this exceptional product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable return. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
