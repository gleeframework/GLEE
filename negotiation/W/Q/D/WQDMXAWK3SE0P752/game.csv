"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I would like to propose an even lower price of $1050000. This aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a premium for it. I'm offering it to you for $1075000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm offering it to you for $1075000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best value you'll get for this product.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1075000. I'm offering it to you for that price, and I'm willing to throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. This is my last offer, and I expect a serious consideration from you.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
