"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20000 is unfortunately far more than I'm willing to spend. Given the value I place on this product, I'd be happy to pay $8000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my original offer of $8000. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between $16000 and $15000, which is $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
