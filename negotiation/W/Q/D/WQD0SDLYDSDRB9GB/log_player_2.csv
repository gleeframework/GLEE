"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $12,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate a better price or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This is the maximum price you're willing to pay, as you can get the product from John for the same price.  This gives Alice the chance to accept and makes it clear you're serious about a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, it's still above your maximum.  You can likely negotiate further with her, and if not, you're still guaranteed the product from John for your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's higher than your maximum, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but still have a firm limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price, and you're likely to save more money than you would by buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer and ending the negotiation."
