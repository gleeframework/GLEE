"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, but I'm also setting a clear minimum that I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm willing to sell for $15,000, Bob's offer is the bare minimum I'm willing to accept. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $17,500. This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for some flexibility on both sides.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** My counteroffer is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Reinforce positive rapport:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Leave room for further compromise:** My counteroffer allows for further negotiation if Bob isn't ready to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or make a lower counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the potential of losing Bob as a buyer or having to settle for John's $15,000 offer."
