**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price. While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming marginal. Accepting the $9,150 offer secures a good deal without risking the chance of Alice increasing the price again or running out of negotiation rounds."
