"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is high but not unreasonable. It gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob rejects my initial offer.  It also sets the tone that I'm serious about getting a good price, and not willing to accept a significantly lower value than the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. This is the highest amount I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1,500,000, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. The value of this product is exceptional, and I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair considering its potential for you.  Let's bridge the gap, I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's offer but slightly lower than my initial offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong stance on the product's value.  I'm hopeful this counteroffer will entice Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial stability. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can squeeze out a little more.  Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I'm not willing to give up on a potential higher price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,575,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

This is a more aggressive counteroffer, but I still believe it's within the realm of reason. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while showing that I'm not going to completely cave. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your effort. I would like to counter with a price of $1,560,000. This is my best offer, given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,560,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,560,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take this price, I want to see if we can close the gap even further. I believe we are very close to an agreement, and with only a few rounds left, I'm going to push for a price slightly closer to my target.  It's risky, but I think it's worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget limitations. Let's try to finalize this. I'm willing to accept $1,565,000 for the product. This is a final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1565000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It shows my willingness to meet him halfway while still maintaining a price that's slightly above my minimum. With limited rounds left, I need to make a decision soon.  Hopefully, this offer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've carefully considered it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,562,500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,562,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,562,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We've reached a point where the price is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and the potential for further negotiation is limited. With only two rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  It's a good deal that allows me to walk away with a profit, and I'm happy to finalize it."
