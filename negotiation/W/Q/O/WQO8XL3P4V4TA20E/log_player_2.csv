It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close to our limit:**  Alice is down to $595,000. While we could try for a slightly lower price, we're running the risk of her refusing and us having to settle for John's $800,000 offer.
* **Time pressure:**  This is round 9, leaving only one round left. Alice is unlikely to move much further in the last round. 
* **Significant savings:** Even at $595,000, we're saving $205,000 compared to John's offer. 

It's a good deal at this point â€“ better to secure the savings than risk overplaying our hand."
