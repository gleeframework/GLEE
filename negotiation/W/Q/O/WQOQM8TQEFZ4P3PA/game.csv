"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for it. This reflects the value it holds for me, while still leaving room for both of us to benefit from a successful deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a $150000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. $950000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to offer $900000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $925000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but I can't go any higher. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort we've both put into negotiating. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $880000, which reflects a significant adjustment on my end. I believe this offer represents a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal. If you're not able to accept this offer, I will need to seriously consider my other options.",880000.0,Bob,8,
