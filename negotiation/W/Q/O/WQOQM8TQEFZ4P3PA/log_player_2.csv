{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to buy for under $800,000, and her starting point is way above that. It's worth exploring negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects the value it holds for me, while still leaving room for both of us to benefit from a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. $950,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to offer $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
