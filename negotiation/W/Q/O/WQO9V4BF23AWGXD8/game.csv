"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and I believe you'll find it a good value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $750,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
