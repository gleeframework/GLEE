"Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming closer to my price range Alice.  I think we can make a deal here, How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your price range, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
