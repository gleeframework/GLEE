"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've valued it at $1,400,000, reflecting its exceptional value and potential. This price allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm quite interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $1,050,000?  I believe that's a fair price that considers its value and leaves us both with a reasonable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's closer to my valuation. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. What if we split the difference from our last offers and landed at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While your offer is closer, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product while also giving you a strong deal.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
