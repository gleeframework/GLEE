Bob should reject the offer.  He can do better.  He can potentially save $2,000 by negotiating with Alice."

Bob offers $9,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a better offer than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price. There's still potential for negotiation to reach a lower price."

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating but still maintains a reasonable price that is lower than Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer is too close to John's price, and there's a risk that further negotiation with Alice will either end in failure or only result in a very small saving.  It's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product entirely."
