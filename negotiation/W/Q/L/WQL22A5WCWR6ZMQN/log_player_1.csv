Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus he'd be willing to part with.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob before you have to sell to John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Aiming too high risks Bob rejecting the deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its value, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps things positive, emphasizes mutual benefit, and avoids being overly aggressive.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value, making it a good deal. It also nets you a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Notes**

* This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly higher prices to see if you can extract more value.
*  Bob's acceptance depends on factors not explicitly stated.  A more complex negotiation might involve understanding his needs better and adjusting accordingly."
