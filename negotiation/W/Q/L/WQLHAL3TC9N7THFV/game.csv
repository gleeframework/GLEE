"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $890,000, which is closer to my target price and a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more move. I'll offer the product to you for $915,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $915,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which represents a fair compromise.  This would be a good deal for both of us. I hope we can reach a final agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'll make one last attempt to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $910,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll meet me halfway.",910000.0,Alice,9,
