{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $110 is more than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $110 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to consider the offer without feeling pressured. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $100?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer is a smaller adjustment than the previous one. It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I still want a price that is fair to me."
