"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. Let's make it happen! My initial offer is $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I propose an offer of $105. This is my best offer based on the value I believe the product holds for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $105 is within my acceptable range and is a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a price that is both fair and within my budget.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the product altogether."
