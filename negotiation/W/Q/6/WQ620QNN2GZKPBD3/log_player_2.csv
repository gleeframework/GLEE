"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $180 for a product you value at $150. You'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

You're offering a lower price of $135, which is still above your maximum value of $150 but leaves room for Alice to negotiate.  This shows good faith and hopefully encourages Alice to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to your value, you can still potentially get a better price. You'll continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

You're raising your offer slightly to $145, showing you're willing to compromise but still want to save some money. This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, making it more likely for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $155 is only $5 above your maximum value and is a good compromise.  It's worth accepting the deal to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
