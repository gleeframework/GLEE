"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $650000 for the product. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $550000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable meeting you in the middle just yet. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a price of $600000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth while being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $575000. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts?",575000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make another slight adjustment. I'm proposing a price of $585000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth while being more reasonable than my previous offer. What do you think?",585000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, Alice. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'd like to propose a price of $580000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it at this price. I'm getting close to my budget, so I'd like to see if we can meet at this point.",580000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm proposing a price of $590000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this point. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",590000.0,Alice,7,
