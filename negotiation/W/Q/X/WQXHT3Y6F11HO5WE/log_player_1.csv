Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Your Minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale of $15,000 from John.
* **The Gap:** This leaves a potential profit margin of $3,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency (it's a significant discount from your backup offer) while still leaving you with a $1,000 profit above John's offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a quick and profitable sale to Bob."
