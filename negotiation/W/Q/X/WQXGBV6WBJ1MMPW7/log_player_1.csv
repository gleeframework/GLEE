Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, but she also knows her own minimum is $800,000.  Starting high leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's bottom line. This aims to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Alternative Exists:** Alice has a backup plan with John. If Bob rejects the initial offer, she can still secure her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited information about Bob's financial capacity or how badly he needs the product. More market knowledge could lead to a more aggressive starting price.
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, a softer opening offer might be more appropriate. 
* **Negotiation Style:** This offer sets the stage for a potentially tough negotiation. Alice should be prepared to counter-offer and potentially walk away if Bob doesn't meet her desired price range."
