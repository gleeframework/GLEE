"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be worth even more in your hands.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
