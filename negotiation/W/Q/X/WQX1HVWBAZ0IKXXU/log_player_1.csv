Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I want to try and get closer to my target price.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable selling at Bob's price.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm going to try one more counter-offer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
