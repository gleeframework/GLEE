"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not even close to your ideal price. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $14,000?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm sticking to my initial counteroffer of $8,000 and hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  But $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm firm on $8,000.  It's my absolute maximum, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's work this out."", ""product_price"": 8000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer than before, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to budge on my maximum of $8,000.  I'm hoping Alice will realize that we're both close to a deal and meet me halfway."
