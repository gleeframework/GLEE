Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000,  knowing it's above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still acknowledging Bob's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $10,000, Bob's counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is only $500 less than John's offer. To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
