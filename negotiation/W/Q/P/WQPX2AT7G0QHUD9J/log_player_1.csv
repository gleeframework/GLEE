"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $150, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher starting point gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Keep the door open:** An open-ended question allows for a potential counteroffer, giving me information to make a better decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a big loss.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing $140, which is halfway between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I use the phrase ""meet in the middle"" to show I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Positive Framing:**  I state that this would give ""both of us"" a good deal to emphasize mutual benefit and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $150.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price and will continue to negotiate.  The option of selling to John for $150 remains a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm now closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but have a firm bottom line.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the ""value of the product"" to subtly remind Bob of the potential benefit of owning it. 
* **Direct Question:** I ask ""What do you say?"" to directly encourage Bob to respond and make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've gone through several rounds, and it seems unlikely that we will reach an agreement that's profitable for me.  Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my price."
