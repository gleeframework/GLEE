Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value, I'm still a bit off on what I can do. Would $7,500 be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Reason: Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
