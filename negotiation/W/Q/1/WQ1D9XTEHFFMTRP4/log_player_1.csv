Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a price significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing you have another buyer, there's a subtle implication that the offer is time-sensitive, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
