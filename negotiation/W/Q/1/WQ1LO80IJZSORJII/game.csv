"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth a little more.  How about we settle on $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value of the product, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
