"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
