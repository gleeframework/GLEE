"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $900,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer of $800,000.  While I might have been able to haggle Alice down a bit more, saving a potential $50,000 isn't worth the risk of her increasing her price or me running out of rounds."
