Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
