Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This would allow me to recover a significant portion of my investment and still make the deal worthwhile for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this revised offer.
