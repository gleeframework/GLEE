"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1200000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on it. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This would allow me to recover a significant portion of my investment and still make the deal worthwhile for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this revised offer.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1400000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
