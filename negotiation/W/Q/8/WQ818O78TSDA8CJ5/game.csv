"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to $8000 as my maximum. If you're unable to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
