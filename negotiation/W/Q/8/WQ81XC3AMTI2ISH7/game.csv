"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but my absolute floor for this product is $850,000. It's a steal at that price considering the value it offers.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $825,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward.",825000.0,Bob,4,
