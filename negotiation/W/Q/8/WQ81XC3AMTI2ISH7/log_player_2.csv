Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but my absolute floor for this product is $850,000. It's a steal at that price considering the value it offers.  What do you say?
