"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can we compromise on that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to drop my price slightly more to $1,000,000,  which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
