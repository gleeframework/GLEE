Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price. I'm still hoping to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from him.  Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'd prefer to get a bit more. I'll accept Bob's offer."
