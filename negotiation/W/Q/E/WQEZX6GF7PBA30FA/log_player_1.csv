This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
