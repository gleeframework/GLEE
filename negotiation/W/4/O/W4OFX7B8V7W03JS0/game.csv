"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me at this price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
