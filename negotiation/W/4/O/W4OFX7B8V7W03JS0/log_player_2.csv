"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $9,500. I believe this price accurately reflects its value and I'm confident you'll find it fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's lower than the $9,500 she initially offered and closer to Bob's counteroffer.
*  This price is also lower than John's $10,000 offer.
* It makes sense for Bob to accept this offer, as it saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
