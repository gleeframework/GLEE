"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows us both to reach a compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $12,800 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
