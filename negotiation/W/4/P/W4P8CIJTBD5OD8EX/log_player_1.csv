Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Staying above John's offer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so there's no point in going below that. 
* **Balancing profit and likelihood of sale:** While you could try for a higher price, aiming slightly below your guaranteed price increases the chance Bob will find it acceptable.  

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
