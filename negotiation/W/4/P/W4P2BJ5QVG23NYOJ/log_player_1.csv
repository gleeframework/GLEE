Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids accidentally undervaluing your product.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** A price of $1,000,000 allows for a potential profit for both you and Bob. He gains the product for $200,000 less than its worth to him, and you make $200,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize profit, so finding a price that works for both of you is ideal."
