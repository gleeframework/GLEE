"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and positive to build rapport. 
* **Open ended question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage engagement and see if we can find common ground. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I haven't mentioned John yet, so Bob doesn't feel pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Keeping options open:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the door open to counter-offer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to move forward."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering, but not too drastically:** I'm not rejecting Bob outright, but I'm also not accepting his low offer. This shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Compromise and logic:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, which is fair and shows I'm willing to work with him.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob that it's still a good deal for him, emphasizing the benefits of the product and the value he's getting.
* **Positive language:** I'm keeping a positive tone to maintain a good relationship and encourage continued dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $10,800 is still below my goal.
* **Negotiation still possible:**  We're only on round 4, and I have plenty of opportunities to see if we can bridge the gap.
* **Staying firm:**  By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will come closer to my desired range.

I'm still hopeful that with a few more rounds, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about we settle on $11,000?  It's closer to your offer, and it allows me to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows my willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** I frame the offer as a way for both of us to achieve our goals, making it less about individual demands and more about finding common ground. 
* **Closing the gap:** The offer is closer to Bob's preferred price, but still above my minimum acceptable price, making it a good position to potentially reach an agreement.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the conversation constructive and keep Bob motivated to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **We're approaching a breaking point:** We're already on round 6, and I'm getting closer to needing to consider selling to John. 
* **Show strength:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a sale and helps me potentially secure a better deal in the next round.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my goal.  However, I'll also start considering selling to John if Bob doesn't come up to a more acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to reach a deal. You're almost there.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  It's just a small jump from your last offer, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering the same price as my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible but also firm in my desired range.
* **Emphasizing the ""small jump"":**  I'm framing the difference between our offers as minimal, making it seem like a small concession on both sides.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm explicitly mentioning the potential for closing the deal, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Time is running out:**  We're on Round 7, and it's getting closer to the point where I may have to sell to John.

I'm hoping this final offer will convince Bob to agree and allow us to complete the transaction. However, if he rejects it, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to your price, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to try to get a bit closer. How about we meet at $10,950? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are on Round 8, and with only two rounds left, the chance of getting a better deal from Bob is dwindling.
* **Too close to my minimum:** $10,950 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While a small profit is better than none, it's not worth the risk of losing more time in the negotiation.
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:** John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is currently offering and meets my minimum requirement.

It's a tough decision, but selling to John offers a guaranteed outcome and ensures I don't lose out on a significant profit."
