Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you decide to come down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This will help gauge his interest level. If he flat out rejects it, you know he's very price-sensitive. If he counters, it opens up a negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
