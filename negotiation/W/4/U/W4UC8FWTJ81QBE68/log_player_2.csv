"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation.  By proposing $7,000, you're aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) while still leaving space to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $8,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. However, $8,250 is still closer to your top price than the potential compromise point. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and encourage her to move closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $8,250 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer moves closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's counteroffer.  It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I can do $7,800, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer.  At $7,800, you're getting a $2,200 discount from John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, and any further price reduction is unlikely to be substantial. This offer represents a good balance of savings and securing the product."
