Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still higher. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $800,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another buyer or wasting time."
