"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. I'm confident this price is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, I can likely get a better price.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I have time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I can still push for a better deal.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and I have more rounds to negotiate. I'll try to meet her halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be, but I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 925000}
