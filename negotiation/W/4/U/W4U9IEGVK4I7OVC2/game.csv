"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to work with you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $12,000. It's the highest I can go right now. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
