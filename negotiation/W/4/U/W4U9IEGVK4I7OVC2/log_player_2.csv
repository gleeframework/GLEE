The product is worth $15,000 to Alice, and Alice is asking for $20,000.  It is a good starting point to negotiate with Alice.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above my budget, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
