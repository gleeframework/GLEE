"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's a good chance I can negotiate a lower price, especially since I have the option to buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to my target while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'm willing to push a little closer to my walk-away price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offers and gets closer to a price I'm comfortable with. It also keeps me below my walk-away price of $15,000 from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.  This price is a good compromise and saves me money compared to buying from John."
