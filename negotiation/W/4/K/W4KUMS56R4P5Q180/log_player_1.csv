"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  It's a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
