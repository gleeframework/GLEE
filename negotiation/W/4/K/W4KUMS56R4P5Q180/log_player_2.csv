{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  It's a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
