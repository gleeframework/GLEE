Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $140 is higher than $120, so Bob has an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  $140 is still above your minimum of $150, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both you and Bob are happy with.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $120 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is your minimum acceptable price, you can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Bob has shown his willingness to pay, but he's not willing to meet your initial price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Set a counter-offer:** You can propose a price slightly lower than your original offer, potentially meeting him halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not immediately accepting his offer, you show that you're not desperate to sell. This can motivate him to offer a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit, and continuing the negotiation gives you a better chance of achieving that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:**  $130 is higher than $120, showing you're willing to meet him halfway but not giving in entirely. 
* **It's below your previous offer:**  $130 is lower than your initial $140, showing flexibility.
* **It leaves room for one more round:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price slightly in the final round before selling to John.

By offering a fair compromise, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while maintaining your leverage.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
