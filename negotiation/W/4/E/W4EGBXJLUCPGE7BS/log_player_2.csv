"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is an excellent value considering its worth to us is $150, and it's significantly more than what it would cost elsewhere. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of our product, making it a great investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly above your $100 limit. There's room for negotiation. You should reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. However, my budget for this item is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and appreciative:**  You acknowledge Alice's offer and value proposition, maintaining a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Direct about your budget:** By stating your budget upfront, you set a clear expectation and avoid lengthy back-and-forths. 
* **Ambitious but reasonable counteroffer:**  Starting with $80 gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying significantly below Alice's initial offer and within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our position in the market, we cannot agree to a price of $80. We are unable to match that offer. However, we're willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Compromise:** Alice met you halfway between your initial offer and her starting price. 
* **Within Budget:** $95 is within your $100 budget, achieving your goal of saving money.
* **Better Than John's Offer:** While John offers the product for $100, accepting Alice's offer saves you $5. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal and risk Alice retracting her offer. Accepting now secures a good deal."
