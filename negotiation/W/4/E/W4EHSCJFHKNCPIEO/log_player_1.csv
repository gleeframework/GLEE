Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a ways off. Would you consider $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.
