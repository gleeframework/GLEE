"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a ways off. Would you consider $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the value we both see in the product.  I hope you'll consider this final compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
