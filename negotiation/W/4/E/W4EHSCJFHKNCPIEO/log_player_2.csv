"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a ways off. Would you consider $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,175,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects the value we both see in the product.  I hope you'll consider this final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which saves you money and avoids further negotiation."
