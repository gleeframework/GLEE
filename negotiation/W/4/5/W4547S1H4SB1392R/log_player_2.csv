"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its high value and importance to you, I propose a special introductory offer. For a limited time only, you can acquire this exceptional product for $14,000. This price not only reflects its true worth but also ensures you secure it at an exclusive discount. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to enhance your experience with our product. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price that's closer to her $12,000 valuation."
