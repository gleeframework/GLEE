"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, it's still more than the product's worth to you ($100). Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further compromise, allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price.  Offering $87 shows that you're serious about making a deal while still leaving room for a small concession on Alice's part. This could potentially lead to a final price that is mutually acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is just $1 more than your counteroffer of $88. This is a very small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price, without risking further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations."
