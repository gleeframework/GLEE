"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a price higher than $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $150? It's a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's not the maximum I could potentially achieve.  There's always a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price, so I'm choosing to secure a decent deal now."
