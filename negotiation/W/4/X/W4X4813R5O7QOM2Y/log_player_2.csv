"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** It allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  It's a safety net if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer.** $85 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Consider Alice's value.** She's willing to sell for $80, so $85 is a fair starting point for a compromise.
* **Keep in mind your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $100, so $85 leaves some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. 
* **Rejecting gives you more leverage.** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a price closer to your target. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight increase from your previous offer.** This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but still want a good deal.
* **Staying within your budget.** $87 is still below your $100 limit and leaves room for a potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters.**  This counteroffer will see if Alice is closer to accepting a price closer to your target."
