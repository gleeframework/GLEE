"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, aiming to get as much of the potential profit as possible.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, and while selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise, while still leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial goal, and with 6 rounds remaining, I have room to negotiate further.  I'll reject this offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the product's value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me closer to the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  With only 4 rounds remaining, accepting this offer guarantees me a profit of $80,000, which is significantly better than selling to John.  There's a good chance that Bob won't budge further, and I'm willing to accept this deal to ensure I don't lose out on a potential profit."
