Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 (John's offer), so I'm leaving some profit on the table for myself.
* **Negotiation:**  A price of $1,400,000 is a strong offer.  It's close to Bob's maximum, giving him incentive to accept, but it also leaves a significant profit for me. 

This strategy balances maximizing my earnings with the potential for a successful deal with Bob."
