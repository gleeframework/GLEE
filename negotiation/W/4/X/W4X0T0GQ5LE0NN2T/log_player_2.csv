"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down, and you can always fall back to buying from John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my strong desire to buy the product but also my awareness that her initial price is too high. 

This counteroffer also leaves room for negotiation and avoids being immediately rejected. We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target.  It's a risk, but potentially worth it to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price lower than her offer. This counteroffer is also a bit closer to my maximum budget, giving me some room to potentially go higher if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,570,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is still slightly above my ideal price, it's very close to my maximum budget, and there's a good chance that further negotiation won't get me a significantly lower price.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
