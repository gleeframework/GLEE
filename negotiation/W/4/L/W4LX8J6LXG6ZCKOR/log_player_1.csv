Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $2,000,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) because I want to maximize my potential profit.  
* **Appealing to Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and interest.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a lot by trying to get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I would be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** If Bob counters with a lower price, I can negotiate based on his response and my own assessment of his potential interest.
* **Accept John's Offer:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll immediately accept John's offer to secure a sale for $1,500,000."
