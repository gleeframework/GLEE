"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
