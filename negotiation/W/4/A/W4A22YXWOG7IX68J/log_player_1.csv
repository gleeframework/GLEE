Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""given its value and potential"") to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies that if Bob waits too long, he might miss out.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $19,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to go down while staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
