"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. I want to see if I can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get the product for less than $120 from John, so this is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get the product for a price closer to my target of $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $65. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's a fair middle ground between Alice's current offer and my previous counteroffer.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that Alice might accept, especially as we are nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $3 away from my last counteroffer.  While I would prefer to get it for $65, it's likely Alice won't go any lower. $68 is a good price, well within my budget, and I'm happy to secure the product. It's also worth considering that with only 5 rounds remaining, I risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate."
