"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is $1,100,000.  While this is close to Bob's budget, he has room to negotiate for a better price.  He can likely get a better deal than $1,100,000 since the product is worth less to Alice than her offer.  There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, which is plenty of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. His counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This offer is a good starting point for further bargaining, as it shows Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $1,100,000 offer, but Bob still has room to negotiate further.  Alice is willing to go lower than $1,100,000, but is not yet at a price that's significantly below Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to try and get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $950,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,050,000.  By offering $975,000, Bob shows that he is willing to compromise, while still aiming for a price that is closer to his ideal target. This offer might encourage Alice to accept, as it represents a decent compromise and still gives her a profit margin."
