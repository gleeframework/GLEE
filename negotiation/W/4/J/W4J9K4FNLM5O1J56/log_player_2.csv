Explanation:

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still more beneficial to buy from John at this point. Here's why:

* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers the product for $800,000, your maximum budget. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower than $850,000.
* **Time Saved:**  You've already spent several rounds negotiating. Buying from John immediately ends the process and saves you time. 
* **Minimized Risk:**  Continuing with Alice carries the risk of the negotiation failing, potentially forcing you to settle for John's offer later at a point where you have fewer alternatives."
