* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation down towards Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, justifying the high price.
