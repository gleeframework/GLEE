Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth while leaving room for you to benefit as well."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that maximizes your profit while still being enticing to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher than Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Consider Your Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so any price above that is a win. By offering it to Bob for $11,500, you have a high chance of securing a deal that earns you $1,500 more than your backup plan."
