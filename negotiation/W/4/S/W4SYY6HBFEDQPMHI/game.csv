"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground.  My final offer is $14,000.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
