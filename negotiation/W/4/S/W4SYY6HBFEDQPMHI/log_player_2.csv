# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget.  He can still get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground.  My final offer is $14,000.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above his budget, and he has already made his final offer and been rejected.  John is offering the product for his budget, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
