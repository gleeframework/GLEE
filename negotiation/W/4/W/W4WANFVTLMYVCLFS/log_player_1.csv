{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for some bargaining. It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer of $80, and it's likely the best we can get from Bob at this point. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a better profit than selling to John."
