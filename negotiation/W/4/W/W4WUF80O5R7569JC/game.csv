"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still think the product's value to you is higher than $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's worth to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,
