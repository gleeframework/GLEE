{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true market value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,400,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** I've included a message that highlights the value proposition for Bob (below market value) and encourages him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm starting with a price that leaves room for negotiation but is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Encourage Bob to engage:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit of the offer for Bob, increasing the chance of him accepting or counter-offering.
* **Maintain leverage:** I've set a minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) and the option to sell to John as a backup, ensuring I don't settle for a price that is too low.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* **Adjust strategy based on Bob's response:** If Bob counteroffers with a price far below my minimum, I may choose to accept John's offer to ensure a sale at my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's also below my initial offer of $1,400,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Price:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a more acceptable price.
* **Leverage:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Monitor Bob's Response:**  I'll assess Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he remains unwilling to compromise, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. To make this work, I'd need to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering its value, and it gives us both a chance to make a deal. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still considerably higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I've included a message that:
    * Acknowledges Bob's counteroffer
    * Explains why his offer is too low
    * Presents my counteroffer as a fair compromise
    * Emphasizes the value of the product for Bob

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  I've lowered my price but not to a point that would be detrimental to my profit. I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, but the compromise shows flexibility.
* **Encourage further negotiation:** I've used a positive tone and highlighted the benefits of the counteroffer for both of us to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept an offer that is too low.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully assess Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. 
* **Adjust strategy accordingly:** If Bob still refuses to budge, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further, sell to John, or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $700,000.  If that works, let me know and we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has slightly increased his offer to $700,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  At this point, continued negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that is profitable for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, even after several rounds of negotiation. 
* **Limited Room for Compromise:**  Further lowering my price would significantly reduce my profit, and I'm not willing to make such a large concession.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This decision prioritizes:

* **Profit maximization:** Selling to John ensures the highest possible return on my product.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of either accepting a low price or failing to reach an agreement, potentially leading to a loss of time and opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will reach out to John and finalize the sale.
* **End negotiation with Bob:** I will politely inform Bob of my decision and end the negotiation."
