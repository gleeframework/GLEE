"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be open to discussing."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $10000 is your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $12,000, which is still above your budget of $10,000. While it's closer to your target, it's not worth risking further negotiation. You can purchase the same product from John for a lower price of $10,000, which is your maximum limit. It's more beneficial to go with John and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
