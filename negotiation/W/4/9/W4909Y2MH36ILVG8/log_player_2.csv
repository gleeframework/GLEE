"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, and Alice is currently offering a price that's only $500 better than that.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, and he knows Alice values the product at $10,000.  He's offering $10,500, which is $500 more than Alice's minimum, but still $500 less than the price he could get from John. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,000 better than what John would sell it for.  This is a good deal for Bob, as it saves him $1,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as Alice has shown she's willing to meet him halfway, and John will always be a fallback option."
