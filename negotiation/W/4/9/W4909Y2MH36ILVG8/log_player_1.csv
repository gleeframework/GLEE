I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good deal for me, and I believe it is reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
