"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate, especially when you have a clear price ceiling.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle. How about $13500?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $13,500 is within my budget.  It's a good deal for me and I can avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
