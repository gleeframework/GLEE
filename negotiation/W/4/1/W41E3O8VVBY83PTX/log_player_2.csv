"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a premium price of $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still too high, even though it's less than the $15,000 John is selling it for. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. It's also a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $12,500 is still a significant amount of money for Bob, who wants to save as much as possible.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, there's still room for further negotiation to try and get the price down even further. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob is offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reaching a Middle Ground:** $11,500 is a halfway point between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Bob highlights the potential for a ""fair price"" for both parties, making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000 even? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Alice is now offering $12,000, which is only $2,000 more than Bob's last offer, and a significant drop from the initial $14,000. This is a good compromise that keeps the deal within Bob's budget.
* **Time Constraints:**  There are only 5 rounds left. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and Bob could potentially lose a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  While Bob could technically get the product from John for $15,000, buying from Alice at $12,000 saves him $3,000. This is a considerable saving."
