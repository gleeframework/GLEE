"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation, so it's advantageous to reject and make a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and pushes Alice towards a lower price. We'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still lower than my maximum budget, but she's showing willingness to negotiate. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure an even better deal.  I'll try to make a counteroffer closer to her new price, but still significantly lower than my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a good bargaining position.  I'm hoping this move will lead to a quick agreement, especially since Alice has shown a desire to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer gives me another chance to see if I can secure a better deal. I'll try a counteroffer closer to her price, but still leaving room for both of us to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 420000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, this time to $420,000. This is a compromise, getting closer to Alice's latest offer, but still keeping some room for negotiation. It shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also demonstrates my willingness to push for the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now just $25,000 away from my last counteroffer.  This means we are getting very close to an agreement. It's likely that further rounds of negotiation will be incremental and time-consuming.  

Since my budget is $1,200,000,  buying the product from Alice for $475,000 represents a significant savings. Accepting this offer secures the product and allows me to move on."
