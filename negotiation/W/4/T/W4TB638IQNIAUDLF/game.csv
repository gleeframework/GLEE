"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for you, given its value to you is $800000. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1350000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1400000, which is my best and final offer. I'm really interested in making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
