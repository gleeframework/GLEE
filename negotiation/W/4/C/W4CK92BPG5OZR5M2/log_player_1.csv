Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $13,000. It's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not showing willingness to offer a price that is significantly closer to my minimum. It's unlikely he'll reach my desired price range. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $12,000 than to risk getting even lower offers from Bob."
