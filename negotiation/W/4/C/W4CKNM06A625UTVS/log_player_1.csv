Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the price you offered is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there.  $95 is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll be going with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's final offer of $95 is reasonably close to my minimum, and he's indicated he'll go with a competitor (John) otherwise. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale."
