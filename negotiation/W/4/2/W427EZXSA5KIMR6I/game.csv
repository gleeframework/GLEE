"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115, which is closer to my budget. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer at this price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we settle on $120? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,5,
