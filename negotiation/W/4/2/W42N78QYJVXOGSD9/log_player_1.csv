Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay over his perceived value.  
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. 
* **Walk-Away Point:** Remember, your bottom line is $1,500,000 from John. Don't let negotiations with Bob go below that point."
