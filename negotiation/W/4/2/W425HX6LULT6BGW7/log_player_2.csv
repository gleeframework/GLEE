"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.**  This is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,200,000) but still within your budget of $1,500,000.
* **You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.** This means you can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John.

**Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial decision.**"
