"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $975,000? I feel that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
