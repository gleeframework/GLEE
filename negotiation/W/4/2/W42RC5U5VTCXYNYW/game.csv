"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still provides you with significant value and allows me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's work towards an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  To make this work for me, I need to be closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident this price allows you to achieve a substantial gain while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I am too.  Would you consider $975,000? That would allow me to get to a price I'm comfortable with.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to making this deal happen. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",990000.0,Alice,7,
