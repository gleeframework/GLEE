"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
