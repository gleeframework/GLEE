Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm asking for $1,000,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Sale:** Alice already has a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000, her minimum acceptable price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's no incentive to offer a lower price to Bob. By starting at $1,000,000, Alice maximizes her potential profit. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's truly interested. Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice is in a strong position knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
