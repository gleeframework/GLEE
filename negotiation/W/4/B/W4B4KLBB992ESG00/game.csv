"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. To start, I'm proposing $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
