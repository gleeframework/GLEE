"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  There's a chance she might be willing to sell for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 12.5% discount.  This is a substantial reduction, but it's within a range that Alice might consider, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,500, which is a good price considering my maximum budget is $8,000.  Accepting the offer saves me $500 compared to buying from John. There's always a chance I could get a lower price, but it's not worth risking further negotiation when a good deal is already on the table."
