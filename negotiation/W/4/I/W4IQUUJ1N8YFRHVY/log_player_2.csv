"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know you're interested in this type of product and I think it could be a real asset for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and it's a fair price considering the value it provides. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is likely willing to go lower than her initial offer. By rejecting her first offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price."
