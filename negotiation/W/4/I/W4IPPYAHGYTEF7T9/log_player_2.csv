Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500.
