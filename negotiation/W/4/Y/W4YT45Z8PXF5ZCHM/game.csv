"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750000.  I'm confident this product has great value, but I need to ensure the price aligns with my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $800000. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.
