"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  It's too early to buy from John, as I haven't explored Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000.  I'm confident this product has great value, but I need to ensure the price aligns with my budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $825,000 is closer to my target price, but I can still try to negotiate further.  It's too early to buy from John as I haven't exhausted all options with Alice.  I'll try to meet her halfway again and see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $800,000. Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $815000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has made a significant concession, and we're now within a range that's acceptable to me. At this point,  it's likely that further negotiation will only be a small change, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher.  I'm also still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
