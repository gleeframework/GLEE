Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it, considering its quality and value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Get a higher starting point:**  Asking for $175 allows for potential negotiation down to a price that is still profitable for Alice.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will reveal how serious he is about buying the product.
* **Maintain flexibility:** Alice can always lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $150. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum Alice is willing to accept. Selling to Bob at this price ensures a successful transaction and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
