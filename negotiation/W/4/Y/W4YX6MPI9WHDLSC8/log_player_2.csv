"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $120. This price is still within Bob's budget and offers a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $150.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer at $110 secures the product at a reasonable price."
