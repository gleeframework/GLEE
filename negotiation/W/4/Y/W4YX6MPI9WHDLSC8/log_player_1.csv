Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for Bob, but still gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $110. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair offer and accept."
