"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which might make him more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** There's space for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Avoiding John:** This offer doesn't necessarily incentivize me to sell to John yet, as I have 10 rounds to try and close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Not Selling to John:**  John's offer is tempting, but I'm not yet ready to give up on a potentially more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint:** $95 is the midpoint between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($85), showing that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm again using positive language, emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still hopeful that a deal with Bob can be reached within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** $90 is only $10 below my minimum, and it's clear that further negotiations with Bob might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds remaining. There's a risk of not finding a suitable price with Bob if I continue rejecting offers.
* **Avoiding John:** While John's offer is tempting, $90 is a good deal considering the time we have left in the negotiation."
