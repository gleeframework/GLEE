"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1100000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm really stretching my budget at this point. I'm willing to go up to $975000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really pushing the limits of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000, as I've already compromised significantly.
