Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Even though I was hoping to get more from Bob, I've reached a point where it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. I've made multiple counteroffers, and he's still not willing to meet me in the middle. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John."
