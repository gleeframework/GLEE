"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just isn't going to work for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $130.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth the value you'll get from the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $130 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get a good deal here. I'm going to make one final offer. How about $125?  It's a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  If you're not willing to go higher than $110, I'll have to consider selling to someone else.",125.0,Alice,7,
