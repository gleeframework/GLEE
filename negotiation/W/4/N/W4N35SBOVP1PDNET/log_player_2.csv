"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After considering your interest and the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000. Even though it's higher than Alice's value, it's still a substantial saving for you."
