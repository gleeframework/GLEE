{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's hoping to get a better deal.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $9,000. There's definitely room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a product that's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better offer than the first round, he still has room to negotiate lower. He should try to get the price down to his target price of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,800 is still a little higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down to $8,700, which is very close to his target price of $8,500.  He can save $1,300 by buying from Alice versus buying from John.  There's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer in the next round, and he'll be stuck with John's price.  It's best to take the deal while he has the chance."
