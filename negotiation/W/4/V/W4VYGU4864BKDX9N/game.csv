"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a product that's worth $10,000 to you.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,800 is still a little higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8700.0,Alice,5,
