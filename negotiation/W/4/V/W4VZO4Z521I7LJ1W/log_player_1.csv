Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 180}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $120. Since this is lower than my minimum price of $150, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $120 but lower than my minimum price. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 160}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $120, and I rejected that offer, I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than $120 but lower than my minimum price of $150. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 160}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John for $150."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my third offer, and now he's made a new offer of $145. Since this is higher than his previous offer of $120, I'm getting closer to my minimum price of $150. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 150}
