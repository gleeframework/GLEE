,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $88. This is my final offer, as I can get the product for $80 elsewhere. ",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $95. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
