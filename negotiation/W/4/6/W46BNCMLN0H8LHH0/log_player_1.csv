Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a high starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a good price.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value of the product to create a positive impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation, which avoids giving Bob the impression that this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've made a successful sale!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum value of $8,000 and the potential to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Met:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum value for the product. 
* **No Further Negotiation Gain:** There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob. Negotiating further risks him walking away altogether.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid potential delays in further negotiations.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is also an option, it offers the same price, and accepting Bob's offer is more efficient."
