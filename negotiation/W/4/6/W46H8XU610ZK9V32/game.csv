"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",12250.0,Bob,4,
