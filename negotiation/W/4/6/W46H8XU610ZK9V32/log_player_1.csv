Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $11,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see where that leads."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,250 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by counteroffering again. It's important to remember that John is always an option, but this offer is pretty close to what I was hoping for."
