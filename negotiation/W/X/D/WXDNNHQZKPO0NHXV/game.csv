"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see you're serious about this purchase.  To be fair,  $2,100,000 was my opening position, and I'm willing to come down. However, $1,800,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. Could you consider $2,000,000? I believe that's a competitive price that reflects its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
