Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think it could really benefit you and it's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's appealing to him but still profitable for me.  $110 leaves room for negotiation and is a good starting point. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity to buy, I'm creating a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines."
