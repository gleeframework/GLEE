"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $12,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That's the absolute most I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $10,000 is still $2,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
