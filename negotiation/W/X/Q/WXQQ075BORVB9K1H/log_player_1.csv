Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  While $13,500 is better, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's find a compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $9,500 is getting close to my limit. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, we're getting too close to my absolute bottom line. It's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 mark I need.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
