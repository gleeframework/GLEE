"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, you can likely do better with further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $12,000.  This counteroffer is a good starting point, offering a price slightly above her valuation but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable compromise that might be tempting for Alice to accept, especially since you are demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're still in an advantageous position with ten rounds left. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation to reach a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased slightly from the previous round, but it's still above your target. This counteroffer is a compromise, moving slightly higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's. The goal is to steadily push towards a price you're comfortable with while maintaining a good chance of Alice accepting."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have five rounds left, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  There's a chance you might be able to secure a deal closer to your desired price range.  You could also end up buying from John, but there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has increased again, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. With only four rounds left, you need to start getting closer to your target price while still being reasonable. This offer is a compromise, offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's last offer while still being higher than your previous offer. This shows Alice that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, and with only three rounds remaining, the chances of reaching an acceptable price within your desired range are slim. You're getting closer to your limit, and there's a risk of ending up with a deal you're not comfortable with. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $15,000. This ensures you get the product while minimizing the risk of further negotiation that might result in an unfavorable outcome."
