# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly useful for you and I'm confident it's worth a significant amount.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $16,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth would be fairer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should reject and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
