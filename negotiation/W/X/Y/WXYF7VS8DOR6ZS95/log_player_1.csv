Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This sets a strong initial position.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Back-up Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer, giving me the flexibility to end negotiations with Bob if they don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I do like the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is just too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $12,250 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize that this price is still a good deal for Bob, making it more attractive to him. 
* **Strong but Fair:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my original asking price, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to keep the negotiations open."
