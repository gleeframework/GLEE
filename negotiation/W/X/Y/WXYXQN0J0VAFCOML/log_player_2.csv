Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $11,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above my budget, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I've tried to negotiate a better price, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go any lower.  It's more cost-effective to buy the product from John for $8,000 to stay within my budget."
