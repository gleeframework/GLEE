"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, but it's still better than selling to John.  I'll counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm asking for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need at least $8,750.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still a bit above your minimum price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8375. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm worried that if I reject Bob's offer, I might not get a better one. It's better to accept this offer than to risk selling to John for less."
