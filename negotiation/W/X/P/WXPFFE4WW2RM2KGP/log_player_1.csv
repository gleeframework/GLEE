Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get close to my minimum while still leaving some wiggle room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith, but I'm still holding firm to getting a price closer to my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob is still below my preferred price, $105 is closer to my minimum and it seems unlikely we'll get closer to a compromise.  It's better to take the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation, especially with John waiting in the wings for $120."
