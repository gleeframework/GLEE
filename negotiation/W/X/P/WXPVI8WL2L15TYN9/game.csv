"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $7,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. How about we settle this right now at $8,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
