"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, just as it is to me. My initial offer is $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? I think that's a fair deal.",1375000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,375,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,625,000?  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm trying to make this work for both of us. How about we settle at $1,450,000?  That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it represents a good compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still firm on my belief that this product is worth more than $1,450,000.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1,550,000. This would be a win for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
