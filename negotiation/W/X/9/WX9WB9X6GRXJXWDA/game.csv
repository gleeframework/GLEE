,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,625,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,640,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",1640000.0,Alice,5,
