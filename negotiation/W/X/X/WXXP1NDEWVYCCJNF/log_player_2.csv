"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you have a better alternative. John is offering the product for $12,000, which aligns perfectly with your budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this more cost-effective option."
