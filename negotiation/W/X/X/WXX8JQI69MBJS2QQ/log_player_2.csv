{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000 but below John's price of $1,500,000.** This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price.**  You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $100,000 less than Alice's initial offer.  
* This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still giving Alice a fair price that's above her minimum of $1,200,000.
* This offer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, as I still have 9 rounds to reach an agreement."

* I have 4 rounds remaining, and I'm hopeful that Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise.
