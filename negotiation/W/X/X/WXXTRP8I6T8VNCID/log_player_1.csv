Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that sits comfortably between my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a firm offer, the slightly higher price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. 

It's a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring I don't undervalue the product if he declines."
