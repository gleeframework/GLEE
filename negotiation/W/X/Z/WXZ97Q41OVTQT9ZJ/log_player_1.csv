"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Fair Offer:** While $100 is high, it's still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $120 to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to discussion, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have the upper hand in this situation. I've already shown that I'm willing to negotiate and that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $100, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement.
* **Still a Good Deal for Bob:** $92.50 is still significantly less than the product's value to Bob ($120).
* **Maximizing Profit:** By aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, I'm maximizing my potential profit while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $92.50 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $88 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and move closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a price closer to $90, increasing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $88 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer again shows my willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. It demonstrates flexibility without sacrificing too much. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $90 is still a good price for Bob, given the product's value to him ($120). 
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer moves us closer to a deal, and gives Bob a clear understanding that I'm serious about making a sale but also need a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we do this - I'll offer you $89, and that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $89 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Risk of Losing Sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away, and I'll be left with the option of selling to John for $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $89 isn't my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to maximize my profit in this scenario."
