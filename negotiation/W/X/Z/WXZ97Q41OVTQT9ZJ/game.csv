"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $92.50 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $88?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $88 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we do this - I'll offer you $89, and that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
