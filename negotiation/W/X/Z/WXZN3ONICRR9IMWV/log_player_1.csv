Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product to me. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 120}

This is a bit higher than the minimum value I have in mind, but I'm willing to compromise to see if Bob is interested in making a deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since $105 is lower than my initial offer of $120, I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm willing to consider it. After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price. Maybe I can get him to meet me in the middle or slightly above."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my initial price. Maybe I can get him to meet me in the middle or slightly above."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send another counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my initial price. Maybe I can get him to meet me in the middle or slightly above.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'll sell the product to John for $100, as it's a guaranteed sale and I'm not getting any closer to my desired price with Bob."
