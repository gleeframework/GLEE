"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price of $950,000.  This is a significant discount considering its potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $850,000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm open to negotiation.  However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than John's price and still leaves a decent profit margin for Alice.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money while securing the product."
