Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's quite valuable, so I'm starting the price at $120.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately rejects a price significantly higher than his perceived value, it might mean you need to adjust your strategy quickly.
* **Leaving Room for John:** By starting at $120, even if Bob negotiates you down, there's a chance to make more than the $80 John offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think the product is worth a good price, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than both your minimum ($80) and his own stated value ($80). This suggests he's trying to negotiate a very favorable deal for himself. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product. You'll use the next round to propose a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're moving down from your initial price to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $100 price is still comfortably above your $80 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be. If he's stuck on a very low price, you might need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $70 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, his offer of $70 is still below your minimum of $80. You're only $10 away from John's guaranteed offer, so it's worth one more try to see if Bob will meet your bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $80 for it to be worthwhile. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're holding firm at your absolute minimum price while acknowledging his efforts. 
* **Finality:**  By stating it's your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept.
* **John as Backup:**  You're still above John's offer, but you've given Bob a strong chance to buy the product at a price that works for both of you.  If he rejects this, you can confidently accept John's offer knowing you tried to get the best possible deal."
