{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is close to my maximum, but I'm running out of time and rounds.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that's not quite what I was hoping for, and I also don't want to get into a bidding war in the final round.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe option that allows me to get the product within my budget."
