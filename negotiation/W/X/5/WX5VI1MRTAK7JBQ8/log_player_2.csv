"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Be polite and show interest:**  Maintaining a positive tone can help negotiations.
* **Anchor a lower price:** Starting with a lower offer ($70) leaves room for negotiation and moves towards our target price range.
* **Test Alice's flexibility:** This offer gauges how willing Alice is to move from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, and $82 is a reasonable deal. It's close enough to her value that she's likely to accept, and it saves us a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal."
