"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Considering the true value this product brings, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,375,000. This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
