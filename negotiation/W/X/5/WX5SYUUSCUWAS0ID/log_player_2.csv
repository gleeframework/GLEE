It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're in the endgame:**  Alice has presented this as her absolute final offer.  It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Significant savings:** We've negotiated the price down significantly from $900,000 to $810,000. This is a substantial savings.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If we reject this and counter, we risk Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at the much higher price of $1,200,000. 

While we could try to squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting $810,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of overpaying with John."
