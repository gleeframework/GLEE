Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $200 less than my last offer, and considering that I'm still making a profit of $2,200, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the possibility of a further decrease in the price."
