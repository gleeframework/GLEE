Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit and I believe it's a fair compromise.
