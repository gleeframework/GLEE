"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm offering you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
