Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still represent a significant value for you while allowing me to achieve a more reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $1,500,000. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? This would better align with my budget constraints while still providing value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It also represents a good compromise and a potential win-win situation.  Therefore, I will accept his offer."
