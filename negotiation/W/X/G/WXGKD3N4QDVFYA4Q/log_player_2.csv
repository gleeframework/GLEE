"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The price is too close to your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $100 maximum.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys our interest while also expressing that the initial price is a barrier. This keeps the negotiation open.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $70, we're aiming for a price that's beneficial to us while still being potentially acceptable to Alice (as it's above her own valuation of $80)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $85 is closer to a reasonable price, it's not a rush to accept.  There's still a gap between her offer and John's price. 
* **Alice is Flexible:** Alice rejecting our lowball offer but countering shows she's willing to negotiate. We can likely get a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $78? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, signaling our willingness to compromise but still aiming for a lower price.
* **Justification:**  By stating ""$78 is a fair compromise,"" we're subtly anchoring the negotiation around that price point, making it more appealing to Alice. 
* **Timing:** We're getting closer to John's $100 backup option. This offer keeps the pressure on while leaving us some room for a final small concession if needed."
