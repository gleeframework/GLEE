"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is truly a game-changer and we believe it's worth every penny of its $10,000 value to you. Given its high quality and the benefits it offers, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and our commitment to providing top-tier solutions. Would you be open to discussing a price that allows us to cover our costs and ensure a sustainable business model while still offering you a great deal? We're open to negotiation and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting price is too high. You know you have a backup option with John at $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for negotiation.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell and might be willing to come down closer to a price you find acceptable."
