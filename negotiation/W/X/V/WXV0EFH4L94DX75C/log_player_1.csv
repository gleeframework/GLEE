Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you before listing it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning you think the product is perfect for him, you're adding a touch of personalization that might make him more amenable to the higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, it's best to try and secure the higher price from Bob first."
