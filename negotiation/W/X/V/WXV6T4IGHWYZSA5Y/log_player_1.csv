{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating and try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is still a significant profit ($475,000) over our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

Here's why accepting now is a good strategy:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller increases, with the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means having the money sooner, allowing for potential reinvestment or other uses.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a chance Bob could decide to walk away from the negotiation, leaving us with John's lower offer.

By accepting Bob's offer of $1,275,000, we secure a substantial profit and mitigate the risks associated with prolonged negotiation."
