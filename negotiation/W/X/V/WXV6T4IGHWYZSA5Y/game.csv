"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while also recognizing your potential gain.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a decent profit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 is a fair compromise. It reflects the true potential of this product while still providing you with a significant return on your investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise that respects the value of the product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the sweet spot, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think we can do better. How about we aim for $1,275,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not going any higher than that.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
