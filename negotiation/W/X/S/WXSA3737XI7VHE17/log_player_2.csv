"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a slightly discounted price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price from John.  You can do better by rejecting her offer."
