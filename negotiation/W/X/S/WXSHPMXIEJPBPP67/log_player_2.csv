"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's a great price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it would still allow you to make a profit on your investment.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price, or buying from John for his maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $875,000, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $925,000?  This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks getting stuck in a long back-and-forth without any guarantee of reaching a price Bob can afford. 

Buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially sensible option. It allows Bob to stay within his budget and secure the product without further negotiation."
