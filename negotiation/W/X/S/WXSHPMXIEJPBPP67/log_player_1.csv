{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and it's a great price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A lower offer might make Bob feel like you're not taking his value seriously.

By offering this price and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of reaching a deal that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price by counteroffering.  

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your minimum, perhaps $950,000.  This will show Bob that you are serious about getting a fair price for your product, but you are still willing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown willingness to move closer to your price, $875,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum of $1,000,000.  The potential profit for you is still far too low at this price point, and it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a more agreeable number.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to your desired range, but still shows flexibility.  Perhaps consider a counteroffer of $925,000. This will demonstrate your willingness to negotiate, but also that you are not willing to settle for a price that is too far below your minimum."
