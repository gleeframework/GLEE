"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,325,000 for the product.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
