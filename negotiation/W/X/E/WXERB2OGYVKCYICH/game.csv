"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,750. If we can agree on that, I'd be happy to move forward.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,100. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being flexible.  $9,100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. That's my absolute maximum, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Bob,6,
