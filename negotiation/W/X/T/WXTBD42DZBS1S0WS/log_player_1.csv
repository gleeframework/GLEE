Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant amount for me, above my minimum threshold of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I believe this offer is attractive enough for him to consider while still leaving me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $925,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer, but still leaving room for potential profit. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, but it's also closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $925,000.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price is too high. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's a good deal for me and likely the best I'm going to get."
