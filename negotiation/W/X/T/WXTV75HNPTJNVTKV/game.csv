"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in buying it for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $135. This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
