Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still making a profit and are willing to negotiate further if necessary.

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while still safeguarding your minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum, it's still below what you believe the product is worth. You're willing to negotiate further and try to reach a price closer to your desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I understand your price point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer of $140. How about we split the difference and go with $135? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really close to my limit,  so I can only go up to $132. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $2 away from your original offer of $135. You're comfortable accepting it as it's above your minimum price point and a reasonable compromise. Further negotiations might take longer and risk losing the deal altogether, potentially leading you to sell to John for $150."
