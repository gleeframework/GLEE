"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. This is a one-time opportunity, so I suggest you think about it carefully. If you decide not to take it, I'll have no problem selling it to another buyer for a higher price.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
