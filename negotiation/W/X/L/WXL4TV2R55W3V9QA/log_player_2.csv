"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. This is a one-time opportunity, so I suggest you think about it carefully. If you decide not to take it, I'll have no problem selling it to another buyer for a higher price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price."
