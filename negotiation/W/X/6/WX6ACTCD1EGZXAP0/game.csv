"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $13,500? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $14,500? This offer reflects the product's true value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $14,000, but that's really my limit.  Let's make this deal happen!",14000.0,Bob,6,
