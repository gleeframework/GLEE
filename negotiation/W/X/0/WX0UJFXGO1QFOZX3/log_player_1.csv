Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product at a special price of $135 just for you. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $120, so offering it below that price guarantees he'll accept, but that doesn't maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob counters. He might be willing to go a bit higher than $120.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out as I can sell to John for my minimum price of $150.

This strategy aims to get the best possible price from Bob while having a safety net with John's offer."
