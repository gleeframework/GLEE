"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $10000. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $12000. I hope you can see the value in this compromise and accept my offer.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on a price. Would you be willing to accept $9500 or is it a deal-breaker?",9500.0,Bob,6,
