"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $6,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $7,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $7,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,100?  That's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $7,100.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my target and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can find another buyer who will pay closer to my asking price in the future."
