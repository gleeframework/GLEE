"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
