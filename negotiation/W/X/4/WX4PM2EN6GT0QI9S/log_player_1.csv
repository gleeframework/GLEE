Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to $15,000 as possible without risking Bob walking away. By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I'm maximizing my chances of reaching a profitable agreement. If negotiations fail, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'll get my minimum asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer, aiming to meet him halfway or find a compromise that works for both of us. This approach allows me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob's current offer while also keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate the fairness of my counteroffer. 
* **Finding a Solution:** I'm using positive and collaborative language to encourage Bob to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a quicker agreement while still securing a higher price than Bob's initial offer. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, potentially lowering my price slightly. However, if negotiations continue to stall, I'll switch to selling the product to John."
