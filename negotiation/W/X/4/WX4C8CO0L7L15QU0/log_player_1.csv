Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,000,000 without going so high that Bob walks away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:**  While vague, mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly implies there are reasons for the price beyond just your desire to sell.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You've left some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds to this initial offer will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate slightly but stand firm on your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you significant leverage. Don't be afraid to walk away from the deal with Bob if he's not willing to meet a price that's beneficial to you."
