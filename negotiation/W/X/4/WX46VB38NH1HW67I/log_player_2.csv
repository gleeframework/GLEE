* **Last Round:** This is the final round of negotiations with Alice.  If Bob rejects this offer, he's left with only John's option. 
* **John's Offer:** While $8,000 is ideal, there's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell at that price after Bob has negotiated with Alice. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. While he doesn't get the absolute lowest price, he's still getting a good deal."
