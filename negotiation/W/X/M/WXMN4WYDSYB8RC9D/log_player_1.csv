"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further and eventually sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I still have 8 rounds left and believe I can potentially get a better price. 

I'll use this round to counter-offer and see if I can find a middle ground closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This would allow both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $9,750, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the fairness of my offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept. 

I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $9,500, but I'm also aware that selling to John is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $9,600. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,500.  Since we are now halfway through the negotiation rounds, I am confident that I won't get a significantly better price.  It's better to secure the deal with Bob than risk losing the opportunity to sell to John."
