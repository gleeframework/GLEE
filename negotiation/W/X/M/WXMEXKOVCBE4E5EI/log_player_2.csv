Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Even though Alice's offer is close to John's price, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get closer to $8,000."
