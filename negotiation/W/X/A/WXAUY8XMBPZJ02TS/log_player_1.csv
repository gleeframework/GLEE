"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation and leaves room for a compromise. If Bob is truly interested, he'll counter, and we can then work towards a price that benefits both of us. If he rejects the offer outright, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come closer to my desired price in the next round.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,600. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still lower than my previous counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can do better. I'm not quite ready to settle for $9,300.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible. This price is a compromise, but it still gets me above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While time is running out, I'm holding out for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9350}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $9,350. This is very close to Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price than my initial goal to ensure a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round and Bob's offer of $9,100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Therefore, I will accept John's offer of $8,000 to ensure a sale. While it's not my desired price, it's still above my minimum and guarantees me a deal."
