"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being more in line with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
