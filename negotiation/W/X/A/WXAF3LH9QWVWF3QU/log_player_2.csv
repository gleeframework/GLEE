# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below what I would receive from someone else. What do you think?
