Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price is still fair, considering the product's potential, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.

I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
