"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the potential you mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price is still fair, considering the product's potential, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Considering the potential you've highlighted, I'm willing to offer $1500000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping you'll agree.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
