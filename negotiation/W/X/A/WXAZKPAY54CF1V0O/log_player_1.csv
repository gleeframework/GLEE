"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I've also included a message that emphasizes the product's value and my belief in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the potential you mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds remaining and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or secure a deal with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price is still fair, considering the product's potential, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1700000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Considering the potential you've highlighted, I'm willing to offer $1500000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping you'll agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
