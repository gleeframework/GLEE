Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll aim for a price that's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's say I'll offer Bob a price of $1,800,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since I don't want to give away the product too cheaply, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll increase the price by $50,000 to $1,550,000, which is still a reasonable offer considering the product's value.
