Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup removes pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to engage in negotiation, making it more likely he'll counter-offer rather than just rejecting outright.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer if needed."
