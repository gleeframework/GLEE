Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profits, but I also want to be realistic and ensure that Bob doesn't walk away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is only $500 lower than my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
