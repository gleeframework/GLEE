"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,5,
