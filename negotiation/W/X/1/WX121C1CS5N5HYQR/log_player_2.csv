Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9,500.

Alice seems pretty firm on a price well above your limit and is unlikely to come down enough in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the $8,000 price from John now."
