"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,$12000
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
