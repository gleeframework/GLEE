"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $825,000, which is as low as I'm comfortable going. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
