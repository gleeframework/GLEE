"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further, especially since Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a substantial profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000,  Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering and puts me closer to my desired price point.  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to strike a deal that secures a strong profit without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
