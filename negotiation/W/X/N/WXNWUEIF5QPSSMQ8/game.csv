,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a substantial profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",950000.0,Bob,4,
