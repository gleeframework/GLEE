"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $120.**  This is less than your maximum price of $150. 
* **Buying from John costs $150.** This means you'd save $30 by accepting Alice's offer."
