"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely bring value to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than his maximum budget of $10,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the information about the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $10,000, which is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at 11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he should still try to negotiate a lower price. He can try to counter-offer again, aiming for something closer to his maximum budget of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm very interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 10500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at 10800? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,800 is close to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has a few more rounds to work with and can still buy the product from John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really keen on acquiring this product, but $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,200.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 10200 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 10500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has already rejected his offer of $10,200, and now she is offering $10,500.  At this point, Bob is only $500 away from his maximum budget, and he only has 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely Alice will lower her price further in that time.   Since John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, he should buy from John to avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
