**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, while John would sell it for $1,200,000. This means Bob saves $250,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is still above the product's value to him ($800,000), it's the most financially beneficial option."
