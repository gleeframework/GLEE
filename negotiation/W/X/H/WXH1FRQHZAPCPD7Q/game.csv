"Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to come in lower. How about $12500?  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $13750? This would still give me a reasonable profit while being more in line with your budget.  What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
