"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both room to make a profitable deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I see the value in your product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial stability. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
