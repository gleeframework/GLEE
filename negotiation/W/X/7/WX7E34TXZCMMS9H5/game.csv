"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This would still allow me to achieve a fair value for the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
