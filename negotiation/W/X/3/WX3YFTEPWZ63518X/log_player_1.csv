Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The goal is to maximize profit.**  Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, any offer above that amount is a potential gain.
* **Uncertainty about Bob's valuation:**  I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob. Therefore, a higher offer increases the chances of Bob accepting but also lowers the potential profit if he rejects.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  Offering $1,500,000 provides a significant margin over John's offer, potentially leading to a much higher profit. However, there's a higher chance Bob might reject the offer. 

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing potential profit and minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
