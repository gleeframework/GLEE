You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John at a lower price."
