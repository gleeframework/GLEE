"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price a bit above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be attractive to him. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $105 is better than his initial value of $100, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $110. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still a good price for me. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $112. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm offering $112 to Bob in this round. It's a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still keeping the price above my minimum.  I hope this compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $109 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I am still going to reject Bob's offer. I have 4 more rounds to try and get a better price, and I think I can still get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not able to accept $109.  Let's try $111.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair middle ground."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

I'm offering $111 to Bob. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a price above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to make a deal. Can you meet me at $110? That's the absolute best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $110.  While it's still below my ideal price of $120, it's only one round away from my minimum acceptable price. I have two more rounds left, but I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob.  Also, if I reject Bob's offer and sell to John, I'll only get $120, so it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
