"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a higher price than the minimum I'd accept.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's not unreasonable. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can get closer to $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping Bob will budge a little more.  I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but not too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $15,500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and we're running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
