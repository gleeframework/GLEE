{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Its value to both of us is undeniable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor value ($1,000,000). It makes sense to aim high initially.
* **Potential Value:** Knowing Bob also values it at $1,000,000 suggests there's room for a higher sale price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having a guaranteed buyer (John) eliminates the risk of completely losing the sale.

**Strategy:**

This offer starts with a strong opening bid, aiming to maximize profit. If Bob rejects it, there's still the safety net of selling to John at the base value."
