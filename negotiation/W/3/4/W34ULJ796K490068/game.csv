"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm going to counter with a price of $13500. I think this is a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the point where I might need to consider selling the product to John. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to counter with a price of $12800. I think this is as low as I can go and still get a fair return on my investment.,12800.0,Alice,7,
