Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $99 is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a good deal compared to him not getting the product.
* **Simple Message:** Keeping the message short and to the point avoids unnecessary complexity."
