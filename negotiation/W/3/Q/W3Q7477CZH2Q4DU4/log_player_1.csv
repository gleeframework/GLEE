Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit.  Ideally, you want to capture some of that $200,000 potential profit Bob has.

**The Offer**

You need to strike a balance: a price too high might scare Bob off, while a price too low leaves money on the table. 

Here's my suggestion:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Strong opening:**  You acknowledge the product's value to Bob, setting a collaborative tone.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While starting at $1,150,000, you signal flexibility with ""mutually beneficial.""
* **Favorable split:** This price gives Bob a $50,000 gain while netting you $150,000 above your fallback option.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you may need to adjust your price during the negotiation."
