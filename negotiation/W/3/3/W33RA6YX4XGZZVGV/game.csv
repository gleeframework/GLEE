"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for it. I hope this revised price aligns better with our interests.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This price still gives you a significant value proposition, and allows us to close this deal fairly.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to meet you at $1,600,000. I would like to propose $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,450,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This would be a good compromise, giving you a good deal and allowing me to meet my minimum.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
