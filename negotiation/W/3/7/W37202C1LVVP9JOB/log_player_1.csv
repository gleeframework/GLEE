Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $150, which reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By stating you believe the product is highly beneficial to Bob and that the price reflects its ""true value,"" you are anchoring the value in his mind at a higher point.
* **Alternative:** You have a fallback buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always decrease your asking price, but you can't increase it once an offer is made."
