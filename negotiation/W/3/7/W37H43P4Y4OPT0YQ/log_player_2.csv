"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the high quality and potential of the product, while still giving you a significant return on your investment. Please let me know your decision, as I have another interested party who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
