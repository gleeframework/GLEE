{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and emphasizing the value of the product. This helps build a positive impression and encourages Bob to consider accepting.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:**  $9,500 is significantly closer to my minimum value of $10,000 than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll have room to adjust the price without sacrificing too much.
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or if I feel I can't get closer to my desired price, I can always choose to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing losses:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing $3,000 compared to my minimum desired price.
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Exploring other options:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep open the possibility of selling to John for $10,000, which would be the most profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $8,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum desired price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my position. I'm also highlighting the potential ""great deal"" for him, hoping to encourage him to reconsider.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $8,500 is a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal.
* **Preserve bargaining power:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Maintain the John option:**  I'm still keeping the possibility of selling to John open, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept any offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,750 is closer to my minimum desired price of $10,000 than his previous offer, it still falls short of my ideal outcome.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make another counteroffer, perhaps closer to the midpoint between my last offer and his, to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining bargaining power:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Option to sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which is still a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's try $8,250. It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $8,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's current offer of $7,750. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and expressing a desire to reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer shows a clear intention to find common ground and hopefully leads to a successful deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** It allows me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob's current offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open, which allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob."
