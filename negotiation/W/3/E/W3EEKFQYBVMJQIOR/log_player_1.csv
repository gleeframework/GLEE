Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has repeatedly offered $12,000, which is my minimum, but I don't have time to continue negotiating. It's clear that he's unlikely to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John."
