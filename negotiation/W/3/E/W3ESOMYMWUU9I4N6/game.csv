"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,100,000? This is still a fantastic price for you, considering your estimated value, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I was thinking we could meet at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, but $1,025,000 still falls a bit short of what I need.  How about we split the difference again and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us one step closer to closing this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $975,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,8,
