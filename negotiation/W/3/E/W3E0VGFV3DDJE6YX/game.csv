,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $130. How about we try $132? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to pay $132. How about we meet at $129? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",129.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $129. I'm willing to meet you at $131, which is still a good compromise for me. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",131.0,Alice,7,
