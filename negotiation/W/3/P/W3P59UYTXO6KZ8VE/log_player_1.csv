"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given the value you place on it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows confidence in my product and sets a high bar for the negotiation.  I'm open to counteroffers, but I'll also consider selling to John if the negotiation drags on or Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought, and I'd like to propose $1,025,000 as the price for your product. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While it's less than my initial asking price, it's above my minimum and I'm nearing the midpoint of the negotiation. Selling to John at $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'd rather close the deal with Bob. It's worth the risk of losing a little bit more money to get this done with him."
