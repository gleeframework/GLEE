"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However,  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer you $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,250 is still a little higher than what I'm able to pay at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $9,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
