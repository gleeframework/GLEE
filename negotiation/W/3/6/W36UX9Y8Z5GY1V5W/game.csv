"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'll derive from it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and potential. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product. This offer is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it holds for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
