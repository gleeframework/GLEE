"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $120. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
