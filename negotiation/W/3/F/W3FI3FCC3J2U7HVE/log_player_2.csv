"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This exceptional item holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you might be even greater. After careful consideration, I am extending to you the chance to purchase this product at a special offer price of $950,000. This amount reflects a strategic balance between ensuring a fair return on my investment and providing you with a significant saving compared to its market value of $1,200,000. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you require any additional information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  $950,000 is significantly less than $1,200,000. 
* **You can still make a profit.**  You value the product at $1,200,000 and are buying it for $950,000, meaning you're getting it for less than your perceived value."
