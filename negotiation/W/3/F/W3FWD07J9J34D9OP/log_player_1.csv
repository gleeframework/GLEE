Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get a better price while still being within the range of Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than $105.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given it some thought and I'm willing to go up to $103 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $103 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I want to see if I can push for a better deal before considering selling to John.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $103 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $104.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome."", ""product_price"": 104}
