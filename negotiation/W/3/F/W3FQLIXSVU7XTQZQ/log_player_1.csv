Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that figure is sensible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's maximum valuation leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate, so you can confidently price higher with Bob."
