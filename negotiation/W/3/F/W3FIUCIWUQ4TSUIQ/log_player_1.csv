Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10500. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $10,500 is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10750. This is the highest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and closer to my target than selling to John. It's better to secure a sale now and avoid risking further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
