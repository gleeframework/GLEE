Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close, and I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To be honest, anything much above $780,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  Would you be willing to come down just a bit more?"", ""product_price"": 780000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and while it's slightly above your ideal price, it's a better deal than buying from John at $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate has a high risk of Alice walking away."
