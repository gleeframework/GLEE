{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $77.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $77.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not quite enough. I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  It's a lower price than I hoped for, but it guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
