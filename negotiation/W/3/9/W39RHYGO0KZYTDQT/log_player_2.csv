Alice is increasing her price. While $92 is still better than $100 from John, you can likely still get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is getting closer to John's price and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price from her. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $100 to avoid further negotiation."
