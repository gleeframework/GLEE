# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** $9,500 is less than the $12,000 Bob would pay John. 
* **Bob saves money:**  Even though Bob values the product at $12,000, he can get it for $9,500, saving $2,500."
