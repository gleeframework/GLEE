"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering I could always buy it from John for $8,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have options, but this product is worth significantly more than that to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm sticking to $8,500. It's a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a better deal.  Would you consider $7,500? That's a significant price for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal. While I'm always open to negotiating, I'm firm on $8,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value. If we can't agree on this, I'm prepared to move on to another buyer. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
