Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, there's no incentive to go lower.  
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at your desired price sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to get closer to your desired outcome than if you started lower. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy maximizes potential profit, it's possible Bob will reject the offer outright. Weigh the risk of losing the sale to Bob against the guaranteed sale to John."
