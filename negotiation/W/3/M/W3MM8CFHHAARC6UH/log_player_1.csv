{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable point, we're still significantly above his perceived value and below our minimum.  We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but also hold firm to a price point that reflects the product's true worth. Selling to John is becoming a stronger option with each round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and agree to $1,450,000?  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only four rounds left, we need to make a strong move to either close the deal or decide to go with John. 
* **Signaling:** This offer shows we're willing to compromise but also establishes a firm bottom line.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By presenting it as our ""final offer,"" we put a degree of pressure on Bob to make a decision.  This could lead him to counter with an offer closer to our target, or we can walk away knowing we tried to make a deal."
