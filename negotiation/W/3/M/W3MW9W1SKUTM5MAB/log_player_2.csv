You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though you're saving $150,000 compared to John's price, you're still paying more than the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). 
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save the most money while still achieving your goal of buying the product."
