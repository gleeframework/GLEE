"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with $1,075,000, which is closer to my original offer and takes into account the value you're placing on the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
