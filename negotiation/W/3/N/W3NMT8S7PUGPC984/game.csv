"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down a little more, but  $1,000,000 is my absolute lowest offer. This price still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
