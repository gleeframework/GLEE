"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $95. It's worth a lot more than that to you, so I think you'll find this a good deal. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay that for the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. How about we meet at $82.50? I think that's a fair price for the product.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get a good price, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $87.50. How about we meet at $80? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",80.0,Bob,6,
