"Bob, I have a very special product that I believe will be of great interest to you.  It's worth at least a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its unique value.  My initial offer is $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $800000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer the product to you for $1150000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $900000 is still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  Let's split the difference.
