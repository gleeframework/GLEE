# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000, as that's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000, which is $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $10,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  It's better to cut my losses and buy from John, who is offering a price within my budget."
