"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $8,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still gives you a good profit. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth $8,000 to you, and it's a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000, as that's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000, which is $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my costs. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
