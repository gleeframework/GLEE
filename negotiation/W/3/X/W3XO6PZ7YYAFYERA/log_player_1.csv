"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) gives me a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, allowing room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive, creating a good atmosphere for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price and even lower than his own perceived value.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, hopefully leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is unique and valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $1,250,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and potential benefits, hoping to increase his perceived worth.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** While firm, the message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,180,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,180,000 is still too far off for me.  This product is truly special and offers immense value.  Let's compromise at $1,225,000.  It's a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and your budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly higher price:**  I'm raising the price by a smaller margin compared to my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise but not dropping too low. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's unique qualities and potential benefits to justify the price.
* **Focus on compromise:** I highlight the ""fair price"" and ""compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to pay the full price, but I'd like to meet my budget target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is right at my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. While I would prefer to sell it to John for $1,500,000, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially leading to a lower price."
