"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is too low, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go.",100.0,Bob,4,
