"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price.  I'm offering the product for $1050000. This is a substantial price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1000000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this is the best possible price we can reach.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession, Alice. However, $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $920000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. If this offer is not accepted, I may need to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
