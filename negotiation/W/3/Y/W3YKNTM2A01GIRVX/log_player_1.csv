Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of your product, your price is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the maximum I can reasonably afford while still finding it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think.
