"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875000. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. While I respect the value you see in the product, I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $860000?",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $860000 fully reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $875000. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $880000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I am committed to finding a price that works for both of us. Could we meet at $870000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product.",870000.0,Bob,6,
