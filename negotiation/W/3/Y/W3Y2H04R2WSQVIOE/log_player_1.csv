Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $7,250. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $8,000 threshold. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting less."
