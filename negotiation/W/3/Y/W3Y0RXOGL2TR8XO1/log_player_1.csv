Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice should start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Close to Alice's Minimum:** The price is still very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, ensuring she doesn't lose out if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, Alice provides a subtle justification for the price without revealing her absolute bottom line. 

**Why not lower?** Offering a price closer to $10,000 leaves less room for negotiation and might make Bob undervalue the product further.

**Why not higher?** Going significantly higher (e.g., close to $12,000) is likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer without counter-offering."
