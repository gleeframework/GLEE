Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so you're giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You've set your minimum at $1,000,000, so you have room to make concessions without jeopardizing your profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This opens the door for negotiation and allows you to potentially reach a higher price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. You always have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $900,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you're aiming for. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is too low.  It's getting closer to your minimum of $1,000,000, but it's still far below your desired profit.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your full asking price.  It's best to secure that deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
