"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less to me than you think it's worth to you. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe it's worth the price.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
