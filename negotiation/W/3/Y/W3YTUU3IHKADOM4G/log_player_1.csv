{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not too high that it's immediately rejected. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less to me than you think it's worth to you. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe it's worth the price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while also demonstrating the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum acceptable price and it seems like Bob is serious about this offer.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by pushing for more."
