"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to rush into buying right away. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's always the option to buy from John as a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a significant discount, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A 20% reduction is substantial but not unreasonable, given Bob's willingness to pay up to $15,000. This initial counteroffer allows Bob to see how flexible Alice is and potentially open up a more favorable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. While $13,500 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Considering the remaining rounds, the potential for further negotiation is limited, and there's a risk of Alice getting more stubborn or even increasing her price.  Accepting the offer at this point secures a reasonable price while minimizing risk and potential further haggling."
