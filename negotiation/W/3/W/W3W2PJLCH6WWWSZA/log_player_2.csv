"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is more than her own value for the product, it's still $300,000 cheaper than buying from John.
* **You're still saving money:**  You're getting the product for less than its worth to you, meaning you're saving money compared to your initial valuation."
