"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $98? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $98 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to propose a slight increase to $107. It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the value. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I can do $100, but that's really pushing it for me.",100.0,Bob,6,
