"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $725,000. That's a significant offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's close this deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer, and I appreciate you working with me.  To make this work, I could stretch my budget to $750,000.  I believe that's a very competitive offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $760,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll see it as a great opportunity. Let's finalize this deal!",760000.0,Alice,7,
