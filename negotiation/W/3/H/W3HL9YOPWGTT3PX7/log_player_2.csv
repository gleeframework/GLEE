"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's no way you'll accept that price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $16,000 is a bit out of my range.

Round 3
