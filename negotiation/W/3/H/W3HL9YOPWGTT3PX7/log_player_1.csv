Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $16,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
