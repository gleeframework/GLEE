"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. How about $120? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While it's closer to what I had in mind, could you do $80? I think that's a fair compromise.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is the lowest you're willing to pay, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $80, so how about $100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $90?  That's a bit closer to my budget, and it seems like we're getting closer to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $110? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,7,
