"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price seems a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price. However,  the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you who can maximize its potential, is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
