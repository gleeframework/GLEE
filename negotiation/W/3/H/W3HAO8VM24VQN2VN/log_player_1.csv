I've reached a point where the negotiations are becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming. I've already rejected several offers from Bob that are below my minimum price. While there's a chance I could get a higher price in the next round, it's not guaranteed, and the risk of not reaching a deal with anyone is increasing. It's better to secure a sale with John at my desired price point and avoid further delays."
