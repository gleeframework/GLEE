"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $110?  That gives us both a good deal. ",110.0,Alice,3,
