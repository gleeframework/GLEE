Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product looks promising, but that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the value of this product to me and potentially to you is significantly higher than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we agree on $960,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While his offer is getting closer to John's offer, I still believe I can get a price closer to the product's value with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm matching John's offer here. This puts the pressure on Bob, letting him know I have other options and am serious about this being my best price. He knows the product is worth more and this gives him a last chance to get it at a good price."
