Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115, which is a bit more than my minimum acceptable price of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value of $120, making the offer more appealing. I've also included a friendly message to create a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it, which is closer to my valuation. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price of $115 if I counteroffer. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it, $100 is a little too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm countering with $110, which is a compromise from my initial offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's offer, while also stating my position clearly."
