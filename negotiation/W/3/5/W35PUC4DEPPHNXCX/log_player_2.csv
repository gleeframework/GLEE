"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you first. Would you consider purchasing this for $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. Rejecting this offer allows you to enter negotiations and attempt to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiating requires establishing a starting point. Offering significantly below Alice's asking price creates room for bargaining. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  A low initial offer might prompt Alice to reveal more about her desired price range through her counter-offers.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000. This knowledge gives you leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly above your maximum valuation and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We are gradually increasing our offer to show Alice we are willing to negotiate but not going to meet her initial price.
* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims for a middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current price.
* **Time Constraint:** As the negotiation progresses, reminding Alice you have other options (John's offer) could encourage her to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price. Let's meet in the middle. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is making concessions, but her latest offer is still $100,000 over your maximum budget and John's offer.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile to continue the negotiation. Buying from John guarantees you the product at the best possible price."
