# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you, but I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's a better deal than buying from John, even though it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
