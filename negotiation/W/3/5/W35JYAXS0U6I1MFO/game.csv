"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for it. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $9000? I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle again, at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, $7500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. How about we try $10000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go up to $10000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $8500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we try $9500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but that's as high as I can go.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $10000, Bob. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $10500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",10500.0,Alice,9,

"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,10,
