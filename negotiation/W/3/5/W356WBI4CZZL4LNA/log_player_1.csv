{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's valuation increases the chance of a quick sale at a high profit. By offering it at $1,300,000, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell at any price."
