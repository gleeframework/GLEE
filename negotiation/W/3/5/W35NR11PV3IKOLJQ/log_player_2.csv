"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's a good deal for you. There's no reason to risk finding a worse deal with John."
