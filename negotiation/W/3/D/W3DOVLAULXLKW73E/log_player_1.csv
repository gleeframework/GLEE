Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so there's potential to get a price closer to that.  However, it's also important to be mindful of John's offer of $8,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is your minimum, it's worth trying to get closer to the $9,500 mark.  Bob clearly values the product higher, and this gives you some leverage. We'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum threshold. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower price and spending more time is not worth it. It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John and move on."
