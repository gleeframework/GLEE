Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I am making a profit, but it's still a fair price for Bob, giving him a chance to make a profit as well. This strategy balances my desire to maximize my profit with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and the need to ensure a smooth negotiation."
