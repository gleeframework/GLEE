"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This price reflects its true value to me and leaves room for us both to make a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than you're willing to pay. Considering your offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident the product is worth $825,000 to me, and I'm willing to pay that amount.  This offer is fair and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $825,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to reduce the price by $25,000 and offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
