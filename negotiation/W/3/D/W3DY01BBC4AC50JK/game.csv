"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can see the value in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,400,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,400,000 is still a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,200,000? That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. My revised offer is $1,600,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
