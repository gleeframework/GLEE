"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also framing it in a way that emphasizes the value of the product to him.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but it's closer than my initial offer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a great deal for a product you'll love!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
 
I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $95.  It's a compromise that shows I'm open to negotiation, but still allows me to earn more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can get to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I really think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept his offer of $92.50 as it's a good deal and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  Let's close this deal!"
