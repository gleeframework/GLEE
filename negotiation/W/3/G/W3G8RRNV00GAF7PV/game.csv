"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $14,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
