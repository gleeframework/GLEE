"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a significant discount from my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get closer to $110 by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better deal. I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed $120, but I believe I can get closer to that value with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm again lowering my offer, but still keeping it above Bob's last counteroffer. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I also want to ensure I don't go too low too quickly. I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, hoping to reach a point where he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, he'll be willing to increase his price. However, it's getting very close to my minimum, and I'm starting to consider selling to John.  If Bob doesn't come closer to $100, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  I'm lowering my price to $95. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will agree. If he doesn't, I'll be selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. I've reached my limit, and I don't want to risk going lower. John is a guaranteed sale for $120, which is much better than what Bob is offering. I'm going to sell the product to John."
