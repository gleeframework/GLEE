"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, and that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment, Bob. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to pulling the trigger, but $108 is just a little too much for me. I'm prepared to pay $107, and I truly believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",107.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I can do $109, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,9,
