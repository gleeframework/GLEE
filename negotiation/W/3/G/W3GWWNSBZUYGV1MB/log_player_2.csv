"Round 1
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $120 is too high, and you can likely get a better price. You have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than $120, you still have room to negotiate. You're willing to spend up to $150, so continue to try and bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, and that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. You should continue to negotiate and see if you can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment, Bob. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting close! You've successfully lowered the price significantly from Alice's initial offer, and $108 is within your budget. However, you can still try to get a better deal. One more counteroffer could be enough to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to pulling the trigger, but $108 is just a little too much for me. I'm prepared to pay $107, and I truly believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 107}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I can do $109, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $109, which is very close to your counteroffer of $107.  It's worth accepting this offer, as you've already negotiated a significant discount, and you're only $2 away from your target. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
