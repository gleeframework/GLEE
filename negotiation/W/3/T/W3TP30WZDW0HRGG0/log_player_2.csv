"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $800,000."
