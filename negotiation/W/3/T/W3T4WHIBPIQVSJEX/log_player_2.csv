Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a fair return on my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference?  I'll come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still well within your budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm committed to reaching an agreement, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $820,000. This price is fair to both of us, and we can finally move forward with this deal.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000 at this point, and you're better off securing the product at John's price than risking a higher final price from Alice."
