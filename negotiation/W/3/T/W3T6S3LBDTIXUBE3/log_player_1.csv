"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer to try and find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my target.  I'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  How about $1,025,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,025,000, so how about $987,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John now than risk a lower price with Bob or no deal at all."
