"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'd like to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $10. So, the total value you'll get is $120. How about that?",110.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'll make a final offer of $105, and that's my best and final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $120",105.0,Bob,10,
