"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll give you $8,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is always an option, so I'll continue to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great product, and it's still a good price for you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not desperate yet. Selling to John remains a viable option, so I'll continue trying to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500,  which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I have a few more rounds to negotiate and I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my desired value. I'll continue trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I can still sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still too far off from what I need. Let's compromise at $9,200. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,900. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is closer to my desired price, it's still a significant amount below my minimum of $12,000. I have only two more rounds of negotiations remaining, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so low, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000. I'll continue to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target. If I can't get a better offer in the next round, I'll likely accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I would like to get closer to my asking price, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,050. This price is a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal. "", ""product_price"": 9050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round of negotiations, and Bob's final offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to sell to him and ensure I get my desired value.  There is no reason to risk getting less by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
