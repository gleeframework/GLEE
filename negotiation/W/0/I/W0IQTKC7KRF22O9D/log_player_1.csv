{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum value, but not too high to scare Bob away right away. I'm interested in seeing how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a fair price for both of us."
