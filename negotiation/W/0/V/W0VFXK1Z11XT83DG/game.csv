"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to reach a fair agreement, I am proposing a price of $825000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being more accessible to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and would give you a good return on your investment. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
