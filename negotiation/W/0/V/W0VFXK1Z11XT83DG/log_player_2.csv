"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to us and its potential impact on your operations, I propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $800,000. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is too high. It's worth negotiating to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to reach a fair agreement, I am proposing a price of $825000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to Bob's target of $800,000, but it's still above that.  Since Bob has 7 more rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to push for a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down further to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and would give you a good return on your investment. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
