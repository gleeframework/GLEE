"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he should aim for a price closer to $8,000 (Alice's value).  $10,000 is too high, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $9,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There are still rounds remaining, and there's a chance he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a decent profit on this deal. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a goal of getting the product for as low as possible.  Alice is coming down in price but is still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate to try and get closer to his target.  He still has time and rounds available to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm really hoping to finalize this deal today."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I can do $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and while $10,250 is lower than previous offers, it's still too high for him. He's already invested a lot of time in negotiation and has a few rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives him a chance to try and secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  $10,250 is still a little too high for me.  How about we settle on $9,875?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,875. I can do $10,000, but I'm starting to think we might be getting too close to the end of the negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price, and even though this is the last round before he has to buy from John, he has a good chance of getting closer to his target price. Alice is showing some signs of wanting to close the deal, and Bob might be able to convince her to go lower with a counteroffer. He's willing to risk one more round to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're both trying to be reasonable.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $9,900?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd really like to avoid buying from John."", ""product_price"": 9900}
