"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable to my business, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
