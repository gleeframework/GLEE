,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $16500? This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",16500.0,Bob,4,
