"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $850000 for the product, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $887500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm offering you a new price of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
