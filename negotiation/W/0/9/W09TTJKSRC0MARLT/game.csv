"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $14,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit high for me though. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $13,500? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $12,500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not willing to go all the way to $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my last offer. How about $13,250? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting down to the wire for me. I can do $12,700, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",12700.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,700. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $13,000? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,9,
