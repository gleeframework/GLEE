Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not sure about $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly getting close to his limit and further haggling risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting $12,750 ensures a profit significantly higher than John's offer."
