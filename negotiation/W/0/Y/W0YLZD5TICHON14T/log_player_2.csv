This is a good point to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting a $475,000 discount from John's price and a decent compromise from your initial offer.
* **Time Consideration:** You've already gone through several rounds, and Alice seems firm on this price.  Continuing could risk a stalemate.
* **Final Offer:** Alice indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead her to break off negotiations."
