"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be realistic, I'm thinking closer to $950,000 would make this deal work.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm eager to make this deal happen, $950,000 is unfortunately too far below the product's true value. I can go down to $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair and final offer. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close to a deal that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This reflects my strong interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a fair price. Let's get this done!",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal and your willingness to increase your offer. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.  To finalize the deal with you instead, I'd need you to meet that price. How about it?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
