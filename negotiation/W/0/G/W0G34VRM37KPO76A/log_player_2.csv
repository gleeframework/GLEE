It's time to walk away and take the deal with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,200,000. She's using another potential buyer as leverage.
* **You're too close to your limit:**  Even if you could negotiate Alice down slightly, every dollar over $1,000,000 is eating into your potential savings. 
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $1,000,000. Taking this eliminates risk and guarantees you stay within your budget."
