"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's quite a bit higher than what I'm able to spend right now.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay up to $800000.  Would you be open to negotiating from there?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $800000.  This is the highest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to consider it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $950000, which would be $875000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",875000.0,Alice,9,
