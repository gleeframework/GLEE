"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice.  Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell the product for $8,000, so we know a price below that is highly unlikely to be accepted.
* **Your Value:**  You're willing to pay $15,000, so you have room to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  Offering $9,000 splits the difference between Alice's value and your maximum value. It's a reasonable starting point that allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** We know Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  
* **Your Value:** You are willing to pay $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal than $13,000 by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.
* **Your Value:** You are willing to pay $15,000.
* **Midpoint:** This offer is closer to the midpoint between Alice's value and your value, but still gives Alice some room to negotiate.
* **Previous Offer:** Alice rejected your previous offer of $9,000, so this counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise but still want a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** We know Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.
* **Your Value:** You are willing to pay $15,000.
* **Previous Offers:**  Alice has been unwilling to budge much from her initial offer.  She's now at $13,500.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While you could continue counteroffering, it's unclear if Alice will change her mind. You're now at a price point where accepting is more advantageous. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will keep her price at $13,500 or increase it. Accepting guarantees you get the product for a decent price ($13,500) without potentially risking a higher price or losing time in further negotiations."
