Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a high-end product. Let me know if this works for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's unlikely that Alice will come down further, so it's best to go with the guaranteed price from John."
