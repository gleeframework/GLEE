Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
