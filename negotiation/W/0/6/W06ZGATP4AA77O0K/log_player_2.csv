"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  Bob begins by offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a bargaining position.
* **Showing Willingness:** Bob expresses interest in the product, but emphasizes a price limit. This helps maintain the negotiation without appearing dismissive.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's $15,000 limit and Alice's potential profit margin."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a price even closer to his target while keeping the potential for a deal with Alice alive. 
* **Avoiding Immediate Purchase:**  Buying from John now would be a last resort, as it doesn't allow Bob to leverage potential savings."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. I understand we're close, but $11,750 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11,600. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11600}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11600 and $12000. I'll sell it to you for $11800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One Round Left:**  With only one round remaining, Bob is running out of time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Exceeding Budget:** Alice's offer of $11,800 is still above Bob's target price and budget limit. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While buying from John is not ideal, it's the best option to avoid exceeding his budget with only one round left and Alice refusing to go lower.  Buying from John will allow Bob to purchase the product without further negotiation, ensuring he gets the item. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Time Pressure:** The limited number of rounds significantly impacts Bob's decision.
* **Budget Limits:** Bob's strong commitment to his budget is driving his decision.
* **Potential for Deadlock:** There's a high chance that Alice won't budge in the final round, leading to a failed negotiation.

In this situation, buying from John is the most practical choice to ensure Bob gets the product while staying within his overall financial constraints."
