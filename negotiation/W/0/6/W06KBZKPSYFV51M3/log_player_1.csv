Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $9,500. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer it for less, aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) increases the chance of a sale at a higher profit margin. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even with a smaller profit than John's offer, avoids potential delays and ensures immediate cash flow.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The slightly higher price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum."
