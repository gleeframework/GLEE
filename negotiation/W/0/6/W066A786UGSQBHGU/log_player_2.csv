**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is full of salesmanship, the key takeaway is that she's offering the product for $950,000.  You can get it for $1,000,000 from John. There's no benefit to paying Alice more than you would pay John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer or lets you proceed with John, saving $50,000."
