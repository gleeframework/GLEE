"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. I've carefully considered its unique value, particularly [mention a feature/benefit highly relevant to Bob, ideally one he hasn't fully considered]. Given this, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer highlights a potentially valuable feature, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's more advantageous for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John at a price that fits his budget."
