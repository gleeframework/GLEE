"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $900,000? I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,000,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
