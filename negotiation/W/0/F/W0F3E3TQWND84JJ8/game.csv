"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To be fair, I can come down slightly to $14,000. This feels like a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we are getting close. How about we split the difference and land at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're right, we are close.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my absolute final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
