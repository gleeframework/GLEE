"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial asking price. There's room for negotiation, but accepting such a low offer right away would be a mistake.  I'll try to meet him halfway.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $11,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we are getting close. How about we split the difference and land at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $13,000. That's the best I can do.
