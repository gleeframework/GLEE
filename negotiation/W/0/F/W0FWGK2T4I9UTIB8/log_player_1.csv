Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than your desired price. You can likely squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. 

Let's counter his offer and see if we can get closer to our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward while also showing that you are serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's not the ideal price, $8,800 is closer to your goal than selling to John for $8,000. There's a good chance that if you reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, leaving you with no better option than selling to John. Accepting this offer is the best strategy for maximizing your earnings in this situation."
