"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor the negotiation high, significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential,"" hinting at its value without revealing our own minimum.
* **Leaving Room:** This initial price allows for us to gradually decrease our offer over the remaining rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below Our Minimum:** Accepting $1,600,000 would be a significant loss compared to our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and our target profit.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting, we signal that we value the product higher and are willing to negotiate further. We still have time and the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product offers is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a fairer deal considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession ($250,000) to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, this concession keeps us significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value without revealing our own bottom line.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm above $1,600,000, we maintain pressure on Bob to justify his perceived value and potentially increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,600,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $1,800,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000 and a reasonable compromise.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob has introduced a ""final offer"" ultimatum.  While this could be a negotiation tactic, it also introduces a real risk of him walking away.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate or Bob actually withdrawing. The potential gains from further negotiation are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the $1,800,000 offer."
