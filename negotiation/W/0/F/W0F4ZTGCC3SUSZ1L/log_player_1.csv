"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial price. 
* **First Offer:** This is a first offer, so it's important to start with a reasonable price point. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob is firm about his price, his message indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still room for us to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain some leverage and see if I can get him to come up in price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'll continue to assess the situation and see if it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $12,000 offer, but still remaining above Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's feedback. 
* **Strategic Move:** I'm gauging Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his true value threshold. 

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider the potential of going with John. However, if Bob's counteroffer gets closer to my desired price, I might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob seems willing to budge, but I need to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control and lets me see if I can squeeze out a bit more.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'll be assessing if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500.  
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of this price, suggesting a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Moving Forward:** I'm framing this offer as a way to move forward with the sale, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Assessing Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider going with John. However, I'm still hopeful that I can close the deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll closely watch Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if it's time to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about we meet at $10,750? I think this is a reasonable compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Close to Decision Point:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I need to weigh the potential of a slightly higher offer from Bob against the guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Maintaining Control:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me another opportunity to counter and potentially push for a price closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully consider my options.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer, but I'll also be prepared to accept John's offer if Bob's next offer isn't significantly closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $11,000? This is my absolute bottom line. Let me know if you're able to come up to this price, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This is my final offer, signaling that I'm ready to walk away if necessary.
* **Clear Bottom Line:** I'm stating my absolute bottom line price to show I'm serious about ending the negotiation. 
* **Urgency:** The message creates urgency by mentioning other options, hinting at John's offer. 
* **Weighing Options:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move to John.  However, if Bob accepts, it's a win for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**  This is a crucial round. I'm prepared to either accept John's offer or accept Bob's offer if it reaches my bottom line."
