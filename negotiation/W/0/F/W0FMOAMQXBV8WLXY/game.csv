"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500.
