"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which still represents a significant value for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to invest less, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
