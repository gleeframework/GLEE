"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8500.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $8,500 is still too low, and it seems like he's not willing to budge.  I'd rather sell to John and get the full $10,000."
