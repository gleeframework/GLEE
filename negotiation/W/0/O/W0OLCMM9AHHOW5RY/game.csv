"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $130. Let me know if that works for you!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I think we've been dancing around this price for a while now. I'm not willing to go any lower than $135, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I'll counteroffer at $132. This is the lowest I can go, so let me know if you're willing to meet me here!",132.0,Alice,7,
