"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it will be a worthwhile one for your business. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
