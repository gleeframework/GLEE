"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer but still below my maximum price.  I'm going to reject and counteroffer again to try to get closer to my target price of $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll counteroffer again to try to get closer to my goal.  There are still a few rounds left, so I want to maximize my chances of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $8,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's current price. I'm hoping that this will be a compromise that Alice will accept, especially since we're nearing the middle of the negotiations. If she rejects, I'm prepared to consider buying from John, but I want to see if I can get a slightly better price from Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. There are only a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic. Rejecting and counteroffering again gives me a chance to get a lower price, but if she rejects again, I'll likely need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time to $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's current price. With only two rounds left, I need to get closer to a deal. I'm hoping that this offer will be acceptable to Alice. If she rejects, I'll likely have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  It's unlikely I can negotiate a lower price in the final round. I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid risking a further increase from Alice in the next round."
