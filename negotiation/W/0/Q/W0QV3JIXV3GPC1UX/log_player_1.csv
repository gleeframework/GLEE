"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible. 
* $1,200,000 is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob to reject the offer outright. 
* By starting high, I'm establishing a strong initial position and setting the tone for a profitable negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, and $1,100,000 is still above that.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Bob's offer shows his willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain the leverage to potentially secure a better price in future rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $1,040,000 is not ideal, it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, there's a high chance Bob will continue to lower his offers. 
* **Risk of John's offer:**  If I reject this offer, I risk having to accept John's offer, which is considerably lower.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even if I accept this offer, there's always the potential to negotiate future deals with Bob if our relationship remains positive.

**Overall, given the limited time and the risk of a lower offer from John, accepting Bob's offer of $1,040,000 seems like the most logical and profitable decision at this point.**"
