Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer to Bob, aiming to maximize your profit:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so starting high allows room for negotiation while staying within his potential budget. 
* **Time constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its worth to you, mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" subtly implies the product is valuable and justifies the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go.
* **John as a backup:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale with John. Don't let negotiations with Bob drag on indefinitely, especially if he's unwilling to meet a price that's significantly above your $800,000 minimum."
