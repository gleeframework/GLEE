"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $750000.

What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away from the table, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer you the product for $695000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",695000.0,Alice,9,
