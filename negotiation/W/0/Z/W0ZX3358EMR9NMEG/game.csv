"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is considerably higher than your offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
