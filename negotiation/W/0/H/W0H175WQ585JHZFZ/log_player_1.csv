"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  A higher starting price gives me more leverage in negotiations.
* **Room for compromise:** Even if Bob counteroffers, I have room to lower the price without going below my minimum.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer helps me understand if Bob is a serious buyer who's willing to pay a premium.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my initial offer with a counteroffer.
* **Remaining rounds:**  I still have 8 rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always fall back to John's offer if the negotiations with Bob fall apart.

**Next Step:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer. I'll aim for a compromise around $1,300,000 - $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer to Bob is $1,400,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This price is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, I can lower my price slightly in the following rounds while still remaining above my minimum value of $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

I am aiming for a quick deal in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I am confident that I can secure a price above John's offer, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiations with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good price:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer and is close to my initial target.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away and I'll be left with John's offer.  
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on this deal.

**Decision:**

It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit.  $1,300,000 is a solid outcome considering my minimum value and the limited rounds remaining."
