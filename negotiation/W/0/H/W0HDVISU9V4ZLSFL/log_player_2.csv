"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It immediately establishes the price range I'm considering.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer gives plenty of space for us to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is clear about my budget constraints while remaining respectful and open to further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $10,000?  This would be my absolute minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice has come down a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. It's her ""absolute minimum,"" but I have some wiggle room before I need to consider John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between our positions, suggesting there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer aims to find a compromise. It splits the difference between her last offer ($10,000) and my previous one ($6,000).
* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm stating it's the ""absolute highest"" I can go, it leaves her with a final decision point. She can accept a price that's still a profit for her, or potentially lose the sale.
* **Alternative Option:** By having John's offer in my back pocket, I'm not desperate to close the deal with Alice at any cost. This gives me a stronger negotiating position."
