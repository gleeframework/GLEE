"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential and I'm confident in its value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? I feel that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working on this deal with me, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,220,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $1,220,000 is significantly less than your $1,500,000 maximum and a decent saving compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Continuing to negotiate could make Alice pull out of the deal entirely, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
