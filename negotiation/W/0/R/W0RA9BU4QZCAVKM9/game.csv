"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,375 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
