Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,250 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
