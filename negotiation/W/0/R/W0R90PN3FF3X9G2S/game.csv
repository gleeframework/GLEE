,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $750,000, recognizing the value of the product but also considering its limitations in my current needs. ",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is considerably below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
