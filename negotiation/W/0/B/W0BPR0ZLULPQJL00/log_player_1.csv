"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  While $8,000 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get something closer to $10,000."
