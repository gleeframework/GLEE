"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your ideal price point. You want to see if you can negotiate further and get it closer to your desired $8,000 value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000 for the product.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go down to $8,000 yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to the price I'm hoping to get.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,000, which is a significant compromise. This is a good deal for you, as you're still getting the product for less than your maximum price point of $12,000 and it's closer to your ideal price of $8,000.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a much better deal through further negotiation, and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
