The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $950,000. This is significantly more than you're willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm offering Alice $750,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her asking price, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further."

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay the maximum value I've set for the product, but I won't go any higher. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer."
