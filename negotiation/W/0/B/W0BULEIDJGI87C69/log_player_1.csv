{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm starting with an offer slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, and still allows for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $11,000,  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's valuation."
