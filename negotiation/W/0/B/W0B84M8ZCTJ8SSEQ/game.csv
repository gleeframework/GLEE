"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
