"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000 for this product. It's the most I can afford at the moment. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $17000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested!",17000.0,Alice,5,
