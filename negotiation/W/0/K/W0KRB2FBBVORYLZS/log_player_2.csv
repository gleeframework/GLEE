"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get your money's worth! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $18,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,000. However, I was thinking we could do even better than that. I'm willing to go down to $17,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above your maximum of $15,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and you've already rejected her previous offer at $15,000. To save time and avoid further negotiation, it's best to buy the product from John for your maximum price."
