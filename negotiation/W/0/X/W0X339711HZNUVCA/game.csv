"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds, and I'm open to further negotiations.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920000 is too high, but I'm willing to consider $915000. However, I'm also considering other options, including selling to John for $800000. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $915000. If not, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",915000.0,Alice,7,
