"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and recognize your offer is fair. However, considering the product's unique capabilities and its potential to significantly impact your business, I believe $950000 is a more accurate reflection of its true value.  Let's find a mutually beneficial solution that maximizes your return on investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's capabilities and potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $920000. I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can we discuss further?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference and aim for a final price of $930000. This ensures a fair return for both of us, and it allows you to secure a valuable asset at a price that fits your budget. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.",930000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to that number. Can we discuss some potential concessions or additional benefits that could bring the price down to $915000?",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to consider your proposal for concessions or benefits, but I'd need to see concrete details on how they would truly benefit my product.  However, I'm confident that a price of $925000 is a fair reflection of the value we've discussed.  This compromise acknowledges your budget while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the concessions, and I'm willing to provide some additional information on how they would benefit the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $925000. I'm willing to meet you at $918000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options, including purchasing from John for $1200000. Can we discuss this further?",918000.0,Bob,8,
