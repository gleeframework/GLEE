Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose his potential higher payment.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's enticing to Bob (significantly below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing your profit above the $1,000,000 fallback. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know its value to you is substantial. I'm prepared to make a deal at $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:** $1,350,000 is a significant profit for you ($350,000 above your minimum) and still saves Bob $150,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to slightly adjust your price if needed, but don't go below your $1,000,000 safety net."
