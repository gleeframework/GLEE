Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""safety net.""
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, and you want to keep it that way.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High, But Reasonable:** Don't start at $1,200,000 because there's no room for Bob to feel like he got a deal. 
2. **Leave Negotiation Space:** Aim slightly below Bob's maximum, allowing for some back-and-forth if needed.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value while positioning the price as a considered decision, not just a random number.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit margin ($150,000 above your minimum) while still being attractive to Bob, as it saves him $50,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, you have room to go down slightly while still securing a great deal."
