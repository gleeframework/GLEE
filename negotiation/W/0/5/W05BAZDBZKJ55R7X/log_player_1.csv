I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but it's also not so high that it's immediately unreasonable to Bob.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little more than his initial offer, but still get a good deal."

Bob seems to be firm on $10,000.  Since that's my minimum acceptable price, and I have another buyer waiting, it makes more sense to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation."
