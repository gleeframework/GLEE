"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which serves as my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's counteroffer is essentially my floor price. I'm not losing money here, but I can still try to squeeze out a bit more. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 more rounds, so rejecting his offer allows me to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer:** John is my safety net, but I'm not in a rush to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $150 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $160. It's still a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive language:** I'm emphasizing a ""good price for both of us,"" encouraging Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's make this happen"" adds a subtle sense of urgency,  potentially pushing Bob toward accepting. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a small increase while leaving space for further negotiations in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $145 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited rounds:** We're already in round 4, and with limited remaining rounds, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.
* **John's offer:**  John is offering my minimum price, guaranteeing me a profitable sale. 

**Conclusion:** It's more strategically sound to sell to John at this point.  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price with Bob, the risk of reaching the end of the rounds with no deal is too high. John's offer provides a surefire way to meet my minimum goal."
