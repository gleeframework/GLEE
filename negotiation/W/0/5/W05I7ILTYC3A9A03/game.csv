"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price point is too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This represents a significant investment on my end, but I believe the product has the potential to be valuable.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
