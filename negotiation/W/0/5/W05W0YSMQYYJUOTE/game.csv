"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $88 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal.",91.0,Alice,5,
