{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands exactly what you're proposing. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still only comfortable with $88. Let's split the difference, and I'll take it off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $88 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $91.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 91}
