"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $950000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I am proposing a revised price of $900000 for our product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However,  $900000 is still above what I can realistically afford. Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $850000. This price is a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue working together.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued cooperation, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I believe we can find a suitable arrangement. I propose a price of $875000 for our product. This price is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers and should be within your budget while still providing a good return for us. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties.",875000.0,Alice,5,
