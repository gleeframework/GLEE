"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should see if he can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7000. How about we meet in the middle at $8200? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $8,200 is a good deal, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will go lower before moving on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,200 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7,000. How about we settle at $7,500? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8100? It's a small step back from my original price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made a good amount of progress, getting Alice down from her initial $9,500 to $8,100. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might get stubborn and refuse to go any lower.  With only 5 rounds left, it's likely a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product at a price significantly lower than John's $15,000."
