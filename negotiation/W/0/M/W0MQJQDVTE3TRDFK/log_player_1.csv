Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will be very telling. If he accepts, you've secured a great price. If he counters, you can begin negotiations. His counter-offer will also give you insight into how much he values the product.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in your negotiation with Bob. You're not desperate to sell, so you can afford to be firm in your pricing."
