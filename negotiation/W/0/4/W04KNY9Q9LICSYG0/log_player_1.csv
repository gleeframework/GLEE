"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and how it's a great deal for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) as possible without losing Bob.  I'll adjust my offers based on his responses and the remaining rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, I still believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for further negotiations. I'll also emphasize the product's value and why my counteroffer is still fair.  I'll keep track of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still represents a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired price:**  I'm offering $8,500, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm emphasizing the idea of meeting in the middle to show flexibility and encourage Bob to compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution by offering a price that's reasonable for both of us. I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds, always keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While closer to my minimum acceptable price, $7,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation window is closing:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure to reach a deal is increasing.  
* **John's offer is tempting:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a very real option that I'm considering seriously. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll also be more firm in my negotiations. I'll emphasize the product's value and my own financial needs. I'll assess if Bob's willingness to compromise is genuine or just a tactic, and adjust my offers accordingly. I'm not afraid to walk away if the deal doesn't meet my minimum requirements."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the gap:** I'm reducing my offer to $8,000, showing flexibility and moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Time pressure:** I'm reminding Bob that we have limited time left, creating a sense of urgency to reach an agreement. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximizing value:** I'm trying to secure a price as close as possible to my desired value while still leaving some room for compromise.
* **Balancing risk:**  I'm assessing the likelihood of Bob accepting this offer and weighing it against the risk of selling to John for $12,000.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
