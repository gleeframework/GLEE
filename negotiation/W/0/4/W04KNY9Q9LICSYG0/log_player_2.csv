Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe it's a fair price."",

}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still represents a great deal for you considering the product's potential.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $7,500 is still below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
