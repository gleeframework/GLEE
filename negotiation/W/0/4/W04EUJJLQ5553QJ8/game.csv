"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
