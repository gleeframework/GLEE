"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be significantly lower.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  If you're willing to meet me closer to my budget, I'm very interested. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product.  $1,125,000 is my absolute lowest price.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
