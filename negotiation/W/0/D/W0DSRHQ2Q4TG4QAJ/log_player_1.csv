Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for significant room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly.  Remember, I have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I risk losing a sale if I continue to negotiate, and with John's offer of $800,000, I'm confident I can secure a good deal."
