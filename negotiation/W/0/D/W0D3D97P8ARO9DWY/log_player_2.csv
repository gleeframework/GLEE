# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the potential this product holds.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $900,000 undervalues what this product brings to the table.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down on her price, her final offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go any lower and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at my desired price point."
