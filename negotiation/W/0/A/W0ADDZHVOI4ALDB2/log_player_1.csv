Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
