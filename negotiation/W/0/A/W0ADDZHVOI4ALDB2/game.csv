"Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,150,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,175,000. Can you consider this price?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
