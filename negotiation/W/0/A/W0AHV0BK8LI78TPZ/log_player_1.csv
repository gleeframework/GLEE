"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering $180. This is still above my minimum and allows for some potential bargaining room in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $170 is close enough to my desired price, and I don't want to risk him walking away or getting a lower price from John."
