Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  It's also significantly higher than John's offer, making it more likely Bob will negotiate instead of walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is closer to my desired value."
