"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still provides a good value for you, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product, while also being more reasonable for me. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
