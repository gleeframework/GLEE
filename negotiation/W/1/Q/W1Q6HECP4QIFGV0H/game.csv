"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000.  This feels like a fair starting point, given its potential.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After evaluating the situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers you a substantial return on investment, considering its worth to you. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its value to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
