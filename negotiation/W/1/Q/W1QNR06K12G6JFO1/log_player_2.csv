"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is quite high. Let's try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for bargaining and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  While I'm countering aggressively, I want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Target Price:** My ideal price is much lower than $14,000.  By starting at $10,000, I'm hoping to steer the negotiation towards a price point that works for me while still leaving Alice room to potentially make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still closer to her initial offer than mine. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  I'm moving closer to the middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a significant discount from her last offer of $13,000.
* **Clear and Direct:** I'm stating my desired price clearly and confidently, while still maintaining a collaborative tone. 
* **Pressure Point:**  I'm getting closer to my walk-away point (buying from John at $15,000). By suggesting $11,000, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to make a deal before I potentially look elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $12,500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $12,500 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer of $14,000 and a reasonable compromise from my last counteroffer of $11,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I'm happy with the current price. 
* **Avoiding John's Price:** While I could walk away and buy from John, it would cost me an extra $2,500. Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids that extra expense."
