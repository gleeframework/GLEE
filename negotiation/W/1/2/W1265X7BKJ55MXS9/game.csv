"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant reduction from the original price. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this offer?",910000.0,Bob,6,
