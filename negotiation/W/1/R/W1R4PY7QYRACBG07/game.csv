"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000.
