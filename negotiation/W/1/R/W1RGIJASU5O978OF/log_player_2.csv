# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also being a bit more reasonable for you. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge too much from my original offer.

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offer is still too high for him.  It's now more advantageous to purchase the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
