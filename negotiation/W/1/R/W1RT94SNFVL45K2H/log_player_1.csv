{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It's within Bob's range:** $115 is still below Bob's maximum value of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation dynamic. 

If Bob rejects, we'll adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $105 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going, giving you the chance to potentially get closer to your desired price. 

* **Why not sell to John?**  Selling to John guarantees $120, but there's a chance you can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 

You'll now need to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $110 is still within Bob's maximum value of $100, but closer to your desired price. 
* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate helps keep Bob engaged. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves space for Bob to counteroffer if he wants, allowing the negotiation to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $108 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  

* **Why not sell to John?** You are close to John's price and might be able to get a better offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

You'll now need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  You might consider offering $112 as a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $112? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $112 is a compromise between your previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $108.
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighting the benefits of a compromise and a ""win-win"" situation can encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Final push:** This counteroffer is likely the last before you'd be better off selling to John. It's a calculated risk to see if Bob will accept."
