"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of offering $108 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $112? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",112.0,Alice,5,
