Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we aim to get as close to our minimum acceptable price ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below $15,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing our potential profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, ensuring we don't lose money.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while securing a guaranteed sale."
