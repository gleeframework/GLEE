"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your desired profit margin and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for a healthy profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering your profit margin and my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service package worth $20,000. This brings the total value of the deal to $1,020,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer and the added value of the service package. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. To make this work, I'm proposing a price of $1,010,000, which includes the service package. This way, we both get a fair deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're still keen on the service package, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,010,000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty extension that's worth $10,000. This brings the total value of the deal to $1,020,000. I think this is a fair compromise that meets both our needs.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
