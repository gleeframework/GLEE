"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $98. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
