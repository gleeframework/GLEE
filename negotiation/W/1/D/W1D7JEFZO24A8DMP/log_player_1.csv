Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
