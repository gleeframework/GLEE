{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is significantly above Bob's valuation of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. 
* **Message:**  I am framing the offer as fair and reasonable, while subtly emphasizing the product's value to Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting at a price that is relatively high, I can gauge Bob's level of interest and his willingness to negotiate. I have a fallback option with John, so I am not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* While I am willing to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still provides significant value to you, while also allowing me to recover a reasonable portion of the product's worth.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000. It's closer to my desired range and still offers Bob a good deal considering his valuation.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making and highlighting the value the product still offers to Bob at this price. This approach aims to create a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me. By offering a counter-offer that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, I am hoping to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative with my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a much more profitable option.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  By demonstrating my unwillingness to settle for a low price, I hope to encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 is still too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows you to get a valuable product at a price that's within your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This price is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a comfortable profit margin.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Bob's situation while reaffirming the value of the product and framing the offer as a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's but not drastically lower, I aim to show a willingness to negotiate while keeping the bargaining power.  This could encourage Bob to meet me halfway, resulting in a more favorable outcome than accepting his current offer or selling to John."
