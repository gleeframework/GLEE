# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and prove to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. You're still aiming for the best possible deal, and you have a safety net with John's offer. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the chance to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to your target price."
