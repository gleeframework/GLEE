"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. ",105.0,Bob,4,
