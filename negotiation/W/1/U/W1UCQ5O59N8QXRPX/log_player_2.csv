# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,175,000 is still above my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I'm starting to feel like we're reaching an impasse.  Given that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to take that deal and avoid further haggling."
