"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your asking price than my previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
