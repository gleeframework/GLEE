"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000.
