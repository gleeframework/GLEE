Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits to Bob. 
* This strategy allows for a potential back-and-forth negotiation while still protecting my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I can assess if his counteroffer is acceptable or if I should move forward with John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I believe I can still secure a higher price through further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to budge. This keeps the negotiation dynamic and increases the chance of securing a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** The message highlights that this price is a good deal for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a price above my minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I'm showing flexibility to encourage a deal. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my position of aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that further rounds will only lower the price further. John has already offered my desired value of $1,500,000, providing a guaranteed profit. 

Given the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob, it's strategically better to accept John's offer and secure the highest possible price. This minimizes risk and maximizes my potential earnings."
