"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity, as the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to create urgency, her offer of $1,100,000 is still less than your maximum price of $1,200,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000."
