Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my true minimum. 

This approach aims to:

*  Get a high starting point.
*  Encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
*  Leave room for compromise without jeopardizing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $15000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum ($12,000) but still leaves room for me to negotiate. I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer but not going too low. I want to stay above my minimum while still being reasonable.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and a good deal for both parties.
* **Urgency:** ""Let's see if we can finalize this"" subtly adds a little pressure and encourages a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to meet at $16500. My maximum budget is $15000. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been firm on $15,000, and I'm getting closer to my minimum. It's a risk to keep negotiating, as I might end up selling to John for less. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a decent profit, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price."
