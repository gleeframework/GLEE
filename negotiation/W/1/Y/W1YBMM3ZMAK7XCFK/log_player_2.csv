Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $650,000? "",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $900,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer.  I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's settle at $825,000. This is a fair offer considering the quality and potential of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still better off buying from John at this point.  One more counteroffer should make it clear whether a deal with Alice is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $800,000.  If you're willing to match that price, I'm ready to close the deal with you today."",
