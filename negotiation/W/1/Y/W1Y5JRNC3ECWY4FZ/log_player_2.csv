Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'm also willing to make a compromise. How about we meet at $950,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the point where I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950,000 was too high, but I can do $920,000?

Round 9

It's time to move on to my backup option with John."
