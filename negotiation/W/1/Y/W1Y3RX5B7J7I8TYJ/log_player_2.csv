"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your budget. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $102.50 is better than her previous offer, it's still above your budget.  You are aiming for a price closer to $80, so you should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $102.50 is still a little high for me.  How about we settle on $90?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25? This would be a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is willing to negotiate, her current offer of $96.25 is still above your budget of $80. You are determined to save as much money as possible, and you know that John is willing to sell the product to you for $80.  Therefore, buying from John is the best option to maximize your savings."
