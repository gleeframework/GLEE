{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum. This is a strategic move:

* **Maximizes potential profit:** It sets the bar high, allowing for potential negotiation down the line.
* **Gauges Bob's interest:**  If Bob accepts, great! If not, his counteroffer will tell me how much he values the product. 

I'll be ready to negotiate based on Bob's response, and I'll always have John as a backup buyer at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but it's still above my ideal price point.  I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, but if it's unsuccessful, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```
 
This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still trying to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that this offer is still attractive to Bob while ensuring I don't leave too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $13750 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $500 away from my initial counteroffer.  At this point, I think it's worthwhile to accept his offer and secure a sale. It's closer to my ideal price than John's offer, and it avoids further negotiation."
