This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $7,100 is a good price, saving you $900 compared to John's offer.
* **Final offer:** Alice stated this is her final offer, pushing further might make her walk away. 
* **Limited time:**  You have limited rounds, and continuing might not yield a significantly better result."
