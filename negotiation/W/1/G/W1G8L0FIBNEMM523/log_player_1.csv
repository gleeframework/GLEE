Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is lower than yours, it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $135 is a price point that potentially benefits both of you. You're getting more than your minimum ($150), and Bob is getting a price lower than his perceived value ($120).
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($150), so you're not desperate to sell below your minimum. This strengthens your position. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters or shows hesitation."
