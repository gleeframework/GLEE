# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, allowing you to save even more."
