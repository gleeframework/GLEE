I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This leaves room for negotiation, while still being above my minimum price. I'm hoping to secure a good price while also giving Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse deal than John's offer is too high.  Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option right now."
