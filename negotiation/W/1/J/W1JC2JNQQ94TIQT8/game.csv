"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,600,000.  Perhaps we could explore if there are additional elements I can include to bridge the difference?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
