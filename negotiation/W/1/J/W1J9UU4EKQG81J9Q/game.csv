"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you $825000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $950000, which is $887500. I'm counteroffering at $900000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,,
