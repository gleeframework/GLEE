"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $60, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  $45 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $55 is still above my desired price point.  I will continue to negotiate to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below $55. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but not willing to overpay."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $52 is getting close to my desired price point.  While I'd prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at $120. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price with some savings."
