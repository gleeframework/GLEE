{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.  It also sets a positive tone by focusing on mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would like to secure a higher price, I will not accept such a low offer.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum of $800,000.  There's a risk of further negotiation dragging on and lowering the price even more.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves me time and energy."
