"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. Let's split the difference - how about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll love the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'd like to add a little extra value to the deal. How about we throw in a bonus feature that's worth $10? That would bring the total price to $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
