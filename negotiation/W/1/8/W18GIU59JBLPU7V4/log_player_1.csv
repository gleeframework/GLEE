Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum and even below John's standing offer. I need to steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think $1,050,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to my target, Bob's offer is still below what I can get from John. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to signal that I'm prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is moving closer to my price, and this offer is a good deal better than John's. There's a risk Bob might not go higher, and I don't want to lose the sale entirely."
