"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $950,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I think $1,050,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, but this is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current positions, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
