Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  I understand you're working within a budget, but consider this: this product has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business, exceeding what you're currently offering.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our positions and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!
