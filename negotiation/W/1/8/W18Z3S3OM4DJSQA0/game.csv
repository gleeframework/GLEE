"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,200,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me to accept.  I understand you're working within a budget, but consider this: this product has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business, exceeding what you're currently offering.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our positions and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
