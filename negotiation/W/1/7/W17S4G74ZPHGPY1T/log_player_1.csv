Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel more inclined to negotiate rather than just rejecting outright.
* **Focus on value:**  Mentioning the product's usefulness subtly reinforces its value to Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the price slightly:** I can try to meet him halfway.
* **Counter-offering aggressively:**  If he offers a very low price, I might need to counteroffer more firmly to get closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John:** If the negotiation stalls or Bob's offers are too low, I'll be ready to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $95 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  I have room to counter-offer and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While John offers a guaranteed $120, I want to see if I can get closer to that by negotiating with Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. For example, I could offer $105, explaining that $95 is too low for me, but I am willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $105, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows that I am willing to negotiate but still value the product. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting ""fair price for both of us"" implies a win-win situation, which is appealing to Bob.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to consider lowering the price further or selling to John. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob makes another counteroffer, I'll be ready to negotiate based on the new offer and my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. However, I still think I can find a better deal elsewhere. Could you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, there's a chance he might walk away and I'd be left with only the option to sell to John.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I might be able to find another buyer for a better price in that time.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $100.  
* I'll learn from this experience to be more prepared for future negotiations, potentially starting with a lower initial price to allow for more room to negotiate."
