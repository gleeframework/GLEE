Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, I start with a price slightly below my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" creates a sense of urgency and value, making Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering it at $95, I leave a gap where Bob might try to negotiate down, potentially still landing above my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell it to John for my desired amount."
