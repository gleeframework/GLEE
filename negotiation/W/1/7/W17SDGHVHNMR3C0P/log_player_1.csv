"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial arrangement,"" signaling your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.** 
2. **Potentially secure a deal quickly** if Bob is highly motivated.
3. **Establish a strong starting point** for negotiation even if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is now above his initial valuation ($1,000,000), it's still significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price.  You have plenty of room to negotiate and rounds remaining.  Selling to John right now would be a safe option but would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000? This reflects my initial investment and acknowledges your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob ""halfway"" is a strong negotiating tactic. While not a true 50/50 split, it creates that perception and might make him more amenable.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your ""initial investment,"" you re-emphasize that your price isn't arbitrary.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps you well above your $1,500,000 minimum, providing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal if we stay closer to my initial offer. I'm happy to come up to $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which shows he's interested. However, $1,300,000 is still below your guaranteed sale price with John. You have time and room to negotiate further. A rejection here keeps the pressure on Bob while signaling you're not settling for less than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** A smaller concession this round ($150,000) signals that you're getting closer to your bottom line.
* **Appeal to Emotion:**  Highlighting your desire to see the product with Bob adds a personal touch and suggests you're invested in more than just the money.
* **Firm but Fair:** The language is still positive, but ""significant compromise"" subtly emphasizes that you're nearing your limit.

This counteroffer:

1.  **Maintains a strong position:** Keeps the price well above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum.
2.  **Encourages a serious response:** Bob is more likely to counter with a substantial increase, understanding your flexibility is decreasing. 
3.  **Preserves the option to walk away:** If Bob doesn't meet you closer to your price, selling to John is still a viable and profitable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your effort to reach a deal. However, $1,600,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. If you're truly committed to selling, I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both recognize in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). 
* **Strong Profit:** While not your ideal price, you're still securing a significant profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might not reach your desired price, forcing you to settle for John's offer. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome.

Bob's language (""fair price,"" ""value we both recognize"") suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Taking this deal secures a strong profit and avoids the potential for negotiation fatigue or losing the sale altogether."
