"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

*  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals your desired price range.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
