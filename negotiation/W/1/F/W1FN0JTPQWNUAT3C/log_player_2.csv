"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, I can attempt to get a lower price. I'm not in a rush, so I can afford to try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. However, I think there's still potential to get the price down further. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final counteroffer of $725,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer again and I'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget than risk losing out on the deal entirely."
