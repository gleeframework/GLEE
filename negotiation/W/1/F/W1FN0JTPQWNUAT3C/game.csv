"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700,000. This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",725000.0,Alice,5,
