"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can do $700,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $700,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",850000.0,Alice,5,
