"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,200. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm hoping this will be close enough to his offer that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price one more time to $11,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe Bob is close to my ideal price and I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. Bob's offer of $10,700 is a decent price, and I'm willing to accept it at this point."
