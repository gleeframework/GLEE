"I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's meet in the middle again and go with $10,875.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10875.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,875, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting very close to a deal. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. However, I'm also aware that we're getting close to the deadline, and I don't want to miss out on other opportunities. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
