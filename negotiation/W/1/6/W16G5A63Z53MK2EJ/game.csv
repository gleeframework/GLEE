"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a bit lower than I can accept right now, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $16,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. I really think this product would be a great fit for me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately $13,500 is still a bit below where I can go. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  How about we settle on $14,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. ",14250.0,Alice,5,
