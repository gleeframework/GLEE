Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's estimated value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making it clear that the price is justified. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, I have a better chance of securing a higher price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer option keeps me in control of the negotiation.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  The option to sell to John provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he is willing to pay more than $1,000,000. 
* **Leveraging John as a safety net:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **Increase Bob's willingness to pay:** By showing I'm not desperate for a sale, I might push Bob to increase his offer.
* **Avoid settling for a low price:** I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product to you while still being reasonable for me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm making a counter-proposal that is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Meeting halfway:** I'm positioning this as a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiation position:** By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I show I'm not desperate and have leverage.
* **Increase the potential of a successful negotiation:** By offering a compromise, I'm making it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Secure a higher price than John's offer:** I'm aiming for a price that is significantly higher than John's offer while staying within Bob's budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I could go up to $1,175,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $1,175,000 is a slight increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob's willingness to increase his offer suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show my commitment to my minimum price:**  I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, which signals my resolve.
* **Potentially push Bob to a higher offer:**  By not accepting, I might encourage Bob to increase his offer to reach a deal.
* **Avoid settling for a price that is too low:** I'm not willing to accept a price that is less than the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm again proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting a final offer to push Bob towards a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiation position:**  While lowering my price, I'm still significantly above Bob's last offer.
* **Increase the chances of closing the deal:**  By offering a compromise and creating a sense of urgency, I'm increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $1,185,000.  If you cannot accept this, I will have to go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $1,185,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer, and rejecting it could result in losing the deal altogether.
* **John offers a safe backup:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Secure a sale:**  I'm guaranteed to sell the product for a price that's close to my minimum.
* **Avoid potential negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a lower final offer.
* **Minimize the risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's final offer could lead to losing him as a buyer and potentially not securing a deal with John either."
