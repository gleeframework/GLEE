"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product to you while still being reasonable for me.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
