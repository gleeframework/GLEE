{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a positive impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8500. How about we split the difference and go with $8250? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
