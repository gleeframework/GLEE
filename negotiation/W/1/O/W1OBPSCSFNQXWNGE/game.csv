"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $90 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $70.  Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $85. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle right in the middle at $77.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",77.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can offer it to you for $82.50. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",82.5,Alice,7,
