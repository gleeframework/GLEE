"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair profit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, Bob, but $8,500 is still a bit short for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $10,000, which would be $9,250. That's my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,7,
