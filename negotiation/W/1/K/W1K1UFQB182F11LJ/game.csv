"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers tremendous value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
