"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's, but Bob can likely do better. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** Alice values the product at $10,000.
* **Bob's budget:** Bob's maximum budget is $12,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. 

This counteroffer aims to initiate a negotiation where Bob can hopefully secure a price closer to his ideal range while still leaving Alice with a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $11,200 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it's closer to his maximum budget of $12,000.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is higher, Bob can still potentially get a better deal with Alice.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to bring the price down even further.

By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation open and demonstrates his willingness to continue bargaining for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** Alice values the product at $10,000.
* **Bob's budget:** Bob's maximum budget is $12,000.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Bob has already offered $10,500 and Alice countered with $11,200.  Offering $10,800 represents a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway. This gives Alice a decent profit while still being within Bob's budget. 

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price, aiming to reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $11,400 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is higher, Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation.
* **Negotiation strategy:** At this point, the negotiation has gone on for a while. Accepting the offer is a good way to finalize the purchase without risking further delays or a higher price with John. 

While $11,400 is not the ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that secures the product for Bob at a price that's within his budget."
