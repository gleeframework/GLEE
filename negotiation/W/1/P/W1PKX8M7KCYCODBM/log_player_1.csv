Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects a fair value based on my own assessment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. Let me know your thoughts.
