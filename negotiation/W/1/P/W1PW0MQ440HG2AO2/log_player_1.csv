Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in relatively small increments.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($150).  Cutting your losses now and selling to John guarantees a better profit."
