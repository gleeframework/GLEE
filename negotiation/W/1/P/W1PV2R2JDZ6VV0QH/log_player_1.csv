"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm going to try and get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my first offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $95. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully will be attractive enough to Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking getting a lower price or having to sell to John."
