"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is offering $1,200,000 for the product, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal.  It's likely Alice will counter, but this price puts the ball in her court and shows Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if she'll come down closer to $1,500,000.  If not, Bob can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is offering $1,400,000, which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. This demonstrates that he is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better price.  It's likely Alice will either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,700,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  One more counteroffer could potentially get Alice closer to his price point, and if not, he can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

Bob is offering $1,600,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer but still lower than Alice's current price. This demonstrates that he is willing to compromise but is not willing to overpay. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or make a final counteroffer closer to Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has come down a bit, but her price is still higher than what John is offering. This is a good time to stop negotiating and get the product for a price he's comfortable with."
