Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $125 is better than his initial valuation, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm concerned that he's not going to budge much further. I've already rejected a few of his offers, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away completely. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John for $150, which is well above my minimum price."
