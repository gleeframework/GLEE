# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm genuinely interested in the product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $175. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my $120 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $150?  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already mentioned to you that I need to make a profit, and $150 is the minimum I can sell it for. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'm not willing to go lower. So, I'm sticking with my minimum price of $150. If you're really interested, I'm willing to sell it to you at this price, but I'm not budging further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $150 is still above my budget. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating. Even though she's stated this is her minimum, it's worth a final counter-offer to see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is my absolute maximum.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I've already told you that $150 is my minimum price. I'm not willing to go lower than that. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount since you're willing to meet me halfway. I can offer you the product for $155, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my budget.  While she's indicated she's willing to meet me ""halfway,"" it's clear she's not going to budge much further.  I've already made a counteroffer that she rejected, and I'm not sure I'll get her any lower. Since I have the option to purchase the product from John for $120, I'm going to choose to go that route and avoid further negotiation."
