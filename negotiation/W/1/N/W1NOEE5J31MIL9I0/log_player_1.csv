"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay close to my desired amount right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale rather than risk losing him and having to settle for John's lower price."
