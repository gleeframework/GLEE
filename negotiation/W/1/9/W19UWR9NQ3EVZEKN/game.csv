"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your desire to get a good price, $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  ",14000.0,Bob,4,
