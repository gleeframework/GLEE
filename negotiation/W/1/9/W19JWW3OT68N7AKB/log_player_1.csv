{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's above my minimum but leaves some room for bargaining. I believe this is a good starting point, allowing me to potentially secure a higher price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think it's a great product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we try $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I am still confident that I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. This is a significant price for me, so I hope you'll consider it. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $12,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is $12,000. This is right at my minimum acceptable price, and I am confident that I will not be able to get a higher offer from Bob. I am also worried that continuing to negotiate might scare him off.  Therefore, I will accept his offer and sell the product to him."
