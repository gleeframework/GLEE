Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $750,000.  This would allow us both to make a fair profit and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.
