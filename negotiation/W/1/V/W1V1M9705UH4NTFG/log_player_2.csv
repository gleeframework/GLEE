Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a strong opening offer that shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets a firm limit.  If Alice is willing to accept this, it's a win for me. If not, we can continue negotiating."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than my maximum budget. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin.  $14,000 is a good compromise, and it shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal. With only two rounds left, it's crucial to find common ground. If Alice accepts, it's a good outcome for both of us. If she rejects, I'll be prepared to consider buying from John in the next round."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
