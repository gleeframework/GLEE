"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, and $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $900,000 to make it worth my while. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",850000.0,Alice,5,
