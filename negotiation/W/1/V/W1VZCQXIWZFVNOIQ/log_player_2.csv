"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I'm looking for a price of $1,200,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, and $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $900,000 to make it worth my while. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's offer. You've made good progress with the negotiation, but you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 and it makes sense to take it at this point."
