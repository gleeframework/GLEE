"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $9,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating a lower price. This price is still within Bob's budget, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired $8,000.  There are still rounds left to achieve this goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,200. This would allow us both to make a fair deal, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, but it still keeps Bob within his budget.  It also demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties. By proposing a price that is closer to Alice's target, it increases the chances of her accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $8,600? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired $8,000. There are still rounds left to achieve this goal, and Bob can leverage the fact that Alice has already reduced her price significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,600 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8400}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing a price that is only $400 above his maximum budget, demonstrating a genuine effort to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price, while still staying within Bob's financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,400, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm going to make one more push, and then I'll have to consider other options. How about we try $8,800 again? I'm willing to take a bit of a risk, but I think it's worth it to get the best deal for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, and the negotiation seems to be going in circles.  There are only three rounds left. Given the limited time and the fact that John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
