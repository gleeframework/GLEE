"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price of $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $200,000."
