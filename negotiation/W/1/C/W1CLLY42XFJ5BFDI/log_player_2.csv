"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He has a maximum budget of $10,000 and Alice's offer is $2,000 over that. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. I'm really interested in this product, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9000. How about we settle on $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's also very close to his budget, so going to John is still a good option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,000?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $10000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He has already rejected a lower price from Alice, and the offer from Alice is getting further from his budget. Buying from John ensures he gets the product at his desired price."
