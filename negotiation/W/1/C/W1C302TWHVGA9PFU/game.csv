"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product.  However, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, considering the price I could get from John. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is significantly below its true value.  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the market value and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Bob,4,
