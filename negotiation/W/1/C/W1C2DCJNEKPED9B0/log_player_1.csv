Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to potentially earn more if Bob accepts.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation process. 

Remember, I'm playing the role of Alice, so I'm always looking to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even below his perceived value. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to try and meet in the middle. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? That's my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price, and it's getting close to his perceived value, leaving little room for further negotiation. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since John is offering a guaranteed $12,000.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John."
