"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be feasible?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must be upfront - $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. I have another buyer interested at that price, but I believe this product holds more value for you and would prefer to see it in your hands. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
