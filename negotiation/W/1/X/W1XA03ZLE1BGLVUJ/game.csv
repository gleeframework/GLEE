"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more than John's price, but I'm still trying to save some money. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $8,500 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $8,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know what you think!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,750 is still too far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference? $8,875 would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
