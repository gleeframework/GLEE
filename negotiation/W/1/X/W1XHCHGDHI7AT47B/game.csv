"While I appreciate your offer, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're not willing to go lower than $13000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000.  This price is fair, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above $12000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $13250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",13250.0,Alice,5,
