"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer in the next round.  $9,000 is above Bob's budget and he can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer again.  While $8,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better deal.  He might be able to get a price closer to his $7,500 offer with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a concession by meeting you halfway in the last round. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can do $8,200 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $8,200 is getting close to his budget, he's still over his ideal price.  He can likely get a better deal with another counteroffer or by buying from John if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,200 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us and within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in a small bonus for you, and I'll sell the product to you for $8,200, but I'll give you a $200 discount on a future purchase from me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget:** Even with the added discount for a future purchase, Alice's price of $8,200 is still over what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Time is running out:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left to negotiate with Alice. There's a risk that they won't reach an agreement, leaving Bob with no product and potentially missing out on a better deal with John.
* **John's price is guaranteed:** John is offering the product at Bob's maximum price point. There's no risk of further negotiation or potential for a higher price with John.

Buying from John provides Bob with certainty, avoids potential delays, and ensures he stays within his budget."
