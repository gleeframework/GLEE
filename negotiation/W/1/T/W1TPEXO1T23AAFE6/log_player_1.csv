Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. $9,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. There's always a chance that I could get a better offer in the next round, but I don't want to risk losing Bob completely."
