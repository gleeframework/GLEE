"Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm aware of its worth to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair to both of us. My asking price is $1,050,000.  This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
