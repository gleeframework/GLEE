Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I can do $9,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

At this point, Alice has come down to $9,000, but you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000. It's unlikely Alice will go that low, so it's best to secure the deal with John and save the $1,000."
