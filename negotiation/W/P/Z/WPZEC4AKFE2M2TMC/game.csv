"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $8,200. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
