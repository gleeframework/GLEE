I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. There are still rounds left, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is still a great value considering the product is worth $10,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
