Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) and gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **The message** is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

By setting a price slightly above the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation amicable. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer just yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and continue the negotiation. This will allow me to explore if I can reach a higher price than $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100** is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **The message** remains positive and acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of my product.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. If Bob accepts, I secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to either lower my price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than what John is offering. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the deal with Bob and potentially ending up with the lower price from John.  While $85 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good deal and secures a sale without further negotiation."
