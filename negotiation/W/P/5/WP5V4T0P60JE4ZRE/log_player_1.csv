Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's also important to note that I'm not yet sure how much Bob values the product, so starting high allows me to potentially get a better price. If Bob rejects, I can always lower my price, but starting high gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than my minimum, it's still below my initial target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  Even though it's still a bit less than my ideal, it's a good deal considering the potential for further haggling. Accepting this offer maximizes my immediate profit."
