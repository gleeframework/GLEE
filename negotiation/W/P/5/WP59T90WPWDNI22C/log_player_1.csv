"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's $100,000 above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further discussion, implying flexibility in my price.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and the strategy will adapt based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a guaranteed outcome, but I believe I can do better. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and allows me to control the negotiation process. 

I will counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that balances my desire for a higher profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my commitment to working with you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer is a $25,000 decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise to close the deal.
* **Seeking a middle ground:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a mutually acceptable price, suggesting a collaborative approach.

**Reasoning:**

I'm still confident in the product's value, but I'm also aware of the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer. This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  $825,000 is approaching my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **Room for one more round:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price with one more counteroffer.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away completely.  I'll need to strike a balance between securing a good price and closing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm stressing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using positive language (""close the deal"") to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Reasoning:**

With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal. While $850,000 is lower than my initial goal, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer or having to settle for John's $800,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 6, and Bob is refusing to budge much further. 
* **Risk of losing more:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, I risk further delays and potentially losing him as a buyer altogether.
* **John's offer is a safe option:** Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of a drawn-out negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, the chances of securing a price closer to my initial goal are dwindling. It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will continue to make small offers, making it a drawn-out process with no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures a quick and reliable sale, even if it's slightly below my desired price."
