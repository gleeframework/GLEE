"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and the potential benefits it brings to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment.
