It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. You have a lot of room to go lower before reaching your maximum price of $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and gives me room to compromise in the next rounds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still determined to get a better price than her previous offer. This approach hopefully leads to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now at $825,000, which is close to my target price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to John at $1,500,000 is too high. It's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
