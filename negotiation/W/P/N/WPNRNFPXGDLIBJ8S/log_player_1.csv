Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,000 is a good price and meets my minimum requirement. I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
