"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
