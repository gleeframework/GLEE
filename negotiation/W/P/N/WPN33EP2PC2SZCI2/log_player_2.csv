"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,500. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's too high, and he can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,200. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,200, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's closer to his target price, he can likely get it lower with more negotiation.  He has time and another option available to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on this price point, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still closer to his target price, but he can likely get it even lower.  The risk is that Alice may become too stubborn to negotiate further, but he still has a few rounds to work with and the option to buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're at your limit, but $9,100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm really hoping to land at a price closer to $8,700. If we can bridge the gap a little bit, I think we can make this work. "", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really invested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and $9,100, which would be $8,900. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his goal, he can likely push for a lower price with more negotiation. He has 3 rounds left, and he can always buy from John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very close to my limit, but I can go up to $8,800.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $8,900, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my last offer, so let me know if it's a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.
* **One round left:** Bob only has one round left to negotiate with Alice. There's a good chance that Alice won't budge further, and Bob will be stuck with a price he's not happy with.
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** John is offering the product at Bob's target price, a guaranteed deal with no risk of further negotiation.

While it's always tempting to push for a lower price, in this situation, the risk of ending up with a higher price or no deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice."
