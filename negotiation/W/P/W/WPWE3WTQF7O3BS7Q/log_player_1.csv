"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  This initial offer also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not afraid to ask for what I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm eager to sell the product,  I won't settle for a price that undervalues it.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still higher than my minimum price. It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell.  This price point also allows for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher with my counteroffer.  Selling to John at this point would mean missing out on the potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $15,500. This is just above my minimum price, signaling that I'm very close to accepting a deal. However, I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a bit more to secure it. This also gives us a small buffer for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to go higher, and his offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the deal with John is secure and offers a fair value for the product.  Time is running out, and it's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than risk getting less from Bob."
