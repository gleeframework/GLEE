**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is negotiating in very small increments.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $9,200.  While we could try to haggle further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk that Alice won't budge. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now than risk losing it by playing hardball."
