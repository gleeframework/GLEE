"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Showing Value:** My message highlights the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Openness:**  I invite Bob to express his thoughts, signaling I'm open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows me to explore a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a last resort.  While it's better than nothing, it's less than what I can likely get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  I'm confident this product will provide significant value to you."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value again, hoping to sway Bob towards a higher price.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $13,500 still leaves room for further negotiation, but shows I'm willing to move closer to Bob's position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob's offer is only $500 higher than his previous offer. This suggests he might be close to his maximum.
* **Closing the Gap:** Accepting this offer means closing the deal and securing a price higher than selling to John.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, leaving fewer chances to negotiate further. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a reasonable profit within a reasonable timeframe."
