"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting close!  I can go down to $15,500, but I can't go any lower than that.  I think that's a very fair offer for a product of this quality.",15500.0,Alice,5,
