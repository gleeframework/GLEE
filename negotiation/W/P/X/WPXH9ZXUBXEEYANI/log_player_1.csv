Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you a chance to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than the product's worth to him. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  $10,500 is still below my desired price point. It's worth pushing for a slightly higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round. There's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's a step up from his $10,500 offer, but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Reasonable for both sides:**  $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below the product's worth to him, and it's closer to my desired price point. 
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message emphasizes willingness to compromise and find a fair solution."
