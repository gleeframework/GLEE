"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
