"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair balance given the potential benefits you'll reap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price given the potential benefits. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
