Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. While Bob might not agree to $1,600,000, it sets a reference point that makes your eventual goal (above $1,200,000) seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** It's important to price the product in a way that still incentivizes Bob to negotiate while keeping in mind you have a guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is valuable, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Is there any wiggle room in your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and its actual value to him. This indicates he's aiming for a very aggressive deal. While you want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's time to counter and see if he's willing to move closer to a realistic price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  Dropping from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000 is a substantial move that shows willingness to negotiate. However, it's not a drastic drop to your absolute minimum, allowing for further back and forth. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, you reinforce why your price is justified, subtly countering Bob's attempt to lowball.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still significantly above Bob's offer, signaling you're not desperate to close the deal at any cost. This keeps the door open for him to raise his offer considerably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate for slightly more, it's unlikely he'll go much higher, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees you achieve your goal of selling the product for no less than $1,200,000."
