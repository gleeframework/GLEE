"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is valuable, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
