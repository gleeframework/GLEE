"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives us both a fair deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,900?  That's only $100 more than your offer and would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. Would you be willing to consider $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and go with $8,850? This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",8850.0,Alice,7,
