Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $8,500 is too low, and I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,000 and I think we can get there with a little more negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $8,900?  That's only $100 more than your offer and would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,700, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $9,000. I think we can still get there with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 7

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price.  $8,750 is still a good deal for me, especially considering the time I've spent negotiating with Bob."
