,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price. This offer is still very advantageous for you, considering the product's potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $900,000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still looking for a better price.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This offer reflects a compromise on both our ends and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $881,250. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",881250.0,Bob,6,
