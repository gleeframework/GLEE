"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $90 is under your $100 budget, you know John will sell it for $100. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a subsequent offer to secure the sale."
