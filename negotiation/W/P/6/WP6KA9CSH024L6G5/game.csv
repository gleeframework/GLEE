"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to pay that, I'm willing to make a deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
