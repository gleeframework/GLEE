"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. It's time to move on and buy the product from John for $100."
