"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it, as that's my maximum price point. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
