"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,7,
