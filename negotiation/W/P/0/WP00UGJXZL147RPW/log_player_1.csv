Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below your maximum ($120) at $119 might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Starting too high (very close to $120) might discourage Bob immediately. This approach aims for a price that seems fair while maximizing potential profit."
