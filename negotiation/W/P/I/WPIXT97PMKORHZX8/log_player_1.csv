{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$80 is below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
