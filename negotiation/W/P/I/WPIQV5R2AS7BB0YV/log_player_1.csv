Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at $120 and it's unlikely he'll go much higher. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $150."
