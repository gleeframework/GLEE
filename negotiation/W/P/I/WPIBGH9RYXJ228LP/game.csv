"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,300,000 is a bit out of my range.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value you place on the product, $1,600,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value we both bring to the table.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go to $1,850,000. This is a good compromise, and I hope we can close the deal on this number.  It's important to me that we find a solution that works for both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
