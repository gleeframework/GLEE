Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value you place on the product, $1,600,000 is significantly below my bottom line. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,000,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still higher than his target price. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice closer to his budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value we both bring to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better deal. He's already made a counteroffer at $1,800,000, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further. There are still a few rounds left, so it's not time to give up."
