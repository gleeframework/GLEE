While $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob can get the product for less from John, so he should reject Alice's offer and counteroffer again."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:

While $16,250 is tempting, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  John is offering the product for $15,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best price he has seen so far. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
