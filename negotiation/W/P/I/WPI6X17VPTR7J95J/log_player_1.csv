Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are relatively small. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to my minimum in a reasonable number of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
