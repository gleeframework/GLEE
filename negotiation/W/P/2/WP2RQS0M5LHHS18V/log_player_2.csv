"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity given its value to you and our commitment to fair pricing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, we signal our willingness to negotiate while leaving room for movement. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $8,500 is still above Alice's perceived value of $8,000, giving her a potential profit margin while being a significant saving from her initial offer and our alternative of buying from John.
* **Polite and Open:** The message maintains a polite and open tone, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer at $9,000. This price reflects a balance between the value you see in the product and our business interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has come down in price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($9,000) and both her value ($8,000) and our alternative ($12,000). 
* **Risk:** While we risk Alice walking away, another counteroffer allows us to push for a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to her price.
* **Pressure:** The offer still keeps the pressure on Alice. It's a significant saving for us and provides her a reasonable profit over her value.
* **Time:** As the negotiation continues, the option of buying from John for $12,000 becomes more appealing. We need to move towards a close or consider that alternative."
