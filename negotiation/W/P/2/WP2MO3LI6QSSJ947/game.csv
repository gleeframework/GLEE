"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering the value to me and your desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $12,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Alice,5,
