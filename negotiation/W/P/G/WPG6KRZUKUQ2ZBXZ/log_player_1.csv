Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a steal at $95. I know you'll find great use out of it!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 creates a sense of urgency (a ""steal"") while still leaving room for a profit above my minimum. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value of $80, especially if he thinks it's a good deal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
