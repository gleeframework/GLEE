"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $14,000.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and likely appealing to Alice, who values the product at $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,800, which is only $800 more than Bob's counteroffer of $13,000.  It's a good compromise and a better price than what John is offering.  There's no guarantee that a further counteroffer will lead to a lower price, and the risk of Alice rejecting and then making a higher counteroffer is too high.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
