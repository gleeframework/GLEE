"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice has come down, it's still above your target.  Keep negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still too high.  I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for reaching a deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $780,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best deal you can get from Alice.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll walk away.  You can also buy the product from John for the same price, but accepting this offer ensures the deal is closed."
