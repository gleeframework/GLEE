"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can potentially get it for cheaper. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate and you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd like to offer $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate further while also showing Alice you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $110 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a reasonable price for the product. You've already successfully negotiated a lower price. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up with no deal, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget."
