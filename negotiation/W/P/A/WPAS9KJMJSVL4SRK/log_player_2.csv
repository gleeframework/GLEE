"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, and I know you value it highly as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
