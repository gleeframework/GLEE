Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than $150 to entice him.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than his valuation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
