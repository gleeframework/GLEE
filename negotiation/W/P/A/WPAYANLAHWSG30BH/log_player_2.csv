"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
