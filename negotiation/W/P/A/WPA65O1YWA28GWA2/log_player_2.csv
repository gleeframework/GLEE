"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and it's likely further negotiation will only yield a price closer to John's, not lower. It's better to secure the product for a guaranteed price now."
