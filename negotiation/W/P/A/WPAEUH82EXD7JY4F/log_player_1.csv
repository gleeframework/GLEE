Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially gain an extra $5,000.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price too steep. Even if he negotiates down, you might still secure a price higher than $15,000. 
* **Understand the Risk:**  There's a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, with a significant profit margin on the table, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
