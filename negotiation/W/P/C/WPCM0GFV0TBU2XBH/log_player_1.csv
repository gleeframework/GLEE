Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it allows for negotiation space. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me the best chance of achieving a high sale price.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This initial offer will reveal if Bob is seriously interested in the product and what his budget might be.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I can gradually lower the price during counteroffers if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I will consider his counteroffer and my options:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I might accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If his counteroffer is significantly lower, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiations are dragging on or Bob's counteroffers are unacceptable, I will sell to John for $800,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good price, but it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating he is willing to pay a higher price than my minimum.
* **Missed profit opportunity:** While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can secure a higher price with additional negotiations.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and demonstrate that I am not desperate for a quick sale.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still lower than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not to give in to his demands completely. I will assess his response and continue negotiating until I reach an acceptable price or decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,150,000. This represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This price allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he's willing to come up a bit more.
* **Maintaining momentum:** A reasonable counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and prevents the deal from stalling.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer:

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I will finalize the sale.
* **Rejection and counteroffer:** If Bob rejects but offers a price closer to $1,150,000, I may accept or counteroffer again.
* **Rejection and unreasonable counteroffer:** If Bob rejects and offers a price significantly lower, I may counteroffer again or choose to sell to John if it's not worth continuing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is slightly lower than my desired price, it is still a significant profit margin. Considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob withdrawing completely, accepting his offer is the most sensible option.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob becoming unwilling to continue or lowering his offer even further.
* **Achieving a good profit:** $1,050,000 represents a substantial profit and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting the offer allows me to secure the sale quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will finalize the sale with Bob at the agreed-upon price of $1,050,000."
