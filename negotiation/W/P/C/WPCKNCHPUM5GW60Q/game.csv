"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a little rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're making progress!  I understand your financial constraints.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1112500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, so how about we make it happen right now for $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I think we can close this deal now. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to secure a fair deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
