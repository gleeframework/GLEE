I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the negotiations are taking too long and I'm worried we might not reach an agreement within the 10 rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting a lower price from Bob or running out of time."
