"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! Your product seems great, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's worth to her.  This leaves room for further negotiation while also showing Bob is serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but it's getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as there's still room for both of us to find a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, but still below it. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also emphasizes I'm trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is now within my budget and represents a good compromise. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or me reaching my limit of 10 rounds is increasing. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a good price without risking further delays or having to buy from John at a higher price."
