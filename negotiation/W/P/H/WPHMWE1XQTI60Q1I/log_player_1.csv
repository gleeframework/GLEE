"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true potential and benefits."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This serves two purposes:
    * **Gauging Bob's eagerness:**  A quick acceptance means he might have valued it even higher.
    * **Room for negotiation:**  It allows for concessions throughout the rounds, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

* **Confident Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm framing it as reflecting the product's ""true potential,"" subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind. 
 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage and allows me to confidently walk away from deals that don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial ask, but it's still above both his perceived value and my minimum. This indicates room for further negotiation. I'm willing to reject this offer and counter in Round 3 to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price, but I'm doing it in smaller increments.  This maintains a sense of the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:**  By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around $1,900,000.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  I'm still significantly above Bob's perceived value and my own minimum, giving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, but his latest offer is getting uncomfortably close to my absolute minimum. While I could potentially secure a deal above my minimum, the margin for error is shrinking.  I'll reject and counter, aiming for around $1,800,000. If Bob isn't willing to move significantly in the next round, selling to John becomes a serious consideration."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, and I'm willing to make this work. How about $1,825,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Strategic Compromise:** The price is a significant concession on my part, coming down by $75,000 from my previous offer. It shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal but not at the expense of a substantial loss.
* **Above Minimum, Respecting Value:**  This offer keeps me comfortably above my $1,500,000 minimum while still offering Bob a price significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Preparing for Alternative:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it strongly suggests he's not willing to meet my price expectations. I'll likely sell to John at that point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,825,000 and $1,700,000, which would be $1,762,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,762,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":** Bob has also declared his ""final offer."" This tactic suggests he's unlikely to move significantly from his $1,762,500 price. 
* **Too Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is above my $1,500,000 minimum, it leaves a very small margin. Continuing negotiations with him at this point carries a significant risk of ending up with a less favorable deal than what John is offering.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:** John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum. It eliminates the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome by continuing with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

It's been a tough negotiation with Bob, but sometimes the best deals are the ones you don't make.  Selling to John guarantees a fair price and allows me to move forward with certainty."
