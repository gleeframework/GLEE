"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and I still get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12500 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13250? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while staying within your budget.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $13250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12750. This would be a fair price, and would allow us to both reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement.  While $12750 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference â€“  I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,5,
