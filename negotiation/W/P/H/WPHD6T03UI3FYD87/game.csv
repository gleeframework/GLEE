"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a great product, but I've done my research and I think it's worth less than what you're asking. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd love to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you've done your research and have a clear idea of the product's value to you. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $850000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to make a new offer of $775000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to make a new offer of $810000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a final push to get it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $810000. I'm willing to make one final concession, so I'm counteroffering at $825000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5% discount on the total price, which would bring the price down to $783750. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",783750.0,Alice,7,
