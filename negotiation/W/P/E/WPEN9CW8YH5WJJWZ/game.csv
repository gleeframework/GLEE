"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer before I start to get a bit nervous about the deal falling through.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I've heard your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable selling the product at this price. I'm willing to make one final push, but I need to get a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
