Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm able to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.
