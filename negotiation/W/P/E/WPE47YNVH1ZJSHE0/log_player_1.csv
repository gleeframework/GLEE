Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still staying within a profitable range for you.
* **Confidence and Value:** The language emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as a special opportunity. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
