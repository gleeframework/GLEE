It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can try to get a lower price, and even if Alice rejects it, you can still buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but if she rejects, I can always fall back to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is now $11,000, which is still within my budget.  It's only $1,000 more than John's offer, so it's worth accepting to avoid the potential hassle of further negotiation."
