Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, or he might reject it outright. You have a strong backup option with John, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
