"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a chance to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,500, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
