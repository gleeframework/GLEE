Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. I have a fallback option, which gives me confidence during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a strong backup option with John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a chance to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm aiming for a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and how the price remains a good deal for Bob.
* **Strategic Message:** I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,500, and I think that's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a prolonged process without a significant increase.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Bob rejecting another counteroffer and wasting more time is high.
* **Secure Profit:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

Given the situation, selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction, minimizing potential delays and uncertainties."
