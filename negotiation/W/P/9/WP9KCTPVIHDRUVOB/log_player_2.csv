(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to my maximum budget of $1,200,000. This demonstrates my seriousness in negotiating but leaves room for compromise.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will set the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since I can always purchase from John for $1,200,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is still within my budget and could be a good middle ground for Alice. I'm hoping Alice will accept, but if not, I have a fallback option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of reaching a stalemate and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product while still saving a substantial amount."
