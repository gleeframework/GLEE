"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110, which is a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $110 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I think I can do better than $107.50. How about we meet at $112? It's still a great value, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you.",112.0,Alice,5,
