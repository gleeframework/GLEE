Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate a price higher than your minimum ($8,000) but lower than his maximum.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $12,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still being an attractive offer for Bob, saving him $3,000. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning you'll list the product publicly (or that you have other buyers) subtly implies Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer.

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's beneficial for both parties."
