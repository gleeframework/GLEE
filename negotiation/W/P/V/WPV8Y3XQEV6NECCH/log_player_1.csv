{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to potentially negotiate down.  However, it's still within a reasonable range for him to consider. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and counter-offer accordingly. I'm also leaving the door open to potentially sell to John if the negotiations don't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counter-offer that hopefully closes the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my target by sending another counter-offer. I'm also mindful that John is still an option if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're still very interested in the product. I'm also very interested in finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference on our last offers, and I'll do $8,000?  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'm prepared to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
