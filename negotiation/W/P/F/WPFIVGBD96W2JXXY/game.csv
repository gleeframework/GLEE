"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down on the price a bit?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $110 for the product?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, would $97.50 work for you?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. That way, I can still make a decent profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're finding some common ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $100 even?  That seems like a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. But I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $107.50? That's as low as I can go.",107.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I'm running out of time and I need to make a decision soon.  My absolute final offer is $95. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John.",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running out of time, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $98, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John.",98.0,Alice,9,
