Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
