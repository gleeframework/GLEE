Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I've analyzed its value extensively, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting above Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your analysis, you're subtly anchoring the price to a point of perceived value.

**Outcome**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts your offer of $1,350,000.
* **Alternative:** If Bob negotiates or rejects, you can still counter-offer or proceed with John, guaranteeing your minimum price.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance."
