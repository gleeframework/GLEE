"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price,  $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $10,000? ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but that's still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
