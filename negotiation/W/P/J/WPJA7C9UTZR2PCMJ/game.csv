"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the  true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this strikes a more balanced approach.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
