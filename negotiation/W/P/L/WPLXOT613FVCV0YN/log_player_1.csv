Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product without going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $1,000,000 elsewhere. I'll accept his offer and move on."
