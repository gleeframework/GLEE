Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still lower than the product's value to Bob, but gives me a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100,000 difference provides wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer, while still ensuring I'm making a significant profit.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the deal for Bob, not just for me. This can encourage him to consider accepting.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a profitable deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my desired price, I might accept. If not, I'll counter again, aiming to inch closer to my desired price.
*  I'll keep in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can still potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, which is still a significant profit.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price between his offer of $1,100,000 and my initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,250,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his next counteroffer. I might need to lower my price further, but I'll try to maintain a profitable margin.
* I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still not a profitable deal for me.  I'm aiming for at least $1,200,000 to make a significant profit.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our prices.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price between his offer of $1,175,000 and my previous offer of $1,250,000. 
* I'll continue to carefully assess Bob's position and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan in case the negotiations with Bob stall."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,200,000.  This price is fair considering the value you'll receive, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $1,175,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I'm making a good profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the deal for both of us, emphasizing that it's a ""win-win scenario."" 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options. If he comes back with a significantly lower offer, I might need to accept his offer to avoid losing the deal. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a fallback option if negotiations fail."
