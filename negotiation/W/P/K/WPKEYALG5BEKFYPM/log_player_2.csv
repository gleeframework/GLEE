Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer at $13,000. It's my best offer so far, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further back-and-forth."
