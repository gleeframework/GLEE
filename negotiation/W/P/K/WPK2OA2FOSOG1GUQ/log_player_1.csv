{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I know you'll find highly beneficial. My initial price is $900,000. I believe this represents a fair value considering the product's worth to you.  Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum. I need to continue negotiating to secure a price closer to the product's value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep working towards a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $850,000. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price John is offering.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get the best possible price."
