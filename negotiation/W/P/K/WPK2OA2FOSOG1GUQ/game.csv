"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I know you'll find highly beneficial. My initial price is $900,000. I believe this represents a fair value considering the product's worth to you.  Let's discuss further!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a starting point.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep working towards a successful deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not quite there with $850,000. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
