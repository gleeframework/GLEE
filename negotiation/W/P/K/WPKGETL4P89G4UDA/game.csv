"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $10500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500, so I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9750 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10200. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
