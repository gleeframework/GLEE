"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Considering its potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer for $1,400,000 saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Although the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, that's irrelevant to Bob's decision. He's focused on the best price for himself."
