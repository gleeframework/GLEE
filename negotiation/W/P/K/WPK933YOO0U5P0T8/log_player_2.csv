Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. It's now at $82, which is only $2 more than your maximum budget.  While you could try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and you risk running out of rounds before you can buy from John.  It's a good deal, and you should take it."
