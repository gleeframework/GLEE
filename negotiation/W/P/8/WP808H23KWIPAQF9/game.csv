"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but only at a much lower price point. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges its value while still being a good deal for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,900,000 is closer to where I'd need to be, it's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
