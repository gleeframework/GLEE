{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable value:**  You still have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This allows for a straightforward response from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the negotiation open for a possible win-win scenario."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I want for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

While $7,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
