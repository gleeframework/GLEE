"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However,  $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",15000.0,Bob,6,
