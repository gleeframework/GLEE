Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer. But it establishes a starting point for negotiation and sets a clear expectation that the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that reflects the product's worth to me.  $95 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still seeking a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not result in a better deal.  Selling to John for $100 ensures I reach my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
