{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my financial goals.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do in this situation."
