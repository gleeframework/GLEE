"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  While I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'm going to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  It's likely he'll counteroffer, and we'll then have a chance to negotiate.  If he doesn't counter, I've secured a great price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There's still room to maneuver, and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product, and if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum value, so I'll accept.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the deal.  It's a good outcome, and I've secured a solid price."
