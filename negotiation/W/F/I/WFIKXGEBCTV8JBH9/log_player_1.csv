Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation moving. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This offer allows you to potentially earn more than your minimum of $1,500,000 if Bob counteroffers and you can negotiate a higher price.

Remember, it's important to be confident and persuasive when presenting your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to hold firm on my position and see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'd like to stick with my previous offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $1,000,000 offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation that could ultimately yield a lower price. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
