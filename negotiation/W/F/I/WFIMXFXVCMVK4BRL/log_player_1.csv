"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is around $800,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room for negotiation. Let's counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident about the true value this product holds. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a middle ground."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm proposing $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close to John's offer, but there's still room for Bob to move. We need to hold firm and signal that we have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. However, I have other interested parties, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept. I can go down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other interested parties, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'm proposing $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to go higher, and we're still well above John's offer. Accepting secures a good profit."
