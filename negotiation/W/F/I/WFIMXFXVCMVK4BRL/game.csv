"Bob, I believe this product is a game-changer and incredibly valuable. I'm initially offering it to you at a premium price of $1,500,000, reflecting its potential worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is around $800,000. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident about the true value this product holds. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'm proposing $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. However, I have other interested parties, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept. I can go down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other interested parties, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'm proposing $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
