"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $25000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm comfortable offering $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $20000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $20000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me closer to the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $16000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
