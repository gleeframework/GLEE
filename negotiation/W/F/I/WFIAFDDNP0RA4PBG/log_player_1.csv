"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I believe I can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm also confident that I can get a better deal than John's offer of $8,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and guarantees a profit.  I'm also mindful that I have limited rounds, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent choice in this situation."
