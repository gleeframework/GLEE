Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price significantly lower than what John is offering. Accepting his current offer would mean a $100,000 loss compared to John's deal. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
