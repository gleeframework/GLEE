I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $1500000 to you. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000), you're saving $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save as much money as possible."
