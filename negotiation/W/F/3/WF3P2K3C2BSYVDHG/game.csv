"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $8,000? I believe that's a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,000?  I believe that represents a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
