"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is offering the product at your maximum price point, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice. You're guaranteed to get the product for the same price from John, eliminating any risk of a drawn-out negotiation or potentially higher price."
