I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a significant enough price to gauge his interest. 

If he rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If his counteroffer is significantly lower, I might counter with a price closer to $1,250,000. However, if he's willing to pay a price closer to my initial offer, I'll try to push for a final price closer to $1,400,000. 

Remember, I have John as a backup option, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me a strong negotiating position."
