"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate.  It also expresses interest in a deal with Bob and opens the door for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I need to push for a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500?  That gives us both some room to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $9,000, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and John is offering me a much better deal. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go to $9,250.  This is a fair price that's closer to my value and still within your range. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $9,000 was a bit of a stretch, but I can do $8,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still far below what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further.  John's offer is still on the table, so I can always go that route if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to $9,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $8,900. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,750, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's a better outcome for me than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
