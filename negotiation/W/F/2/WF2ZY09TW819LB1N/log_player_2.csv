"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  You have room to negotiate, and there's no guarantee you'll get the product for $120 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get the price down to around $80, which would save me a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get the price down further.  $90 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm not ready to commit yet.  I'll see if I can get Alice to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm still below her offer of $90, and I'm hoping she'll meet me in the middle."
