Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, $85 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not able to go lower than $95.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go below $95. It's better to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price of $80."
