"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're bringing, $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, but it's still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for further negotiation without immediately risking a deal breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  It's a win-win! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He has 7 rounds left and should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable with my previous offer of $12,000.  If we can't find common ground here, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer,  emphasizing his budget constraints and the potential for exploring other options. This tactic keeps the pressure on Alice and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
