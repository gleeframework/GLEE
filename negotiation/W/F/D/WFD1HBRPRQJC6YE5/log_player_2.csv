{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $985,000 is very close to my preferred price range.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, I'm concerned that doing so risks losing the deal entirely.  Considering the limited time remaining and the potential for a breakdown in negotiations, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action.  It allows me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
