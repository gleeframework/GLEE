"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer you a price of $1,020,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your flexibility,  $1,020,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,020,000 and $950,000. I'll offer you a price of $990,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very close to my budget limit, and I can only go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'll offer you a price of $985,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement, so I want to make one final offer.",985000.0,Alice,9,
