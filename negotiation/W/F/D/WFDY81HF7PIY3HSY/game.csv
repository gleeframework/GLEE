"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both the product's worth and your budget.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit stretched with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  $775000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's split the difference and go with $825000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both the product's worth and your budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
