Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed $1,000,000 sale to John, but it gives Bob an opportunity to potentially acquire the product at a price that might be valuable to him.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I'm aiming for a higher profit by offering a price above my minimum. 
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm willing to take the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, as I have a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By offering a higher price first, I create a starting point for potential negotiation, should Bob be interested in the product but not at the full price. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
