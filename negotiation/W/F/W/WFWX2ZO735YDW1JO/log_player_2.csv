"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **You have a better alternative:** You know John will sell you the product for $10,000. 
* **Maximizing savings:** Your goal is to save money, and buying from John saves you $1,000 compared to Alice's offer. 

While Alice's offer isn't bad, you can do better by going with John."
