"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $775,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $775,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm still open to discussing further. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $800,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,6,
