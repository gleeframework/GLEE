"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  $1000000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product given its unique value.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is still a great price considering its potential benefits, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
