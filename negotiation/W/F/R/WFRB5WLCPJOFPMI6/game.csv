"I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $10,500 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  Could you do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're motivated to sell, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $10,000. Can we make a deal at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
