Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,500,000 backup, Alice can aim high with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves space for potential counter-offers.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while being aware that Bob has the option to refuse, leading Alice to the guaranteed sale to John."
