Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable addition, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without going below our own minimum of $15,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some back and forth. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle above our minimum. 
* **Secure a deal:** While we have John as a backup, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Closing a deal quickly avoids potential delays or complications with John."
