"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $800,000, which is its true worth. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be valuable to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can go up to $925,000, but I'm really pushing my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I still need to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $975,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, as I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I've compromised a lot, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $975,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $987,500. This is my final offer.",987500.0,Alice,9,
