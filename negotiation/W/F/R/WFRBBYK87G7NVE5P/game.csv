"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me, would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000, the minimum I'm willing to sell it for?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I think the product is good, $12,000 is just too much for my budget.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000, which would be $11,000. This is the best I can do.",11000.0,Alice,5,
