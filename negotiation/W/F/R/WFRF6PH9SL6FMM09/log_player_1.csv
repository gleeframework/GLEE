Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it provides. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential."" This subtly anchors the product's worth in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""I'm initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. If Bob accepts the $15,000, that's fantastic.
* If Bob counters, Alice has the option to negotiate down towards $12,000 knowing she has a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* Alice must be prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob if he's not willing to meet her minimum acceptable price."
