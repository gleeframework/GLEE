Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This reflects the product's inherent worth while still acknowledging your interest.

$1,000,000 is still too high, but it's a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate. Let's try a counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
