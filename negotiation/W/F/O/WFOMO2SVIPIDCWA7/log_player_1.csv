Round 2
Bob's offer:

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
