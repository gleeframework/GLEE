"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to:

* **Signal strong interest in a deal:** We don't want to lowball on the first counteroffer and risk turning Alice off.
* **Establish a negotiation range:**  By starting significantly lower, we create room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us.
* **Keep the $150 alternative in mind:**  While we want to save money, we also need to remember we have a viable backup option if this negotiation stalls."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer! While $135 is better, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $122.50?"",
""product_price"": 122.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Specific number:** Using a specific, uneven number like $122.50 can make the offer seem more considered and less like a simple round number. 
* **Still below our limit:**  We're keeping our offer well below our $150 walk-away point, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $122.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire, but Alice's concessions are getting smaller. We're only $10 away from our backup plan with John, so it's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal if we can find a number that works for both of us. How about $130, and we can wrap this up?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and decisive:** We're signaling that we're serious about buying and want to finalize the deal soon.
* **Strong but fair counter:** $130 is a firm offer but still represents a compromise from our previous offer and a significant discount from Alice's initial price. 
* **Time pressure:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, which might encourage Alice to accept a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price for the product and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal potential savings:**  At this point, we're only $15 away from John's price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap significantly. 
* **Time is running out:** We only have a few rounds left, and there's a chance the negotiation could stall, leaving us to settle for John's price anyway.
* **Good deal overall:**  $135 represents a $40 discount from Alice's initial offer and a decent savings overall.

It's time to accept the deal and secure the product at a reasonable price."
