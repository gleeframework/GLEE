Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $700,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.
