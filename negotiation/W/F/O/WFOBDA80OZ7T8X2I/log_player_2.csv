"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1200000. It's a fair deal for both of us, as it's worth exactly that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is exactly the maximum Bob is willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting the offer.  Rejecting the offer means Bob can then buy the product from John for the same price, but it allows the possibility that Alice might lower her price in order to secure the deal."
