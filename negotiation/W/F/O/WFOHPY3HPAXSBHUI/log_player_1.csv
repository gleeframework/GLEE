"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1700000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he may walk away altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at $1,750,000 than risk ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000."
