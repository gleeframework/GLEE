"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $1,200,000 sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob,  making him consider it seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While it's a high offer, it's still less than my minimum of $1,000,000, allowing for some bargaining. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides me with a guaranteed fallback option, allowing me to take risks during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counter-offer reflects my willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the value reduction I'm offering, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and a willingness to finalize the deal.
* **John's Offer:** This counter-offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway, knowing that I have John's offer as a safety net if Bob is unwilling to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There is still some room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer.  
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,000,000 provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Final Offer:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" might put pressure on me, but it's not binding. I can still make a counteroffer and see if he's truly unwilling to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's final offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to reconsider.
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes that the price is ""fair"" for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  While this offer meets my minimum, I still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. This provides a strong safety net and allows me to be firm with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  While $980,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, there's limited time to further negotiate with Bob.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially resulting in a lower price.
* **Finality:**  Bob's ""final offer"" might indicate he's unlikely to budge further, making the decision to sell to John more logical."
