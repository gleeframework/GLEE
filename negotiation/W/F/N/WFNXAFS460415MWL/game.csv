"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope you can accept it.",980000.0,Bob,6,
