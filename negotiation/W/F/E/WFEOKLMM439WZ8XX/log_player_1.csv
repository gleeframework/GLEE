"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and increase the chances of a deal. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I mention the product's value to entice Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds left. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John.

**Next steps:** 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the $12,000 price as ""fair"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out.

Let's see if Bob is willing to budge!"
