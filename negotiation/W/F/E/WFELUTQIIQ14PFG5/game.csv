"While I appreciate the offer, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't agree on a price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
