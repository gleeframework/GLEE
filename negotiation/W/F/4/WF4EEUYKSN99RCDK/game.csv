"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering its value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would that be workable?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",8250.0,Alice,5,
