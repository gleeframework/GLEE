"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
