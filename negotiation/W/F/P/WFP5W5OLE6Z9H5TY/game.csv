,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me at this time. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $700000 at this stage.  I'm confident this product is a valuable asset and I'm willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of $950000. This is my best and final offer for now.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if it works for you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $850000. However, I still need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a deal for $920000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $920000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $875000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
