Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's budget and his target price. 
* **Limited rounds:**  He only has a few rounds left. There's a risk that if he continues to negotiate with Alice, he might run out of time and still not reach a deal within his budget.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is offering the product for Bob's target price, and there's no uncertainty or further negotiation involved. 

By choosing to buy from John, Bob secures the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
