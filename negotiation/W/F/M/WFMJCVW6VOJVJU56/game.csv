"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desired profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a little out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
