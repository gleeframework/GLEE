"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desired profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a little out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $15,000. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing at this point."
