Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Offering a ""deal"":**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** I'm expecting Bob to counter-offer, but I have a safety net with John's offer. 
* **Setting the stage for further negotiation:**  My message is friendly and open to discussion, which is important for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm looking to save a bit of money, but I'm still very interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).** While it's closer, I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob is clearly interested and has already lowered his price.
* **I have a safety net with John's offer.** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and keep the negotiation going. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** My counter-offer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also moves the price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counter-offer.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:** I'm using positive language and acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, keeping the conversation friendly.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm confident that $11,500 is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $11200. I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000).**  While it's getting closer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating.
* **The potential for further negotiation is limited.** Bob has indicated that he's at his limit, and further counter-offers might lead to a stalemate. 
* **John's offer is significantly higher.**  I have a guaranteed sale at a much better price with John.

Given these factors, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John and avoid further haggling with Bob. This ensures I maximize my profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
