"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **John's offer:**  $15,000 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better deal from Alice. If Alice doesn't budge, Bob still has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is too high.
* **John's offer:**  $15,000 is still a backup option.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob offers $12,500, which is closer to Alice's minimum value ($12,000) and still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while aiming for a substantial discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a significant discount from the initial offer.
* **John's offer:**  $15,000 is still available, but Alice's current offer is better.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject and the negotiations will drag on.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal within the limited rounds. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of running out of rounds and having to buy at a higher price from John."
