Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and expressing confidence in the product's value aims to influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Clear Call to Action:**  I directly ask for Bob's decision to encourage a response and keep the negotiation moving.

**Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
