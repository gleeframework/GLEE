"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm using a message that emphasizes the value of the product and subtly suggests the price is fair. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **More negotiation rounds:** I still have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is not yet the best option:**  While I can secure $1,000,000 by selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find this price very competitive. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price but not by a huge margin. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum target of $1,000,000.
* **Positive and Motivational Message:** I'm staying optimistic and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to make a deal.
* **Highlighting the Discount:**  By framing the new price as a discount, I'm making it seem more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far off. I can do $700,000.  It's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum target of $1,000,000.
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is not yet the best option:** While I can secure $1,000,000 by selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll come down to $850,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Framing it as a win-win:**  I'm emphasizing that splitting the difference is beneficial for both of us, making the offer more attractive.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** I'm suggesting that we find common ground, implying that time is running out and we need to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** $780,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Only 4 rounds left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option. However, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's already indicated a willingness to increase his offer. 

I'll try to find a way to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $780,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal quickly. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only lowering my price by $30,000, showing I'm still committed to getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" which can be more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing closing the deal quickly to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** This counteroffer still allows me to sell to John if the negotiations don't work out in the next few rounds."
