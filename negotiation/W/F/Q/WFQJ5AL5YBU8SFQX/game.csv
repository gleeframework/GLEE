"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident you'll find this price very competitive. Let's make this deal happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a bit far off. I can do $700,000.  It's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll come down to $850,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $780,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal quickly. Let's make this happen!",820000.0,Alice,7,
