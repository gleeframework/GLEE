"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 140. How about we meet in the middle at 160? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 150 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 150 and my original price of 180. How about we try 165? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",165.0,Alice,5,
