{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, but still gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's above your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to negotiate if needed. 
* **It shows flexibility:** The message shows you are open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.

This is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,500 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John is willing to pay your desired price. 
* **Negotiation room:** You still have room to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

You can counter Bob's offer with a price closer to your desired price point. Consider a counteroffer around $13,500 or $14,000 to see if you can find a compromise.  If Bob rejects your counteroffer, then you should consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500.
* **Still above minimum:** $13,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By sticking to a price above Bob's offer, you maintain leverage in the negotiation and demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your own value.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still holding onto your desired price point. Keep an eye on Bob's response and be prepared to adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original counteroffer of $12,500.  If you're not able to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for compromise:** Bob has stuck to his original counteroffer, and further negotiation is unlikely to get you closer to your desired price.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you get the value you desire.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks delaying the sale and could lead to a lower price ultimately. 

**It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid potentially wasting more time with Bob.**"
