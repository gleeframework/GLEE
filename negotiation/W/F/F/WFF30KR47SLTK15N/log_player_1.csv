"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This is a high initial offer,  aiming to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, but it's a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll reject it and counteroffer to explore if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value,  but it's getting closer. I'll reject it and counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,550,000,  which is just above my minimum value. This is a significant concession, showing Bob that I am serious about selling, but still leaves room for some potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear we're not going to reach an agreement, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the safest and most profitable option."
