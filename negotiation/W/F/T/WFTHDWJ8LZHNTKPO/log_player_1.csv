Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone in the message can make Bob more likely to engage and consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to make it seem more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is acceptable to both of us while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm rejecting his offer for now because:

* **Room for Negotiation:** I still believe there's room for a higher price. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target, but not too far from Bob's offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Avoid Settling:** I don't want to settle for the $85 price just yet. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can observe if Bob is willing to raise his offer. 

I'm confident that I can find a better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. How does that sound? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Bob's:** My counteroffer is only $10 higher than Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Reiterate Willingness to Deal:**  The message emphasizes my desire to reach a deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to me and potentially enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer.  If I reject, I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Limited Time:** It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $120. However, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and move on to other opportunities.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer at $90 is the most sensible decision. It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale without jeopardizing a potentially higher offer from another buyer."
