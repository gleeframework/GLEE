"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
