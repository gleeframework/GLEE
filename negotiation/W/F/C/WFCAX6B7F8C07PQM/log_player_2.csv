"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget, though. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It also gives us room to gradually increase our offer if needed while still aiming for a final price well below $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation on both sides. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is now closer to a reasonable price, it's still above what John is offering. I'll reject and counter-offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle between her current offer and my last one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer aims for a price that is beneficial for both parties. It's lower than Alice's current offer but significantly higher than our previous one, showing willingness to compromise while still striving for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her current offer is above John's price. It makes more financial sense to secure the product from John at the guaranteed $8,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
