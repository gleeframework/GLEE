"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than $950,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true worth of the product while still providing you with a significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
