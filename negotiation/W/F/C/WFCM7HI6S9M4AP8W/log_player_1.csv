{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging Bob's potential interest while setting a price higher than his perceived value. It aims to start the negotiation and gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $130 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. I was thinking more along the lines of $132. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $132 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and a quicker sale than going back and forth with Bob again. I'm confident that I can still make a good profit on this deal."
