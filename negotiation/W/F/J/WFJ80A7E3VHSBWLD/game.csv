"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value and represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $2,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
