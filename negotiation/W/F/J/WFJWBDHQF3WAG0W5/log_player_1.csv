"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point given Bob values the product at $12,000.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway, or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial target of $11,500. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my desired value. If he rejects this, I'll consider lowering my price even further, but only if I'm convinced he's genuinely interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm getting closer to my floor, I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round.  I'm also not particularly concerned about selling to John at this point, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,800.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,600. While it's not my ideal price, I'm running out of time. With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to squeeze out more from Bob.  This offer is above my minimum, and I'm comfortable closing the deal at this price."
