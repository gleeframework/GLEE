"Alice, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $700000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This still reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential for you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
