"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would you consider that price?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can get elsewhere. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground here.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I can do $9,500. That's a fair offer considering my maximum budget."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is still quite far from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to John's $10,000 offer within the remaining rounds. To maximize savings and avoid the risk of Alice not going any lower, it's best to cut the negotiation short and buy from John."
