"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about $900,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering its value, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but my budget constraints are quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $875,000. This is a significant step towards your desired price while still being within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
