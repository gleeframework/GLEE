"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it's insulting or immediately shuts down negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to lay the groundwork for a high price.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer leaves ample room for me to lower the price during subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer. This empowers me to be firmer in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is far above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's showing some willingness to negotiate, accepting $850,000 would be a substantial loss. I'll provide a counteroffer that brings the price closer to my target range while still encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product.  However, $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects my desire to find a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's offer and closer to my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's inherent value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  By using the phrase ""fair deal,"" I'm subtly suggesting that Bob's offer is not yet in that territory, encouraging him to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer! Bob increased his offer to $950,000, but this is still below my $1,000,000 minimum.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if I can't get a price that meets my needs.  I will make one more counter offer close to my minimum and hope that Bob is willing to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I've considered your latest offer carefully, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to convey a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Slight Concession:** While above my minimum, coming down to $1,050,000 shows I'm trying to meet Bob somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Option (John):**  By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm reminding Bob that I have a viable alternative if he doesn't accept this offer.
* **Pressure to Close:**  This strategy aims to encourage Bob to make a decision now, rather than prolonging negotiations further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1,050,000 is simply out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant amount for me. This is my final offer,  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to move:** Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" and it's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss compared to John's deal. 
* **Time value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob has an opportunity cost.  Closing the deal with John now allows me to move on to other ventures. 

**While I could try to squeeze a bit more from Bob, the risk of losing both offers and ending up with nothing isn't worth the potential reward.**"
