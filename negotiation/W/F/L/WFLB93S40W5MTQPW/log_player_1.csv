Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  It also shows you are confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll try to get closer to my goal by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and still a great price for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
