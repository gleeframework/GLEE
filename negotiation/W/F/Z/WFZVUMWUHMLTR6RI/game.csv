"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a little too high for my budget.  Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  $900,000 is still far below its true worth.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the product's immense value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has a lot of value, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Her final offer is still quite a bit more than I can do.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us.  To meet you closer to your budget, I can come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to this deal is evident.  I'm ready to compromise to finalize this today. Let's agree on $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between our positions.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
