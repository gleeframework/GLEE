Alice's offer:

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has repeatedly stated her bottom line, and it's still significantly higher than your budget and John's offer.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** You have a guaranteed offer for $800,000.  There's no need to risk Alice rejecting further offers and potentially losing the product altogether.

While you could try for one more counteroffer, it's highly probable you won't get close to the $800,000 mark with Alice. Secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of overpaying."
