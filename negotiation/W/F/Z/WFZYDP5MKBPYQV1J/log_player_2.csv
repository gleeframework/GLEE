"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so I'm not sure it's worth $119 to me. I can get it from John for $120, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy it from John.
