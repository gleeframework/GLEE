"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7500? ",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8500? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8200.  If you're willing to come down just a little bit, I'm ready to close the deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $8200. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8800. I'm trying to make a profit here, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8800.0,Alice,5,
