"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  There's clearly value in this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $17,000.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
