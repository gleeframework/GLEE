"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to establish a bargaining space.
* **Emphasize Value:** I mention the product's worth to me, implying its quality and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I express willingness to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $175 provides some room for Bob to counter without me feeling pressured to immediately accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth exploring further. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room to negotiate further.  I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and hopefully leads to a more favorable outcome.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as an option keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a deal I'm not fully comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me at this time.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop the price to $160, which is still a good deal considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still upholding my minimum price point.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I frame the offer as ""meeting in the middle,"" implying a fair solution. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth to highlight the potential benefits.
* **Leaving Room for More Negotiation:**  $160 allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without making me feel like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Gain:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. 
* **Equal Value:** Selling to Bob at $150 is equivalent to selling to John. 
* **Time Savings:**  Accepting the offer saves time and potential further rounds of negotiation."
