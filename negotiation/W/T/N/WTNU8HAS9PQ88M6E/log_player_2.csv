"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high. You can save a lot of money by negotiating further. 
* Buying from John would cost you significantly more. 
* It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value. 
* This is a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary.
* It also leaves room for negotiation and compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $750,000 is a good compromise. 
* It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further offers, and I might end up paying more by buying from John. 
* Accepting this offer secures a good deal with less risk."
