Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, it leaves you space to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:** Ending with an invitation to discuss further encourages Bob to engage in negotiation, even if his initial reaction is hesitant."
