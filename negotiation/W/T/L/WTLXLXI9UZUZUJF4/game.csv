"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the compromise, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $10500. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $10800. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings and the time and effort I've put into it. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll go up to $10200. I think that's a fair price, considering the value the product brings and my budget.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10200. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings and the time and effort I've put into it. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one more time, but this time, I'll go up to $10500. I think that's a fair price, considering the value the product brings and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a price that's below its true value. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $11500. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11500. I'm willing to make one last offer, and that's $10000. I think this is a fair price, considering the market value and my budget. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
