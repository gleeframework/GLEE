{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the product's value, making it more tempting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $120? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale without risking losing him completely and having to sell to John for less than my desired price."
