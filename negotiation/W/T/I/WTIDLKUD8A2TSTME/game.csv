"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $180 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could we try $80?  That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $80. Would you be willing to pay $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $140 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $90, but that's about as high as I can go.",90.0,Bob,6,
