"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $220 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $180 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could we try $80?  That's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $80. Would you be willing to pay $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $140 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $90, but that's about as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my valuation. While I could continue negotiating, it's risky to keep going lower and potentially lose out on John's guaranteed offer of $150."
