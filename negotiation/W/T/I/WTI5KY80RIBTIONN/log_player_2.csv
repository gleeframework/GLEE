"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to reach an agreement, so there's time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $12,000, I'm starting with my best offer to Alice.  This is a bold move, but it clearly sets my boundaries and hopefully encourages Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $16,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I have several rounds left.  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some flexibility but still staying within my desired range.  I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a good compromise, especially with multiple rounds left.  We're getting closer to a deal, and a $13,000 price point is more appealing than the $12,000 offer from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, $17,000 is still significantly above my preferred price point.  I'm not willing to pay this much and prefer to continue negotiations.  The $12,000 offer from John is still a tempting alternative, but I'm confident that with careful negotiation, I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $14,000, a more significant jump than in the last round. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and hopefully convinces Alice that we're nearing a deal. It's still below her last offer but represents a significant reduction from her initial asking price. With only 4 rounds remaining, time is becoming a factor, but I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $16,500 is still above my preferred price point.  It's getting close to my maximum budget, but I still have a few rounds left.  I'm hoping to see Alice's price drop further.  I'll continue negotiating for a better deal.  The $12,000 offer from John is still a strong backup option, but I'm confident that I can get a more favorable price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant jump in my offer, but I'm willing to take this risk with only two rounds remaining. This offer is still below Alice's last price, but it's getting very close to my maximum budget. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal and motivates Alice to accept. If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer in the final round."
