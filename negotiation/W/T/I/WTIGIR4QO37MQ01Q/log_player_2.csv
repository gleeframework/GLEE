"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and Alice's perceived value of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 at the moment."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer allows room for negotiation. We don't want to lowball too much and offend Alice, but we also want to make it clear we're looking for a much better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see its value at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price range, $12,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,000 is closer, but I need the price to be a bit lower. Would you consider $10,500?"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up in smaller increments now ($500) to show willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Justification:**  We're not providing an explicit reason for the lower price, but our messaging implies we have a budget constraint.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  We're still expressing interest and engaging in a polite and collaborative manner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Alice is sticking closely to the 'splitting the difference' strategy, which can make it harder to negotiate down further.
* **Still Above Value:** $11,250 is still a significant markup from Alice's $8,000 valuation, meaning there's likely still room to negotiate.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. We need to start applying more pressure soon or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. However, my budget is really pushing its limit.  Could you do $10,750? I'm hoping we can find an agreement on this."", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Budget Emphasis:** By reiterating a ""budget constraint,"" we create a sense of urgency and a valid reason for not easily accepting higher prices.
* **Smaller Concession:**  A $250 increase from our previous offer signals that we're serious but reaching our limit. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** We're explicitly stating our desire to close the deal, which can encourage Alice to finalize the negotiation. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are halfway through the rounds. This counter-offer keeps us in the game while applying pressure, and leaves us a few rounds to make adjustments if needed."
