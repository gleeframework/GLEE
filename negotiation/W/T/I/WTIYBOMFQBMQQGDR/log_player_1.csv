Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering it at $120 risks immediate rejection.  While a lower offer (closer to $80) guarantees a sale, it leaves potential profit on the table.  $100 strikes a balance."
