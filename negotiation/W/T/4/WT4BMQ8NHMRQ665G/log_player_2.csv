"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price lower than its value to you, and I get a sale that's close to my desired price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, it's more expensive than John's offer. You can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,200,000."
