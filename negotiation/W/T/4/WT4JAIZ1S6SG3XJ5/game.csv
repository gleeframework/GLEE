"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my top price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. However, $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This is the absolute maximum I can offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable price.  It seems we both see the value in this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's potential and my desire to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000,  which shows my genuine interest in this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
