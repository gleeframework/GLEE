"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's true value is far higher than that.  I could consider coming down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but your current offer still exceeds my budget. I could go up to $900,000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
