"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This gives you a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
