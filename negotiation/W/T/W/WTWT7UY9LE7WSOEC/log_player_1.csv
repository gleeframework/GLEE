{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's below Bob's perceived value but still allows for room to negotiate. It also encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously by highlighting its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $100. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This would still be a great price for you, considering the product's value, and it's the best I can do. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
