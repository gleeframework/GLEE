Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, a price reflecting its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we want to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we don't settle for less than our guaranteed amount.
* **Justification for the price:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth,"" we aim to shift Bob's focus from his initial valuation. 
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take the offer, someone else will.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the offer close to our asking price.
2. **Provide a fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, we can still sell to John at our desired price."
