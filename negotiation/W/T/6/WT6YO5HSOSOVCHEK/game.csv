"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us and we believe it's also a great value for you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, how about $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110. It's fair for both of us and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, how about $125? This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while staying within your budget.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to agree on a price of $120 for the product. This is the highest I can go, reflecting its true value and considering your budget constraints.",120.0,Alice,7,
