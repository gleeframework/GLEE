"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1500000. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe its value will far exceed that price for you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might exceed $1500000 for someone else, but given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet that price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1400000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1450000 to meet you halfway.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe you'll find the product more than worth that investment.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I am able to offer $1425000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions.",1425000.0,Bob,4,
