"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
