"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, giving him room to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above the product's worth to her. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for $10,000 outweighs the potential for further savings. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
