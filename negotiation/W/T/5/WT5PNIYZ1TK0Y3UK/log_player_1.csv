"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a higher price. I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my minimum desired price ($13,500 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer). Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit.  It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer entirely, especially as we are already nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds."
