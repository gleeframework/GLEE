"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $8,500?  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,250. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
