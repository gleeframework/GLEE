"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. It's likely Alice will accept a slightly lower price, as it's still more than her desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $9,000? That still leaves you with a good profit and gives me a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference at $9250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his next offer and ultimately he might have to buy from John for $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's and within his desired budget."
