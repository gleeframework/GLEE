"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number, I'm framing it as a fair price based on the product's value. This encourages Bob to engage in a value-based negotiation rather than a purely price-based one.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm explicitly asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
It's a risky move, but it sets a strong tone and could lead to a highly profitable outcome. If Bob immediately rejects this offer, I can significantly lower the price in the next round to demonstrate flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value of the product, signaling he's willing to go higher.  While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll aim to bring him closer to $1,700,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize your offer is a significant investment, the true value of this product goes beyond that. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects its potential to positively impact your business in the long run."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I've moved substantially from my initial price, but not so much that it seems desperate. This suggests I'm serious about finding a mutually beneficial deal but not willing to give it away.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's long-term benefits, subtly reminding Bob why he was interested in the first place. 
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $1,750,000 is a strong anchor. It's closer to my desired outcome while still giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,650,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but I believe there's still room to negotiate. Bob increasing his offer to $1,650,000 shows he is serious about the purchase. I'm aiming for a final price above $1,700,000, so I'll use the next round to incentivize him to move closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I recognize your commitment to finding a fair deal. To show my willingness to meet in the middle, I'll offer the product for $1,710,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1710000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I start by acknowledging Bob's effort in the negotiation, fostering a positive atmosphere. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final price. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,710,000 is a small concession on my part, but it still keeps the deal significantly above Bob's initial offer and his perceived value.  
* **Justification:** I'm not just dropping the price; I'm reiterating the value proposition to remind Bob why this price is justified. 

By framing this as my best and final offer, I'm putting the decision squarely in Bob's court. He can either accept a price significantly higher than his initial offer or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,680,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $1,680,000 is a strong price, exceeding both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Finality:** Bob has signaled that this is his final offer. Holding out for more could make him walk away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value.  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the time and effort involved might not be worth the marginal gain. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** John's offer provides a safety net, but accepting Bob's strong offer avoids the risk of him walking away entirely in later rounds."
