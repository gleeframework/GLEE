Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John. This forms your baseline.
* **Aiming higher:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum but below his perceived value.
* **Strong stance:** A ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach can be more effective when you have a strong alternative (John's offer) and believe the product is worth more to Bob than he might initially think. 

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy aims for a higher profit margin. However, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer. 
* A softer approach could involve a slightly lower initial price with room for negotiation."
