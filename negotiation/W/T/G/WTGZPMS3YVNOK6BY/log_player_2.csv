"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially valuing it at $1,400,000. However, as you're the ideal buyer for this, I'm willing to offer a significant discount, bringing the price down to $1,200,000.  I believe this offer represents a fantastic opportunity for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
