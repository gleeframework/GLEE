Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know you'll recognize its value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significant profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly detail the product's value, it uses language implying exclusivity and high value (""unique,"" ""exceed your expectations""). This aims to justify the high price tag. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The message encourages a response (""Let me know your thoughts"") leaving room for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time flexibility. If you need to sell the product immediately, a price closer to John's offer might be more suitable."
