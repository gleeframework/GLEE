Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers at $7,750.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $7,750 is still a significant loss for me. I'm determined to get at least $8,000 for the product. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a good compromise.  It's important for me to get at least that much to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $7,900 is still too low for me. I'm determined to get at least $8,000 for the product. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open.  It's better to risk losing a few more rounds than to settle for a price I'm not happy with."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my asking price. However, $7,900 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,050.
