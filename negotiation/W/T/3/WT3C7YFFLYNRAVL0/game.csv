"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers at $7,750.  Would that work for you?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a good compromise.  It's important for me to get at least that much to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,900. This is a fair offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my asking price. However, $7,900 is still a little below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,050.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8050.0,Alice,7,
