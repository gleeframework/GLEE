Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we compromise at $115? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While I could try to haggle further, Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $115. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
