"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $650,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a great deal and  allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price point, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $900,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value you'll receive.  I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.",900000.0,Alice,5,
