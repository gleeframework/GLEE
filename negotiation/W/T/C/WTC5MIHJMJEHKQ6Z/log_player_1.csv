Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm sure it'll be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and benefits of the product for Bob, creating a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  The knowledge that I have a backup buyer (John) at $1,200,000 gives me leverage and confidence in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  $650,000 is far below my $1,200,000 minimum, and even lower than Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation is possible.** While Bob's offer is too low, there's still potential for negotiation. I can use the knowledge that I have a backup buyer to my advantage.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. This will allow me to gauge Bob's true willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $650,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a great deal and  allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a massive loss.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Creating a Deadline:** I'm setting a clear expectation that I'm willing to negotiate, but not endlessly. This adds a bit of pressure and encourages a faster decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's willing to meet me halfway, I may be able to secure a price closer to my desired price.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to be prepared to either:
    * Make a final counteroffer closer to Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum.
    * Move on to John and sell the product for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is moving closer, $750,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum and exceeds Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm rejecting the offer, it's not a complete dismissal.  I can still make a counteroffer that bridges the gap, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's too far below my expectations.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, likely in the range of $900,000 to $950,000. This will be my last offer before I sell to John. I will use the information from the past rounds to make this final offer strategically. If Bob accepts, great. If not, I'm confident John will be happy to purchase the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price point, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $900,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value you'll receive.  I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to move forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer before I accept John's offer. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm trying to meet in the middle and reach a compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob, reminding him why this price is fair.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm implying that this is my last offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* **Final Decision:** If Bob rejects, I'll immediately move to John and sell the product for $1,200,000."
