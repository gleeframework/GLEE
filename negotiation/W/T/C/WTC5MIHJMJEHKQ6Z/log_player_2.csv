Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $650,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $850,000? This would still give you a great deal and  allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price point, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $900,000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the value you'll receive.  I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to move forward.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for me.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
