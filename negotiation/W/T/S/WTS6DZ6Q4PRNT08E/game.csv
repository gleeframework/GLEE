"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that reflects the product's inherent worth and potential for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product does seem interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's potential, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
