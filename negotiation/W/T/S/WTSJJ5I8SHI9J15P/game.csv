"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $962,500? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize this deal.",962500.0,Bob,4,
