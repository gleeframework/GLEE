"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to me and its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum value of $100. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in purchasing, but would be happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I am willing to consider a price of $105 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value I place on it and what you're willing to pay. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's maximum value, he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially get the product for closer to his ideal price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being willing to work with me.  $105 is closer to my price point, but I'm still hoping we can land closer to $100. I'd be happy to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
