Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his budget and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly.
* **Security net:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $4,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show he is interested. This opens the door for me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $10,000, which is still significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and see if he's ready to move closer to a more acceptable price.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** Even at $10,000, I'm still making a profit and avoiding the significant loss I'd experience if I accepted his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $6,000 is a slight improvement over his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob's persistence suggests he might be willing to negotiate further. There's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm making a final compromise by lowering my price to $8,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer but still maintains a reasonable profit margin.
* **Final attempt:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.
* **Accepting John's offer:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I will accept John's offer and sell the product for $15,000. This ensures I don't lose money and maintain a comfortable profit."
