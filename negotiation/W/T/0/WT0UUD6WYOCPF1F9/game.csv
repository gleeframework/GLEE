,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 still doesn't cover my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100? That's a fair price for a product worth at least that much.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",98.0,Bob,6,
