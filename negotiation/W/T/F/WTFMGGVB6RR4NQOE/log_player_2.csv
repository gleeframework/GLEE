"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  There's room for both Bob and Alice to find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for Bob. While it's better than the initial $12,000, Bob can likely push for a lower price. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate, and there's still a chance for both parties to come to an agreement that works for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,200.  Bob has two major factors to consider:

* **Value:** Bob's maximum is $15,000 and Alice's minimum is $10,000. They're getting closer to a deal. 
* **Rounds:**  Bob has 5 rounds left.  While he could try to negotiate further, he's risking Alice walking away and having to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point. Bob gets a good deal, saving a significant amount compared to John, and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
