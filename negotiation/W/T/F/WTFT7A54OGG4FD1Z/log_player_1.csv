Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price that reflects its exceptional value.  Considering its potential, I believe $950,000 is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a good rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential to emphasize its worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By not starting at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I leave myself room to negotiate without immediately cutting off the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is a good price for Bob, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Bob has shown interest, and by rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John as an Alternative:** I have John as a backup option who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference - how about $900,000? This price recognizes the value of the product while still giving you a good deal.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefits:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefits for both of us, making it clear that a deal is still possible.
* **Stay Above Minimum:** I'm not dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal."
