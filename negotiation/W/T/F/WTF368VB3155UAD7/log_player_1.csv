Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $850,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but not excessively so. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the opportunity and value.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being rejected outright. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't be stuck if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $850,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer signals that he's interested in the product, but willing to negotiate. 
* **Leverage John:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $800,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at this price. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway at my minimum price point. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but firm on my minimum.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my ""final offer"" to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leverage:** I'm reminding Bob of the other buyer (John) to add pressure and highlight my position.

This approach aims to secure my minimum price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but still below it.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, potentially below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of going below my minimum price outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and minimizes risk."
