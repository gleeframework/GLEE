Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation, or if I should simply sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I will counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and come closer to my price.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I would prefer to make a profit beyond that, I am not willing to risk further negotiations. The potential for further counteroffers and delays doesn't outweigh the certainty of securing $1,000,000 from John."
