"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can explore if there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's $50,000 lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness in negotiating while also leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it still saves him a significant amount compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it risks losing the deal with Alice altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
