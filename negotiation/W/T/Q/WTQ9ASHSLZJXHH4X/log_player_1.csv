While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.  This would be a fair compromise, and we could both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}

```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is a significant improvement, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now, but if he doesn't budge, I'm ready to sell to John in the next round."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting very close to a deal, but Bob's offer of $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I only have two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $120 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get the best possible price."
