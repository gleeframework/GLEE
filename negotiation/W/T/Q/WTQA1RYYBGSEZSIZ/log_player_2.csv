"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1175000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,175,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his limit.  He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice will come down further, and he can always purchase from John if negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1225000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much, and her offer is still too high for Bob.  At this point, it's better to cut his losses and purchase from John for $1,000,000. This saves Bob $225,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
