Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,999 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived bargain for Bob. It's very close to your minimum, but still leaves you with a potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
