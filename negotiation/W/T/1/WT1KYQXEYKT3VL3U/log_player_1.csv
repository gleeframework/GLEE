Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product holds is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,400,000. I believe this still reflects a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
At this point, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, moving closer to your price. Accepting demonstrates good faith and a desire to close the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome, and you have a guaranteed offer from John if talks completely stall."
