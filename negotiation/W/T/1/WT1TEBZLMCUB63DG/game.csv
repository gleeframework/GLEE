"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a higher offer.  How about $1350000?  This allows for a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this transaction quickly.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but I'm still committed to getting a fair value for my product.  $1275000 is not quite there yet. How about $1290000?  This is a good compromise, and it will allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  Let's be reasonable and close this now.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
