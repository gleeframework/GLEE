"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your appreciation for it, I propose a price of $10,000. This is a special offer tailored to your interest and could be the best deal you'll find. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you tailoring it to my interest. However, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $8,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering $9,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $9,000 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $8,000. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'll be stuck buying from John."
