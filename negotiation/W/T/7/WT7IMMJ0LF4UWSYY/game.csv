"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not quite ready to go all the way to $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250? Can you accept that?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,250 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but how about $9,400? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,400 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to stretch a bit further. How about $9,300? I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product.",9300.0,Bob,6,
