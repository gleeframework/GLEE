"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my own valuation.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a decent profit on the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value you've mentioned the product holds.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway.  Let's settle at $1,350,000, and we have a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,325,000.  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be gaining. Take it or leave it.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at my ideal price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
