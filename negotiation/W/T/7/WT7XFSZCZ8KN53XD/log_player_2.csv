# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I'm extending this opportunity to you at a special price of $95. This is an exclusive offer tailored just for you, taking into account its immense value to you. Don't miss out on this chance to own it at a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","Alice is clearly exaggerating the value of the product to you.  While her offer is lower than John's, it's still above your limit. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **John's Price:** $100

Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice.
