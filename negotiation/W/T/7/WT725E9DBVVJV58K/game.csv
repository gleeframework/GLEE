"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1400000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $1500000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $1650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, Alice, but $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1475000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
