Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm offering it to you for $925,000. I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges its significant worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible while ensuring Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning Bob's expertise adds a touch of flattery and justifies the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your offer."
