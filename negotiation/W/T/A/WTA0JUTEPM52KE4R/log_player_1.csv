Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. This offer won't last long."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John). Therefore, she starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning the offer won't last, Alice attempts to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price than he would with more time to consider. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer assumes there's no room for negotiation. If Alice is open to negotiation, she might start lower (but still above $15,000).
* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially influenced by scarcity tactics. If Alice knows Bob is a very savvy and unemotional buyer, a different approach might be needed."
