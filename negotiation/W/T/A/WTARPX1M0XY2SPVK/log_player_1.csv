Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit. 
* **John's Offer:** Keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind, I'm willing to go down a bit to make the deal with Bob more appealing. 
* **Value Gap:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so I'm offering a price that's still significantly above his perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects it, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  If Bob's offer is too low or if the negotiation drags on, I can always switch to John and sell for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000 and is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee a much higher profit.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but Bob's offer is too low to accept at this stage. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, hoping to secure a better deal without losing the opportunity to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer of $11,000.  
* **Maintaining Profit:**  This price still allows me to make a profit, although less than my initial desired amount.
* **Avoiding John:**  I want to see if we can reach an agreement with Bob before turning to John as it might take longer to find another buyer like John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider whether to counter again, or if it's time to sell to John.  
* **Finding Common Ground:** My goal is to find a price that works for both of us, where we can both feel like we got a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is only $3,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it risks delaying the sale and potentially losing John as a buyer.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of losing out on a potential deal with John.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures I make a profit and avoids the potential delays and risks associated with further negotiation."
