Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
