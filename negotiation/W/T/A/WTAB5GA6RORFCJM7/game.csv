"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,3,
