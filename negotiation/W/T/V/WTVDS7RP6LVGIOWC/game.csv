"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is my best offer for now.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on the price.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer for now.",13000.0,Alice,5,
