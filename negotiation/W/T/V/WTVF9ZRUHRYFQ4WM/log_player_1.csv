**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I have 9 rounds left and John's offer of $1,000,000 is a safety net."

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to be more patient and see if I can get closer to my desired price. John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net, giving me confidence to continue negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only $15,000 away from my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I have 4 rounds remaining, and I believe I can potentially push for a higher price.  John's offer of $1,000,000 remains my safety net, allowing me to continue negotiating without significant risk."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, the time is running out.  Bob's final offer of $887,500 is only $12,500 away from my minimum value, but it still falls short of my desired price.  Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I'm choosing to secure the deal with him and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees a profitable outcome and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
