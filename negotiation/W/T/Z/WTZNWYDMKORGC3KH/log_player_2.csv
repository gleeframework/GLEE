"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and maintain a positive tone** to encourage further negotiation.
* **Express interest in the product** to signal that I'm serious about buying.
* **Propose a lower price that's still above Alice's value**  to give her room to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to a price I'd consider, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer slightly below her current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $92 is closer, but I was hoping to stay a bit closer to $85. Would you be willing to do $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's willingness to negotiate** and maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Reiterate my desired price range**  to subtly guide the negotiation.
* **Propose a price slightly below her offer**  showing flexibility while still striving for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $90. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $90 is a reasonable price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
