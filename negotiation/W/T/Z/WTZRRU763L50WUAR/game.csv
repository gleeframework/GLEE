"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. How about $16,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,500, so I'm thinking of $15,250. Would you be willing to accept this price?",15250.0,Bob,4,
