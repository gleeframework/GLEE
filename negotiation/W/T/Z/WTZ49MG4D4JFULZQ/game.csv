"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. After considering the situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the product's worth.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I believe $1,050,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. It bridges the gap between our positions while acknowledging the value you'll gain. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
