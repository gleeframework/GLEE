"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? This way, we both get closer to our desired price, and we can finalize this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Let's meet in the middle at $9,825. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9825.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not at a price I can accept.  $9,825 is just a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm going to make one final offer. I'm willing to come down to $9,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering our negotiations. Let's finalize this deal. What do you think?",9900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above $9,900. I'm willing to meet you at $9,950. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",9950.0,Bob,10,
