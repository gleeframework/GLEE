Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves space for potential negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth $19,000 to Bob, it hints at additional value he might gain. This leaves Bob curious and open to understanding your perspective.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects or negotiates, you can adjust accordingly, knowing you have John as a backup."
