"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $2,000,000. This is still a very competitive price considering the potential returns you'll get.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
