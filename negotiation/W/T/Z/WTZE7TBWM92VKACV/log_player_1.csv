"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. Could we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to stay within my budget of $100. Can we negotiate further towards that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from him.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
