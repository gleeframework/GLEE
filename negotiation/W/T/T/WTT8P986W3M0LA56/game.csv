"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant about $11,500.  I think $11,000 would be a fair price that we could both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,250. It's a slight reduction from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $11,100? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",11100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,
