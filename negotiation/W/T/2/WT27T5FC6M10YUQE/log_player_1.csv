"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Bob knows the product is worth less to him, so he'll likely counteroffer. We'll see how far we can go before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $175 is a good middle ground, and hopefully, he'll be willing to meet me there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $150.  I'll take it!"
