"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $8,000 is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 reflects the product's true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. Buying from John is still an option, but Bob should explore all possibilities before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you believe the product is worth $12,000, but $10,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
