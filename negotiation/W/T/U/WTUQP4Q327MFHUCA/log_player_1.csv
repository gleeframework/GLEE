Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate. While Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives its value differently or has a strong need for it.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, bringing you closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, acting as a strong safety net. This allows you to be bolder in your initial ask to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with potential negotiation. Be prepared to justify the price or potentially lower it slightly if Bob pushes back."
