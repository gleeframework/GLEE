"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is there any wiggle room in your price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to take another step towards you. I can offer you $130, which is closer to your latest offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'm thinking $122.50. Is that a price you'd be willing to meet?",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to take another step towards you. I can offer you $128, which is still a great deal for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of $128 and $120, which would be $124. Let's see if we can meet in the middle now.",124.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint, but I think I can do better. I can offer you $126, which is still a great deal for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",126.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at the price I was willing to pay from the start, which is $120. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John.",120.0,Bob,10,
