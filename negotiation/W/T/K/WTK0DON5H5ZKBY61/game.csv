"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant savings compared to my original offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,340,000. It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,330,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,335,000. This is a very fair price, and it gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",1335000.0,Alice,7,
