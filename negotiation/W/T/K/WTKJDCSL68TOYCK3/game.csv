"Thanks for offering, Alice!  I do think this product would be useful, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $6,500 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value to you, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're finding some common ground. To be honest, $9,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go. If that doesn't work, I understand.",9000.0,Alice,5,
