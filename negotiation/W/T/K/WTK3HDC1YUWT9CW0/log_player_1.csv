{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

This offer starts with a strong price that leaves room for negotiation.  It's also important to be friendly and positive in your message to encourage Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting the price. However, I would like to stick closer to my initial offer. I propose $10,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the value of the product to me, and also the price I would get from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating, so I'll accept his offer."
