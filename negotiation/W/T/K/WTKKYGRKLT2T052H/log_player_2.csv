"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm not willing to go below this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you, given that it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit in price, but $1,275,000 is still outside my comfort zone and closer to my limit.  Rather than risk going back and forth further and possibly driving up the price, I'll take John's offer of $1,000,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
