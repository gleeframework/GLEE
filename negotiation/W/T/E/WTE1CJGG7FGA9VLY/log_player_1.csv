{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""one-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** The $800,000 backup offer from John provides a safety net, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines. 

By offering the product at $950,000, Alice stands to gain a significant profit while still offering Bob a price that's below his perceived value."
