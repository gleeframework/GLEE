"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at this point.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However, $8,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,875. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while also offering you a great deal on this product.  Let's finalize this transaction.  ",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",8800.0,Bob,6,
