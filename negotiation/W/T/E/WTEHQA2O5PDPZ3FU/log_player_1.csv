Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still above my minimum value but is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk further lowering the price.  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is my minimum.  Therefore, I'm selling the product to John."
