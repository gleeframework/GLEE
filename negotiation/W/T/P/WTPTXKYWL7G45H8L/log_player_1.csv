Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However,  $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a price I'd find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach $100. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed offer."
