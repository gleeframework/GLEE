``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling it for $950000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

**Explanation:**

* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I will use the next round to counter Bob's offer and try to close the gap.
