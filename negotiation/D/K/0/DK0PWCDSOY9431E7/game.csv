"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a substantial deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your hesitation, but this product offers significant returns beyond a typical investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,825,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
