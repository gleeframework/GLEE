I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a good profit while hopefully being appealing enough for Bob to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 865000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $865,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but hopefully enough to entice him to accept. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, so I want to avoid getting stuck with the John deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $875,000, I'm running out of time.  $862,000 is still a good profit and significantly more than what I'd get from John."
