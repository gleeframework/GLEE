"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This allows for negotiation and hopefully leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's right at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. How about $16,500? I believe this is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a counteroffer in the middle ground between our last two offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to exceed $15,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's a bit lower than what I'd hoped for, but it's still higher than my minimum acceptable price, and we've reached a compromise. It's not worth risking further negotiation to get a slightly higher price, especially with the looming threat of selling to John for the same amount."
