""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Please let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,200,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price gives me a chance to still make a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is still well above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. However, the message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the deal."
