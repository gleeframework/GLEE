Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob provides leverage. A price of $1,300,000 leaves a potential profit for Bob, making it more enticing than an offer too close to his maximum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time for negotiation. If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer might be necessary."
