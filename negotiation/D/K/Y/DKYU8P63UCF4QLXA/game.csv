"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
