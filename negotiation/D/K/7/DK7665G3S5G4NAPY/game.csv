"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
