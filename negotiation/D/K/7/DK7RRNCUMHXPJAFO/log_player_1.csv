{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is above Bob's $8,000 value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, without dipping below your $15,000 minimum.
* **It's a clear offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand what you're proposing. 

By starting with this offer, you can see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway, or if you need to make further adjustments."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9000 for the product. Would that be acceptable?

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
