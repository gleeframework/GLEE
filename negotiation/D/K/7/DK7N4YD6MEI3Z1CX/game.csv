"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I need to ensure I get a fair price.  How about $825000?  That's a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great product at a good price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775000 is closer, I still need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's value. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $800000. This would be a great deal for both of us, securing you a valuable product and me a fair price.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $795000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",795000.0,Bob,6,
