Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product,  $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.

I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the upper end of its value,  $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe it's truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects its significant value while still providing you with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 remains outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I believe this represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
