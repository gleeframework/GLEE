"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like this is a good opportunity.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, which could incentivize him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than my ideal sale price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price that's more attractive to me and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Exploring Options:**  Selling to John is always a possibility, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first to maximize my potential earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the significant value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:**  I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Shared Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to his business, emphasizing the potential benefits he'll gain from acquiring it.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to encourage Bob to see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit.  It's safer than continuing to negotiate and risking a stalemate."
