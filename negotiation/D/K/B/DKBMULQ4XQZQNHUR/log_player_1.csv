Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value and potential. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, but allows me to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly increasing his offer price. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to hold firm a bit longer and see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this deal. How about $900,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to signal that we're getting close to our bottom line. This offer represents a significant profit margin while still being palatable for Bob. By making it clear this is our final offer, we increase the pressure on him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very invested in acquiring this product. While we could potentially push for a bit more, accepting the $890,000 offer secures a very good profit. It's not worth risking the deal collapsing over a relatively small difference in price at this point."
