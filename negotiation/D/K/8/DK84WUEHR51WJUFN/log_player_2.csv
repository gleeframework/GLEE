"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for my asking price of $75. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate. There's a good chance I can get a better price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. It also helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $65 for the product? This still gives you a good deal while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer. I'll push a little further and see if she'll come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $62?  That's a fair price that works for me."", 
""product_price"": 62
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price slightly below the midpoint between her last offer and my last counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to move, but also sets a firm target. It's getting close to the point where I might consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge much further."
