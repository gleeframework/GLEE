"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $800,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
