,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
