"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a steal for the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Enthusiastic message:** A positive and persuasive message might encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is far too low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I can use the remaining rounds to try and reach a price closer to my goal.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work. This price still gives you a significant return on your investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still being above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize the return on investment for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits of owning the product.
* **Setting a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away the product for a price that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1550000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go to $1350000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are only four rounds in, and with ten rounds total, I have time to continue negotiations and try to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get Bob to meet my minimum, I can still sell to John for a satisfactory price. 

I'm confident that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This price allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not sacrificing too much.
* **Focusing on compromise:** I emphasize ""meeting halfway"" to make the offer seem fair and collaborative.
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language like ""walk away happy"" to create a sense of shared success.

This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiations moving forward while still keeping my minimum price in mind.  With five rounds left, there is still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me, and it ensures both of us walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to accept it yet.
* **Negotiation leverage:** We have four rounds left. There's still time to try and push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I believe I can convince Bob to increase his offer further by continuing to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,475,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, but firm:** This offer is a smaller reduction from my previous price, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but not drastically change my stance.
* **Emphasis on finality:** I use phrases like ""finalize this deal"" and ""make this happen"" to encourage Bob to see this as the last step before agreement.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,475,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal.

With only three rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to make a decision. This offer allows for a potential agreement while keeping my minimum price in mind."
