"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant price drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's still above her product's worth. However, if she rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still higher than my maximum budget. Although I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best deal I can get within my budget."
