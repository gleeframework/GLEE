{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation, giving him some room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit for you. It also leaves you some space to lower the price if necessary without going below your minimum threshold."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum threshold."
