"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has tremendous potential and would be a great addition to your portfolio. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. If you're not willing to accept, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my own investment.
