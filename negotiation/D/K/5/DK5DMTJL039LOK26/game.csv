"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal. I'll come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
