,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $8,000 to you.  Let's try to close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $8,200.  It's only $200 more than your last offer, and I think it's a good price for a product that's clearly valuable to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your understanding, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is my minimum.  This is my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to sell the product to someone else.",8000.0,Alice,7,
