Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than $900,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my best offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,000,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.
