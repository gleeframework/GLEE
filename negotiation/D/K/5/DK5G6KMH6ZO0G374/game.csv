"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in a bonus feature that's worth $10. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
