"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($120) is above your maximum price target ($150).** 
* **You know John will sell it to you for $150.** While this is your absolute maximum, it's better to see if Alice will lower her price.  There's a chance to negotiate a better deal."
