"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I have a unique product I believe you'll find valuable. Considering its worth to someone like you, I'm offering it for $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  He should aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. While $950,000 is tempting, I believe this product has the potential to yield even greater returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is a good sign, but there's still potential for a better deal. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $950,000.  While John's offer is still on the table, Bob is likely to get a better price from Alice if he persists in the negotiations."

This would be a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
