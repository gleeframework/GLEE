"Hello Bob, I'm Alice and I have a unique product I believe you'll find valuable. Considering its worth to someone like you, I'm offering it for $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. While $950,000 is tempting, I believe this product has the potential to yield even greater returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. While I recognize the potential of this product, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe it would be a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
