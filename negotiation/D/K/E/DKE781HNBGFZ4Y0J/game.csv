"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate you countering, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, to be frank, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a valuable asset.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate that.  While I value your offer,  I can't let this product go for less than $1,600,000.  It's a truly unique asset, and I believe this price accurately reflects its value. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm ready to close this deal, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. I'll go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the final offer I can make.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
