"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to leave room for negotiation. This price is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but not so high that it immediately discourages him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price, I'm not willing to sell to John yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer and my minimum desired price. I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept while also securing a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell for more, it's unlikely he will offer more. Additionally, selling to John would result in the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale without risking further negotiation."
