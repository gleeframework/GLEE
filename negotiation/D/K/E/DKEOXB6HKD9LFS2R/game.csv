"I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth and the value it can bring you.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $1,600,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,450,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable return on your investment.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I need to be comfortable with the price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
