Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, leaving a good amount of room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price of $800,000. Bob knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so there's incentive for him to negotiate. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $1,100,000. This is a compromise,  meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It still gives me a good profit while potentially encouraging Bob to make a final concession."
