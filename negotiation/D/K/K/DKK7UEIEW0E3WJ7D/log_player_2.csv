"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You can get the product for less than Alice's offer, so it makes sense to try and negotiate further. 
* You have a higher maximum price you're willing to pay than Alice's minimum. This means there's room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is $1,100,000, which is still below your maximum price of $1,500,000.
* There's a chance you might be able to negotiate a lower price, but it's not guaranteed.
* It's safer to accept the current offer, as it's a good price for you and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
