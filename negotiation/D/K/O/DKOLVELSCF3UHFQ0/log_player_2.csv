It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  We know we can get it for $100 from John, so we have some room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
