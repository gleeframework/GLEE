"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to establish a much lower price point, closer to Alice's value. It might encourage her to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $7,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can still negotiate further.  Splitting the difference again puts us too close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you have costs to cover.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her previous offer ($8,500) and our last counter-offer ($7,000). It shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a significantly lower price than her initial offer and John's alternative."
