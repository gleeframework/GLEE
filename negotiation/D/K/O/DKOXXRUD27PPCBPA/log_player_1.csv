"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting high ($1,100,000) to give myself room to negotiate down while staying well above my minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions ""negotiations,"" signaling to Bob that I'm open to adjusting the price.
* **Positive Framing:** The language emphasizes the product's value and uses a positive tone to encourage a deal. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness to Pay:**  His response will indicate how close he is to my target price.
2. **Maintain Leverage:** By starting high, I maintain a strong negotiating position. 
3. **Keep the John Option Open:** I haven't committed to Bob yet, so I retain the option of selling to John for my minimum price if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to find a mutually agreeable price, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap. I'm keeping the John option open as a safety net but aiming to reach a deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, this concession keeps me well above my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This framing aims to maintain the product's perceived worth while justifying a price closer to my target.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to move significantly from his initial offer, it might be time to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now only $200,000 below my minimum acceptable price. While I could hold out for more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of negotiations failing. 

Here's why accepting is now the best strategy:

* **Strong Profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale price still represents a substantial profit. 
* **Minimized Risk:** Accepting now eliminates the chance of Bob walking away or negotiations breaking down.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows me to reinvest the funds more quickly.

While selling to John would guarantee the full $1,200,000, the relatively small difference in profit doesn't justify the increased risk of continuing negotiations."
