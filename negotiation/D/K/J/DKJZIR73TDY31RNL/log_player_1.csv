Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value, as I'm sure you recognize. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $1,075,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I still believe the product's worth is higher.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,090,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as high as I can go. How about we meet at $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,080,000 is a significant profit over your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
