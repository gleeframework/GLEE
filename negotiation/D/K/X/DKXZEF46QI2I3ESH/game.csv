"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're on a budget, $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000 to make this work for both of us. This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within a budget, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $10500.  This price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's the most I can afford.",10000.0,Bob,6,
