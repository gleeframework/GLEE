"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
