Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm starting to get a little anxious about potentially losing this sale, $8,750 is still not close enough to my minimum. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here. I'm willing to come down to $8,900 as a final compromise. This is a really good price for you, and it's the closest I can go. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where it's clear that Bob and I are not going to agree on a price that works for both of us. I'm getting too close to the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000 to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
