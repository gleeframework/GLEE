"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product holds value for me,  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,350,000 is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good deal:** You've managed to negotiate down from Alice's initial price of $1,400,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. It's possible she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying more, or you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
