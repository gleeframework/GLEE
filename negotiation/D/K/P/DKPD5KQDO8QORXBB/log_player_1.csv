Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you value the product highly.
* **Not Too High:** While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting at that price leaves no room for negotiation and might seem too aggressive. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $1,400,000 is a strong opening offer that still gives Bob a potential $100,000 gain while securing a significant portion of the potential profit for you. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" indicating your willingness to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential gain and leaving space for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product holds value for me,  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than your target price and his perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** Show Bob you believe the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Negotiate Further:** Aim for a price closer to your desired range. 

You can afford to negotiate further since Bob's offer is already above your minimum acceptable price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** Meeting Bob halfway demonstrates flexibility while still holding onto a strong position.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""undervalued potential"" reinforces the product's worth.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  Mentioning a ""fair agreement"" nudges Bob towards a decision without resorting to threats of walking away (yet). 

This approach aims to secure a higher price while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
