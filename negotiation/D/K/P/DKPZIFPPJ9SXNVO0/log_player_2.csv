(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget. He wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation, aiming to get a deal close to his maximum budget."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still outside Bob's ideal price range.  There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  It's also important to remember that buying from John is always an option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. He's still aiming to stay below his maximum budget of $800,000 but is demonstrating a willingness to move towards Alice's price.  This move increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. While she has made a concession, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to his desired price. If the negotiation fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer, showing his commitment to reaching an agreement with Alice. This offer is closer to Alice's most recent price and is likely to be more attractive to her.  It's still within Bob's acceptable range while getting closer to his goal of saving as much money as possible."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a small reduction from her previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  There are only a few rounds left, so Bob needs to be strategic.  He's likely to be able to get a better deal from Alice with a few more counteroffers.  It's also important to remember that he can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing closer to his maximum budget but is still trying to get the best possible price. With only two rounds left, he needs to show Alice that he's serious about a deal. This offer demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's within his acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. While she's lowered her price again, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's a high risk that even if Bob makes another counteroffer, Alice won't accept it, leaving him with no deal. With limited time remaining, the safest and most cost-effective option is to buy from John for $800,000.  This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
