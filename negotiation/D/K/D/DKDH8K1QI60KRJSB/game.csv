"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business. My asking price is $950,000. This reflects the product's potential to generate substantial returns for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm proposing a price of $850,000, which still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
