"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to her own value of the product.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than what I want to pay. I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high for me. How about $1,100,000?  That seems like a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of a price of $1,220,000. It's a fair price considering the value you've put on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only asking for $1,220,000, which is very close to my maximum value of $1,500,000 for the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me missing out on the product is too high.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product and saves me $280,000 compared to buying from John."
