"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great value for the product. Let me know what you think!",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",12900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,900, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. How about we settle on $13,000? It's just a small difference from your last offer and would allow me to move forward with the sale. I truly believe this product is worth it to you, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
