Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire it before anyone else. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value,"" I subtly imply that the asking price is justified.
* **Urgency:** By saying I'll list it publicly, I create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
