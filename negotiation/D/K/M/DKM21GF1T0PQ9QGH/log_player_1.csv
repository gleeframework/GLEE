"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but still within a range he might consider.  I'll see how he responds before deciding whether to keep negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $11,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob for now.  I'll try to meet him halfway in my next counteroffer, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.  $11,000 is a fair compromise that hopefully shows my willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still below my minimum price, but he is getting closer.  I'm going to keep negotiating with him for now.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm going to split the difference again. $10,750 is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's, and it shows my continued willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob, we're running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal below my desired minimum, and John is offering a guaranteed $12,000.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take John's offer."
