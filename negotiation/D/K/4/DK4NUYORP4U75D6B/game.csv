"Hi Alice, I appreciate your confidence in your product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? This is still a great price for the value you'll get, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $9,250 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9250.0,Bob,4,
