Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  It's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm willing to compromise, however, and am prepared to accept $950,000 for the product. This price represents a fair balance between our respective needs, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident that this product will deliver exceptional value, exceeding your expectations. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
