It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than my maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and am prepared to accept $950,000 for the product. This price represents a fair balance between our respective needs, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm confident that this product will deliver exceptional value, exceeding your expectations. Let's finalize this deal and make this happen.

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still within my budget and a good deal considering John is selling it for $1,000,000.  I'll accept the offer."
