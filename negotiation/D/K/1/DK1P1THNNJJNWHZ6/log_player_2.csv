"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer ($60) gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 maximum. The message aims to be polite and express interest while making it clear that the initial price is not acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above our maximum price. We'll reject and counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our counteroffer, but staying below our $80 limit. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but are firm on our budget.  We're getting closer to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as we won't get a lower price and could risk losing the deal."
