"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to reach a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would help us reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. How about we meet at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,750 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option at this point, as Bob has time to continue bargaining and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair here, Alice. $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the deadline, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,250 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Additionally, Bob has time for two more rounds of negotiation. It is still advantageous to reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're running out of time, but $10,250 is still more than I can afford. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about we meet at $10,500, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round, and Alice's final offer is still $10,500, which is above Bob's budget. While Alice is offering additional value, Bob has no way of knowing if it's truly worth the difference. With only one round left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high. It's more prudent for Bob to buy from John at $12,000 to guarantee he gets the product and avoids further negotiation."
