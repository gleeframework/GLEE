,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would help us reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. How about we meet at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to be fair here, Alice. $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the deadline, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're running out of time, but $10,250 is still more than I can afford. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal. ",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about we meet at $10,500, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal?",10500.0,Alice,9,
