"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
