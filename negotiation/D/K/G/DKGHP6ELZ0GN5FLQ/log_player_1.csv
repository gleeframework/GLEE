Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, maximizing her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't settle for less than that amount.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice has insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), she can adjust her offer and messaging accordingly.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable, Alice might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill."
