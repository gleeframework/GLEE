Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm confident that this product can be a valuable asset for my business, but I can't justify going above $900,000 at this time. This price is still a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value considering our earlier discussions.
