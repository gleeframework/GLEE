"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a fair starting point for our negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that this product can be a valuable asset for my business, but I can't justify going above $900,000 at this time. This price is still a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value considering our earlier discussions.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be responsible with your budget, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a compromise, and I hope you can see the value in making this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still outside my financial comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a substantial investment for me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to move forward with this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum requirements, and I need to prioritize my own needs. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
