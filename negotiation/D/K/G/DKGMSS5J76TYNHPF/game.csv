"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1200000. It's a steal for something worth a million to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest. However, $900000 is too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original price. I'm offering $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product.  I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
