"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, there's room for her to drop her price.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob signals that he's willing to walk away, putting pressure on Alice to lower her price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push Alice to come closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she is unwilling to go lower than $1,050,000.  Bob is determined to save as much money as possible, and since he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, that is the best option for him. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price."
