"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price.  I'm looking to pay closer to $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential savings you can achieve by closing a deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1000000 is the absolute top I can go, and I'm confident this price will be beneficial for both of us.  It allows you to sell quickly while offering me a great value.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
