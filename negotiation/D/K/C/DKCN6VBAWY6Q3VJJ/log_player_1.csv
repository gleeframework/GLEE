Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. This offer is very close to your initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's try to finalize this deal.
