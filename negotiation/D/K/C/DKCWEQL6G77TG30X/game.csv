"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $14,500 is fair. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $8,000. Could you consider $13,000? I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a significant move from my last offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
