"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm going to counter with $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your counteroffer and my original offer, so I'm going to counter with $1250000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm going to counter with $1300000 again, but this time it's not a compromise, it's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
