"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $11,500.  This is a significant discount, considering what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party who's ready to purchase it for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob."
