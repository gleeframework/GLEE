Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $90, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $105. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and we have the option to buy from John for $100. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings at this point."
