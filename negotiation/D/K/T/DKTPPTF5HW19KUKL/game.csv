"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. This is my last offer. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
