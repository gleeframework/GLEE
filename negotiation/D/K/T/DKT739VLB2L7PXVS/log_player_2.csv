"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me, as the product's value is significantly higher.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any lower than $850,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

It's no longer worth the effort to haggle with Alice. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Take the guaranteed savings."
