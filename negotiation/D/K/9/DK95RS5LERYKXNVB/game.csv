,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
