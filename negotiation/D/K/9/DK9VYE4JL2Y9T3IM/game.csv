"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That way we both get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really committed to this deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,750 is simply too low. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
