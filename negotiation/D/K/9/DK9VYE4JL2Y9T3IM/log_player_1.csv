"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob, rather than just focusing on the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation and a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,250?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's price but still higher than my minimum. This shows flexibility and encourages continued negotiation.
* **Compromise Language:**  ""Fair compromise"" implies that I'm being reasonable and willing to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a profit margin closer to my desired goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better price.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher offer from Bob or, if needed, sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really committed to this deal. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,750 is simply too low. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I reiterate my desire to make a deal but also maintain a firm stance on the price.
* **""Fair Price"" for Both:**  I emphasize that $9,000 is a good deal for both of us, encouraging compromise.
* **Closing Language:**  ""What do you say?"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still pushing towards a price closer to my desired goal."
