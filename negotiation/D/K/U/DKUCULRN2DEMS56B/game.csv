"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
