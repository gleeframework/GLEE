``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us, signaling flexibility. 

This strategy aims to:

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Showing a willingness to reject Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Explore Other Options:**  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to come up further or if I should explore selling to John in later rounds.
* **Negotiate Further:**  Rejecting the offer opens the door for me to make a counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the offer as beneficial.
* **Positive and Collaborative:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

This strategy aims to:

* **Move the Negotiation Forward:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm actively participating in the negotiation and eager to reach an agreement.
* **Increase the Chances of Acceptance:**  The counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not giving in too quickly, keeping some leverage to potentially negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have leverage and want to push for a higher price.  Here's why I'm rejecting the offer:

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate and still value the product highly. This might encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Negotiating Power:** I have 6 rounds remaining. By rejecting, I can try to get a higher price or potentially sell to John if the negotiation stalls.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I believe there's still room for a price that works for both of us.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further discussion.

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $950,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm happy to continue working with you. How about $935,000?  It's a fair compromise between our last two offers and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable compromise range. This shows my willingness to meet him halfway without completely caving.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm emphasizing a positive tone and encouraging a deal. This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoids any negative feelings.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the fact that this offer represents a fair compromise between both of our positions. This can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept. 

By offering $935,000, I aim to:

* **Bridge the Gap:** This offer further narrows the gap between our desired prices, making it more appealing for Bob.
* **Increase the Chances of Acceptance:**  A compromise offer like this is often more likely to be accepted than a more rigid stance.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm still not accepting Bob's offer outright, which keeps me in a strong negotiating position."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $915,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I want to see if I can get closer to $935,000 before considering selling to John. Here's why I'm rejecting the offer:

* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate and still value the product highly. This might encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Negotiating Power:** I have 4 rounds remaining. By rejecting, I can try to get a higher price or potentially sell to John if the negotiation stalls.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I believe there's still room for a price that works for both of us.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further discussion. 

I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $925,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  we're getting very close to a deal. How about $925,000? It's a fair compromise considering both of our previous offers, and it gets us much closer to a final agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing the Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle of our two previous offers. This shows my continued willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and directly asking for Bob's thoughts. This keeps the conversation moving forward and avoids any ambiguity.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to meet me at $910,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer dropping below my minimum, it's time to cut my losses and move on. I've been negotiating for a while, and while I've managed to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking another round.  

* **Time is Running Out:**  With two rounds left, there's not enough time to realistically reach my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Further Reduction:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer in the next round, pushing me further below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation headaches.

This decision balances the desire for a higher profit with the reality of the situation and the potential for further losses."
