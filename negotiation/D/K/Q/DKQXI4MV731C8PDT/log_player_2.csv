"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling she's getting close to her limit. While we might squeeze out a little more in further rounds, the risk of her walking away or holding firm outweighs the potential savings at this point.  $1,075,000 is a reasonable deal."
