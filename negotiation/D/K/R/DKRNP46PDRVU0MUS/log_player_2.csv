"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. While you could reject it hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower, and you risk having to buy from John at the higher price."
