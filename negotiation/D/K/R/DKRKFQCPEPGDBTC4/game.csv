"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is considerably less than I believe the product is worth.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,800,000 is still  more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
