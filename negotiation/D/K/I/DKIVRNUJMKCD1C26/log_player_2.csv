# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to part with it for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer is above your budget and what you'd pay to John. You can do better by rejecting her offer and seeing if she counters with a lower price or going with John."
