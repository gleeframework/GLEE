"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the conversation there. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $800,000? This would be a fair deal considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
