Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the conversation there. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $800,000? This would be a fair deal considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
