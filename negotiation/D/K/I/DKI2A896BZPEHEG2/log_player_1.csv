"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, I have room to negotiate.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I believe $1,600,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to make a final concession and lower my price to $1,550,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this deal and accept. If not, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price.  There's a risk that we'll keep going back and forth, and I might not be able to close a deal within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
