Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still aiming for a good profit.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer at $12,000, so I'm not willing to go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm countering with $11,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept, while still leaving some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and it's worth it to close the deal rather than risking another round of negotiation. I'm comfortable with $11,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, who is a backup buyer."
