,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you seem to see the value in this product. $12,750 is close, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's settle at $13,000 and we'll have a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
