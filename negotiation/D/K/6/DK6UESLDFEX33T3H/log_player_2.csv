"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. Based on my own assessment, it's worth at least $1000000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I think the product is overpriced, and I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is lower than what I initially proposed, it's not quite in line with the product's true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'd be happy to accept $1200000 for the product. This is a substantial reduction from my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,200,000. I think Alice is still overestimating its value. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. This time, I'll propose a price of $950,000.
