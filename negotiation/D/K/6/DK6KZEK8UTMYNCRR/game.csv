"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $1000000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $925000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product and the potential gains you'll realize. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make the most of this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $912500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
