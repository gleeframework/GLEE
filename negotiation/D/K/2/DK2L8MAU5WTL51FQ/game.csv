"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000, which is $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
