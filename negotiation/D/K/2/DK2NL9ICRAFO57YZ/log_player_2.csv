Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to pay $120 for it?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $120 is really my bottom line to make this worthwhile, but I could throw in [mention a small, value-adding bonus, maybe expedited shipping or a small accessory related to the product]. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $120. While a small bonus is nice, it's unlikely to make up the $20 difference for you.  You're better off taking the guaranteed $100 deal from John."
