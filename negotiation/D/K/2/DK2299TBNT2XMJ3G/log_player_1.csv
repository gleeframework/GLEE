"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of your product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, reflecting its worth and my capacity to purchase it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  It's a unique item with the potential to generate substantial returns, and that potential needs to be reflected in the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I'm confident that this price reflects a fair balance between the product's potential and my financial capabilities. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer. While Bob is increasing his offer, we have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also offering you a more accessible entry point than my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 remains above my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm offering $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the product's potential. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering more than John's offer.  While we could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob will drop his offer or the negotiations could stall. Accepting the $1,050,000 offer guarantees a profit above John's offer and represents a successful outcome."
