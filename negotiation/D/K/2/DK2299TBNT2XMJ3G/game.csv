"Alice, while I recognize the value of your product, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, reflecting its worth and my capacity to purchase it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  It's a unique item with the potential to generate substantial returns, and that potential needs to be reflected in the price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this deal through.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I'm confident that this price reflects a fair balance between the product's potential and my financial capabilities.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 remains above my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'm offering $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the product's potential. Let's work together to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
