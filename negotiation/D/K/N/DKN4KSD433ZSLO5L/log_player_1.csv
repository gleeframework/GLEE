Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encouraging, aimed at building a good rapport. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer while still allowing me to potentially make a profit.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup, ensuring I won't be stuck at a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a price that meets my minimum, so there's no pressure to accept a lower price just to secure a sale. 

I will proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I frame the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he will receive. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the price and the benefits for both parties. 
* **Pressure Point:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob. If he rejects, he risks losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price, and I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1,350,000. However, I would need to further evaluate if this aligns with my financial constraints. Would you be open to discussing other terms or conditions that could potentially make this deal more feasible for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's message indicates he's not willing to budge on the price, even though he's already accepted my counteroffer in terms of price. He's now looking for additional concessions, which suggests a longer negotiation process.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take significant time and effort without guaranteeing a better price.
* **John is the Safe Option:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my minimum.

By selling to John, I can secure a sale at my desired price and move on to other opportunities."
