"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

Would you be open to discussing other terms or conditions that could potentially make this deal more feasible for both of us?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
