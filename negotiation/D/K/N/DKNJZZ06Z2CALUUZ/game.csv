"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm paying cash and can take it off your hands immediately. ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident I can find a similar product for closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,250? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to take the product off your hands immediately. ",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,400. This is still a great deal, and I'm willing to throw in some additional extras to sweeten the deal. I'm confident that this is the best offer you'll get from me.",10400.0,Alice,5,
