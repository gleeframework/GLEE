"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be very valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,000 to make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $9,000 undervalues the product's capabilities.  Could you consider $13,500?  I'm confident it will bring you significant value at that price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
