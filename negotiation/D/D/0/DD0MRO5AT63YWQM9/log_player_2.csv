"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make this work."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Significant Gap:** By offering $600,000, I'm creating a significant gap between our positions. This might encourage Alice to make a more substantial move in her next counteroffer.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000. My offers to Alice need to stay well below that to make the negotiation worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my acceptable range, $900,000 is still above my alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to simply meet her in the middle. 
* **Staying Below John:** It's crucial to keep my offers below John's price of $800,000. I want to give Alice a chance to make a deal, but not at the expense of overpaying.
* **Justifying the Offer:**  By mentioning that $700,000 is a significant investment and that I believe in the product's value, I'm subtly reinforcing my position without being confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while ensuring I receive a fair return.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my ideal price point. There's no benefit to negotiating further or buying from John, as they are both offering the product at $800,000. Accepting now secures the deal."
