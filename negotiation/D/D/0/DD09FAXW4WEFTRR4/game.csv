"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm still very interested in the product, but I have to make a profit on the sale.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 one last time. I believe this is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.  Let me know your final decision.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
