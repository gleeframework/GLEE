Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high initially to see if Bob is willing to pay close to your valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $950,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Highlight Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position."
