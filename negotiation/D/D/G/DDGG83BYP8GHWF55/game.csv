"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
