"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
