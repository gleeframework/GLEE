"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You'll need to counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in buying, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $12,000.  Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save $2,000."
