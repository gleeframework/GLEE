"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. A counteroffer of $10,000 is still a good price for Bob, while leaving room for potential further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good price for Bob. It's lower than John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation will not lead to a significantly lower price. It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
