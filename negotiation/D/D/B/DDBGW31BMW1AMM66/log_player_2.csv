"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he should try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the initial price, I'm aiming for a bit lower to ensure a win-win scenario for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting the value I've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both sides."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering your initial offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $850,000.  While a little more negotiation could be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob potentially having to buy from John at $1,200,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly better price. Accepting the offer at $875,000 still saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
