Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go below $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $715,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm but fair.** She's not willing to go lower than $715,000, but it's a reasonable price considering your initial goal.
* **Time is a factor.** You've already had four rounds of negotiation, and the longer it drags on, the more likely it is that you'll either have to settle for a higher price or buy from John.
* **Potential for a slight increase later.** If you accept this offer, you can always try to negotiate a lower price for future purchases or services related to the product.

Accepting the offer at $715,000 allows you to acquire the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal or having to buy at a higher price from John."
