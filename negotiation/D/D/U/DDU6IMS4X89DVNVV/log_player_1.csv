"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to get for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This gives you a good price while allowing me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $8,750 is closer to what I need, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,750. How about we try $8,875? I'm getting close to my limit, and I'd like to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's getting closer, $8,875 is still too low for me. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,875 is just not a realistic price for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product.  How about $8,950?  That's a very small difference from your last offer and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,950. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,900. While it's not my ideal price, it's the closest we've come to an agreement and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away entirely.  It's better to secure a deal now than to risk losing him completely."
