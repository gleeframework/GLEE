Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a bit higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. It's still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to negotiate further.  I'll sell to John for $150, which is a safer bet than risking a lower offer from Bob."
