Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go above $950,000. How about we compromise at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to move, and there's a good chance we can push for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we meet at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for more, Bob's offer is now quite strong. Accepting $975,000 guarantees a significant profit without risking the deal falling through in later rounds. It's better to secure a very good deal than gamble on a potentially slightly better one."
