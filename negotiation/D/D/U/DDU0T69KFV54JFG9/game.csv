"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. Could we agree on a price of $17,000? I'm willing to be a bit flexible if we can reach a deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for being open to negotiation. I'm motivated to make a deal, so I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer.  It's a very fair price, and I need to be sure this is worthwhile for me. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
