"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum value of $12,000. 

It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, so a high starting offer is a good way to gauge his interest and potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and attempt to counter.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to try and negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000.  This is a further concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and we are now in round 6.  Since this is a good deal for me, I'll accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for a lower profit."
