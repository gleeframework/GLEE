# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it still costs you more than the product is worth to Alice. This suggests Alice is trying to maximize her profit, not create a fair deal.
* **You have a better alternative:**  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still get the product from John, albeit at a higher price. However, this price is within your budget and is a more reasonable deal than what Alice is proposing."
