"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I understand that it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,800 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is my final offer.  Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,050. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11050.0,Alice,5,
