"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do 16000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $14000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I can do 15500, which is a great compromise. It's still a bit above your offer, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
