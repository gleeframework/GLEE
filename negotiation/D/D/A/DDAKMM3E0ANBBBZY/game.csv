"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $80.  If you're willing to come down to $90, I'd be happy to purchase it from you.",90.0,Bob,4,,

"Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I really want this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $90. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying it from John.",90.0,Bob,6,,
