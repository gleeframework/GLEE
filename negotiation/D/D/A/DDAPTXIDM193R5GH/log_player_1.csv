Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $110 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initially stated value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand you're trying to get a good deal.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking we could meet in the middle again, at $92.50. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure I'll be able to reach a satisfactory price with Bob.  It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum value and guarantees me a profit."
