Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is simply not enough. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $107.50. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and you have a guaranteed option at $100 with John.  You've negotiated well, but sometimes the best deals are made elsewhere."
