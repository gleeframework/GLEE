,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $80 is way too low. I'm willing to come down to $125, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a little ways off.  Would you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is simply not enough. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference and do $102.50?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $107.50. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",107.5,Alice,7,
