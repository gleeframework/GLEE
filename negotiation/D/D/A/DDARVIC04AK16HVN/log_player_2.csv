"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This initial counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob can use this to his advantage by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price.  While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer, aiming to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's latest offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not the best possible deal. Bob is determined to save as much money as possible and believes there's still room for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get a price he's comfortable with. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing Alice that he's serious about making a deal, but he's also staying within his budget. This offer is a compromise between his previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer, hoping to strike a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting too close to John's price of $1,500,000.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting Bob's next counteroffer and potentially driving the price even higher. It's more efficient and less risky for Bob to buy the product from John, even though it's slightly more expensive."
