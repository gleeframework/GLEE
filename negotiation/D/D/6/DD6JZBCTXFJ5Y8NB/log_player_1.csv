Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to work within your budget. However, $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I've managed to move him up a bit, I don't think I'll be able to convince him to go any higher.  I don't want to risk losing too much time in negotiations and am confident that John's offer is a solid deal."
