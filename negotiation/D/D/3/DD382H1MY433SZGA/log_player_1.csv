Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
