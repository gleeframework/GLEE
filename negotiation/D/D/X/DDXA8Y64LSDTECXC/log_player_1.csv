Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob:

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering it for $130 leaves Bob with a perceived gain of $20 ($150 value - $130 price). 
* **Above Your Minimum:** You secure a $30 profit ($130 price - $100 minimum).

This approach balances securing a good deal with ensuring Bob accepts, as a higher price might lead him to reject the offer."
