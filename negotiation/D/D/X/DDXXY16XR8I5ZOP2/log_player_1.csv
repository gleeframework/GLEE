Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is $900,000, which is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he's willing to pay $900,000, I'll increase my price slightly to $920,000. This should give me a bit more room to negotiate.
