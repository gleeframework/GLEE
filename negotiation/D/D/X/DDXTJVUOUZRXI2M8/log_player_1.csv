Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit if he's really interested.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no need to go below that price with Bob."
