Let's analyze:

* **Bob's progress:** He's consistently increasing his offer, indicating genuine interest.
* **My position:** I've presented a strong front with John as leverage.
* **Rounds left:**  Only three rounds left, limiting further negotiation.

Bob's latest offer is tempting, but I think I can push him a little further.
