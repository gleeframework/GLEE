"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $950,000 is too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to make a significant move to show my commitment to this deal.

"Bob, I've been flexible, but we're still too far apart.  I have another interested buyer, and to be honest, your most recent offer isn't tempting enough for me to pass that up.  I'll consider selling for $1,175,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
