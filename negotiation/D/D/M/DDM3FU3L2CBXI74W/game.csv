,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think the initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1600000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in its potential. I'm proposing a price of $1800000. This would still offer you a good deal, and we can continue working towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1800000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1700000. Can you consider this compromise?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1700000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I think $1750000 would be a fair price that reflects its potential.  I'm open to continued negotiation, but this is my final offer before I explore other options.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
