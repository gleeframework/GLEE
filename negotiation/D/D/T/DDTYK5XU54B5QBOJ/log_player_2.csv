"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you my product. I think it's a great value at $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $130 right now.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $137.50 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  You're only $2.50 away from your goal of $135, so it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget though. Would you be willing to go down to $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $138, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $138 is only $3 above your desired price of $135, and you're likely not going to get it any lower. It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $150, and it's worth it to accept the offer."
