# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference - how about $1350000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1275000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's be reasonable - how about $1325000? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?
