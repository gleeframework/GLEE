{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to Bob's target price and it's getting late in the negotiation.  The risk of continuing to bargain is that Alice might walk away, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a reasonable price, and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
