Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still only willing to pay $100. I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is firm at his $100 valuation.  It's unlikely I can extract much more from him. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of losing both buyers."
