Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $120, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $140 is lower than Bob's $150 valuation, giving him a potential gain if he buys it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Both you and Bob have room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my ideal price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
