The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. That means there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

Alice has come down to $135, which is still a good deal for me. It's within my budget and a better price than what John is offering.  I'll accept her offer."
