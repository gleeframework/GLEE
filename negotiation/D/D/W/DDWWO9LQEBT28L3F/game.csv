"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $18000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll appreciate.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000. This is my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is this something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you in the middle at $10000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to stretch your budget to $9000. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $9500? I think it's a fair price that balances our interests.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $9500 is still a bit out of reach for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9250. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll be going with another seller.",9250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see that you're making a serious effort to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one final concession: how about we meet at $9750? It's a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9750.0,Alice,9,
