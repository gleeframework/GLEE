"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  My research indicates it's worth at least $1000000 to someone like you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $950000.  This is a significant discount and I believe it represents a tremendous opportunity for you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still higher than the product's worth to you.** You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000. This means you can still save money by rejecting the offer.
* **You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice.** By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. Alice may be willing to lower her price to secure the sale."
