"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth more to you than me. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $14000 for the product. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've mentioned the product holds for you, while also ensuring I get a decent return on my investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget, while still giving you a good return on your investment.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $16000 for the product. This is a fair price that should be more in line with what I'm looking for.",16000.0,Alice,5,
