"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by not stating this is my final price. 
* **Protecting My Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm in a good position if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still showing interest, which means there's potential for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Exploring Counteroffers:**  I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to see if I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:** While selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm hoping to secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $9,800 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer ($9,800) and my previous offer ($11,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm still leaving room for negotiation by not declaring this as my final offer.  
* **Maintaining My Bottom Line:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not losing out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $9,500 is a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offers are not getting close enough to my desired price. 
* **Risk of Time Running Out:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I risk running out of time if I continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a Safer Option:**  Although I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a profit and protects me from further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your time and understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving on to other offers."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm declaring this my final offer to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's last offer ($9,500).
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price.
* **Time Running Out:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm setting a clear deadline to signal that I'm serious about moving on if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Protecting Minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'm not risking a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now halfway through the negotiation process, and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is only $300 higher than his previous offer, which indicates he is not willing to budge much.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 ensures a profit and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I would prefer to get a higher price, it's becoming clear that a deal with Bob is unlikely. Selling to John guarantees a good outcome and minimizes the risk of losing out on a profitable sale."
