Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how to approach this negotiation:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob refuses).
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 (The maximum he's willing to pay).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Technically, there's no ZOPA because your lowest acceptable price is higher than Bob's highest. However, you can still try to negotiate.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price, you have leverage. Your goal is to see if Bob will pay more than $1,500,000, even though he values it less. This relies on factors like Bob's urgency or potential emotional attachment to the product.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other interested parties.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start above both your reservation price and Bob's valuation.
* **Scarcity:** You imply there are other potential buyers, creating urgency. 
* **No Justification:**  You don't need to justify the price; let Bob counter if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob refuses, you have John.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  If Bob counters, be willing to negotiate slightly, but don't go below $1,500,000.
* **This is a single-shot negotiation.** You have one chance to make your offer to Bob.
