"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I think it's a bit pricey for my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'd like to bring the price down slightly. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting closer to my target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12500. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John. I'd be willing to meet you at $11000, but that's my absolute limit. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to walking away, Bob. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. It's the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,9,
