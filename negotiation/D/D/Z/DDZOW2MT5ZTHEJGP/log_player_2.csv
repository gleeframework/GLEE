"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000.  It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He has a $15,000 fallback option with John, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but not unreasonable. He's proposing a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals his seriousness and his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  I think that's a fair compromise given the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is still within his budget and has a better fallback option, so he can try to get an even lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and increases the chance of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit high at $8,750.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he's willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best price. He's moved closer to Alice's last offer, but he's emphasizing that he's still at his limit. This creates pressure on Alice to make a decision."
