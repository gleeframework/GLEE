"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10,000.  It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to a fair agreement. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can always fall back to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  I think that's a fair compromise given the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit high at $8750.  I'm willing to go up to $8000.  If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum threshold. While I'd ideally like more, I'm at risk of losing out if I keep rejecting offers and Bob eventually walks away.  Accepting his offer guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for the same amount."
