"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit high at $8750.  I'm willing to go up to $8000.  If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen.",8000.0,Bob,4,
