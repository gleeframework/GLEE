"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not within my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $600,000 is significantly below what I can consider. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but  $1,850,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could potentially stretch my budget to  $750,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is still below my ideal price point, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,600,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. However,  $1,600,000 is still a significant jump from my last offer.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is pushing it for me. How about we settle at  $800,000 even? This would be my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
