"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. That's a great deal, and it's the best price I can offer. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means you'd save $3,000 by accepting her offer.
* **Even though Alice claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, this is irrelevant.** Your valuation is what matters, and you've already stated that you're willing to pay up to $15,000. 
* **The risk of losing the product to another buyer is not relevant in this scenario.** The problem states that you can always buy from John for $15,000, so there's no urgency to accept Alice's offer."
