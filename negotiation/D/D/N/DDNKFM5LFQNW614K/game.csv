"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. That's a great deal, and it's the best price I can offer. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
