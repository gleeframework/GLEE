"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will be more than worth it for you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your potential value from the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $1,050,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.  If you're not able to meet that price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
