"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an exclusive opportunity to own this valuable item at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product to you (saying it's worth $100 when you've stated your maximum is $100). 
* Her offer of $95 is still above your budget and only slightly less than John's price. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down further. If not, you can always buy from John for $100."
