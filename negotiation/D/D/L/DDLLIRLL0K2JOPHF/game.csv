"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
