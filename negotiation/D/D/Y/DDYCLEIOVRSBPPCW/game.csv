"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120 to $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $105. It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to make it more worth my while. How about we do $107.50?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to buying from John at this point. $107.50 is still a bit too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $106.25? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",106.25,Bob,6,
