"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $1,400,000 is a respectable figure, I'm still confident in the higher value this product represents. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,650,000.  I think this fairly reflects its potential and provides a good return for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
