Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I've already been offered $1,500,000 from John.  I don't want to risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price. It's time to sell to John and secure my desired profit."
