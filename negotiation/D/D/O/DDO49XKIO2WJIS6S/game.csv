"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value you place on it, and allows me to achieve a strong return.  Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $700,000? This still allows you to gain a decent profit while keeping the transaction within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. It doesn't allow me to reach my target profit margin.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a middle ground,  what do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe there's room for a better compromise. How about we aim for $750,000? This would still provide you with a good return while keeping the transaction within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
