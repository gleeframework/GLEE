{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My starting offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still very fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. I'm not ready to accept his offer yet, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale to John. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
