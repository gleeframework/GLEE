,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $110? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I still think $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $108 for it, and that's my final offer.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
