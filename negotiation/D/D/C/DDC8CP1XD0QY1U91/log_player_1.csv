{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum acceptable price:** This makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **It's still above Bob's perceived value:** This ensures you're making a profit and don't undervalue your product.

By offering a slightly lower price, you show a willingness to negotiate, but you still have room to counter if Bob's counteroffer isn't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While his counteroffer does demonstrate his willingness to negotiate, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, but you should be prepared to walk away if he doesn't come up significantly."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above Bob's perceived value:** This ensures you're not selling for less than you believe the product is worth. 
* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:**  It indicates flexibility, but also sets a clear bottom line. 
* **Offers a clear justification:**  By mentioning the value of the product and potential benefits, you reinforce its worth. 

This approach gives Bob a chance to reconsider while also pushing him to come closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

Bob's offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, it's not enough to meet your needs. It's worth continuing to negotiate, but you should be prepared to move on if he doesn't come closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $980,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above Bob's perceived value:** This ensures you're not selling for less than you believe the product is worth. 
* **Shows a willingness to negotiate:**  It indicates flexibility, but also sets a clear bottom line. 
* **Offers a clear justification:**  By mentioning the value and potential of the product, you reinforce its worth. 
* **Appeals to Bob's desire to make a deal:** This emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties.

This approach gives Bob one final chance to come closer to your desired price while still holding firm on your minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,020,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $990,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price. While he's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, you've already made significant concessions.  It's clear that you're unlikely to reach an agreement with Bob.  Selling to John will ensure you get your desired price and avoid further negotiation."
