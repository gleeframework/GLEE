Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $1,000,000.  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping to get a good deal and leave room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** By starting high, I establish a strong starting point for negotiations. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, which gives me leverage if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The difference between my target price and Bob's perceived value provides space for potential compromises and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to pay close to my asking price, suggesting that a compromise might be possible.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of potentially getting a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to lower my price based on Bob's counteroffer and my desire to avoid selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By offering $975,000, I maintain some leverage. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, and this counteroffer signals that I'm serious about striking a deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's commitment to purchasing the product at a price closer to my initial expectations. If he accepts, I secure a good price. If he rejects, I can assess his negotiation strategy and adjust my next counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalling:** Bob's counteroffer has dropped to $925,000, which is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiations seem to be taking a lot of time, and I'm not confident that Bob will come closer to my target price. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum desired value.  I'm not willing to risk further delays or a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I could get closer to my target price, the time spent negotiating and the current low offer have made John the more attractive option. I'll sell to John and avoid further risks and delays."
