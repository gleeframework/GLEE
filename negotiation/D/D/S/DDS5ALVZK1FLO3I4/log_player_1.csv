Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $100 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not there yet. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering.  I'll take it!"
