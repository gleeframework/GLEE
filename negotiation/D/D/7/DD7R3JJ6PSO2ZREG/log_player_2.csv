"Alice's offer: The product price will be $799,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $799,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have a clear goal of saving money.  While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's, it's still a large amount. There's potential to negotiate further and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower price than Alice's offer signals your intent to negotiate seriously.  A significant drop demonstrates your willingness to walk away if needed.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** While $600,000 is a significant discount, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. This gives room for negotiation.

**Note:**  The success of this counteroffer depends on Alice's valuation of the product. If her value is closer to your offer, there's a good chance she'll counter back.  If her value is much higher, she's more likely to reject and potentially make a higher counteroffer herself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your target, but it's closer.  You still have the potential to negotiate a better price.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Further Discount:**  There's likely room to push for a lower price, especially as Alice has already conceded some ground.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  By rejecting this offer, you're not committing to a higher price. If the negotiations fall apart, you can still buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a more moderate increase from your previous offer, signaling that you're serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By offering $675,000, you're essentially meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($725,000) and your previous offer ($600,000). This demonstrates a willingness to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:** 

The success of this counteroffer will depend on Alice's valuation of the product.  If she values it close to your offer, she's more likely to accept. If her value is much higher, she may counter back with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is still a considerable amount, it's closer to your desired price range. Considering the following:

* **Negotiation Progress:** You've already lowered the price significantly from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of Going Higher:** Rejecting again could lead to a higher counteroffer from Alice, pushing the price closer to John's.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation could take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly better price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $750,000 is a good compromise. It secures the product at a decent price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price."
