"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let you have it for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you know Alice values the product at $80. There's a chance she might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
