Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $150. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum of $120 but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion, mentioning that the price is my initial assessment and hinting at potential negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  The friendly message invites Bob to counter, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Protect my minimum:** I'm comfortable walking away and selling to John for $120 if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's not even close to what the product is worth to me.  While I want to sell the product, it's important for me to secure a fair price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This price still allows for some profit for me while being more reasonable for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $105, which is halfway between my initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $60. This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is positive and encouraging further negotiation. It highlights that the counteroffer is a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Next Steps:** By proposing a compromise, I'm hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid the need to sell to John, which would result in a lower profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $105 is still a bit much for me.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, his offer of $75 is still below my acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to compromise my profit margin significantly. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  This would be a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $90, which is still above my minimum of $120 but closer to Bob's offer of $75. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing that this offer is a good compromise. I'm also highlighting that this price is beneficial for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider it. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be accepted by Bob. If he rejects it again, I might have to reconsider selling to John."
