"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's last offer.
* **Time is running out:**  With 10 rounds in total, accepting now means Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* **John's offer:**  While John offers the product for $15,000, Bob is saving $1,500 by accepting Alice's offer.

It's worth noting that Bob could try to counteroffer again, aiming for $13,250. However, the risk of Alice rejecting that offer and the time pressure make accepting her offer a more sensible choice."
