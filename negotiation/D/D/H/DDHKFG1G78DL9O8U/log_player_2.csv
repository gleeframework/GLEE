"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
