Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $150 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob to engage in discussion, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
