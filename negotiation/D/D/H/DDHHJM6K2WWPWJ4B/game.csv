"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is appealing, this product's value is significantly higher for its potential. Could we agree on $1,050,000?  I'm aiming for a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is close, but to make this work, I'd need a minimum of $1,000,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
