"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features and benefits. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This price is a good compromise for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm trying to be more flexible to reach a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"We're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied with this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $1,225,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, let's be realistic.  $1,225,000 is still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our respective needs. Let's seal this deal now.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price is a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm trying to reach a deal with you.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
