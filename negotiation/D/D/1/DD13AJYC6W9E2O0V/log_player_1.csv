Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that holds immense value for both of us. I know it's worth a million dollars to you, and frankly, it's worth at least that to me. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the mutual benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position. It makes sense to aim high with Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** By asking for $1,250,000, you're aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the value to both parties, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  While the price is ambitious, the tone remains professional and avoids appearing greedy.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay above the product's value to him.
* **Negotiation Possibility:**  This offer might lead to negotiation, and you might need to be prepared to lower your price slightly.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John."
