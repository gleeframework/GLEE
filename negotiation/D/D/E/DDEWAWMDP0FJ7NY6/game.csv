"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $115.  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $112.50.  How about we split the difference and settle on $113.75? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",113.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $113.75. How about $111.875?",111.875,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you at $111.88. Let's seal the deal.",111.88,Alice,7,

"I'm close, but I still think we can do better. How about $110.90?",110.9,Bob,8,
