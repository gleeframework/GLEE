"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for the same price ($120) from John, so there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $100?  That's still a great deal for you, as you value it at $120.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'm willing to consider your offer and am now proposing $105 as the product price. This is a middle ground between our previous offers and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and at $105, the product is now cheaper than buying it from John. It's a good deal for you, so accepting is the best choice."
