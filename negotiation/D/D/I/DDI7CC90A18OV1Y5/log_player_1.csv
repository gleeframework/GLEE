Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could lead to greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) might make him suspicious.  A price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly."
