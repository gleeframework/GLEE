Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $78? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay under $80.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's clear he's unwilling to go above $80.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for a potential $2 gain.  I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John."
