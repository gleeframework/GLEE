Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and Bob's perceived worth ($8,000). This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same amount I would get from John. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
