Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to close the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I've already told you that I need to make a profit of at least $200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not interested in selling it to John for less than I can get from you.
