"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can always buy it from John for the same price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to close the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I've already told you that I need to make a profit of at least $200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not interested in selling it to John for less than I can get from you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
