{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price of $800,000. You can always switch to John if you don't think you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're showing flexibility by increasing your offer from $800,000 to $900,000. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range for you.  This is a good middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has dropped her price to $1,050,000, which is still higher than your ideal price but significantly closer to your maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and you risk losing the opportunity to purchase from Alice altogether. Accepting her offer allows you to secure the product while staying within a manageable price range.  While you'd prefer to pay less, it's a reasonable compromise, considering the alternative of buying from John at $800,000."
