{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for something worth so much to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a little higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, you can still get a good price by counter-offering or by selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $9,500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair considering it's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on getting at least $10,500 for this product. It's a fair compromise considering it's worth $10,000 to you, and I know you're serious about acquiring it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm still confident this product is worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and it's likely he won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer will ensure I get a good price, and avoid the risk of him backing out or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
