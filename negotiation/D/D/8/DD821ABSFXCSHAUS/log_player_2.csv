It's not a good deal for Bob to pay $11,000 when he's only willing to spend $10,000.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price from Alice."

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on getting at least $10,500 for this product. It's a fair compromise considering it's worth $10,000 to you, and I know you're serious about acquiring it.  What do you think?

Bob is still trying to save money, and $10,500 is more than he is willing to pay. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
