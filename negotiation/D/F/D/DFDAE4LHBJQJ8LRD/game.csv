"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $775,000?  This would be a fair compromise between our two positions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
