"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is quite high.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I could do  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding the value of this product. While your offer is quite low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  To be realistic, I think $1,250,000 is a fair offer.  It acknowledges the value of the product while working within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to get for this product. With that in mind, how about we make this our final price: $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my part and a fair price for this unique product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  To be frank, anything over $1,300,000 would be pushing my limits. Would you be willing to consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
