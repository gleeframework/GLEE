You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price."
