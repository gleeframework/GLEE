Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, and it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John. I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate up from his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I will try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200} 
```

I'm moving a little closer to Bob's offer but I'm still holding firm on a price higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not convinced I can get a better deal. I'm comfortable with the price I can get from John, so I'll sell to him."
