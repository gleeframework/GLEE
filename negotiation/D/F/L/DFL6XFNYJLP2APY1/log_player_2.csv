Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down, the price is still above my target. I want to see if I can push her lower with another counteroffer. There are still several rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within my budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. While I'd prefer a lower price,  it's getting close to my target, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
