"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing Bob values it at $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting Bob's potential gain by mentioning the product's worth to him.
* **Open Ended:**  The ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Maximum Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, and $90 is still below that.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have the upper hand in this negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested and has already lowered his price. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 feels like a fair price given the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my target price but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to justify the price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  While I'm not accepting $90, I'm showing willingness to negotiate and compromise."
