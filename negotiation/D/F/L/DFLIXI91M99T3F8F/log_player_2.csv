"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for less. It's worth rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still a good deal for Alice (above her value of $80) but also gives him a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 feels like a fair price given the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum value is $120.  He has already made a counteroffer and might risk further negotiation pushing Alice away. Accepting at this point is a good strategy for Bob."
