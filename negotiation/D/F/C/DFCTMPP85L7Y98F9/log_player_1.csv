Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $19,000, Alice can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he flat-out rejects this price, it might mean he's unwilling to go much higher than his perceived value ($8,000).  
* **Fallback Option:** Alice has a secure fallback option with John, who's ready to pay $15,000. This allows her to be firmer in her negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While Alice knows Bob's perceived value, she needs to be mindful of not completely alienating him with an unreasonably high price.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer is just the start. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob, potentially lowering the price slightly to reach an agreement."
