Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than both my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer. I have room to negotiate and will try to meet Bob somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still above reserve:** The price remains comfortably above my $1,000,000 reserve and John's offer.
* **Strong message:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I am still working within my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and it's higher than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain doesn't outweigh the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit."
