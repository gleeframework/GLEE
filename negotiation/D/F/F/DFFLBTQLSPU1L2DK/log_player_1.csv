Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $100.  While $120 from John is my fallback, I'm going to see if I can close the deal with Bob for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my asking price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this product.  Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $118 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Bob is clearly not going to go much higher, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  John is a reliable buyer, and $120 is a good price that meets my minimum requirement."
