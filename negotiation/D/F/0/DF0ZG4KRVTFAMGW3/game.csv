"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I believe this price is fair, taking into account both our individual valuations. However, I am confident I can find another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 if you choose not to accept this offer.  Please let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
