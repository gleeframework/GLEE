"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I believe this price is fair, taking into account both our individual valuations. However, I am confident I can find another buyer willing to pay $1,200,000 if you choose not to accept this offer.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You have a better alternative with John, guaranteeing you stay within your budget."
