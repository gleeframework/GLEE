"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth $100 for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice values the product at $80. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $90.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate further. How about considering a price of $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for a better deal. You can still save a few more dollars by making a counteroffer. It's not worth buying from John yet, as you're getting closer to a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $92? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $93 for the product. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $93 is very close to your ideal price of $92. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's well within your budget and represents a good compromise."
