"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $102.50. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",102.5,Alice,5,
