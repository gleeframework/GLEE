"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than John's price of $10,000.
* **It's within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to spend up to $10,000, so $9,500 is acceptable.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $500."
