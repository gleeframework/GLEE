Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.  What do you think?

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate further."

I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice is unwilling to go any lower than $11,250, which is still over your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
