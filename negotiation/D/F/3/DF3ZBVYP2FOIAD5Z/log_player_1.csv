{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit and haven't given away too much.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for negotiation and potentially finding a price that works for both of you. 

I'll keep the option of selling to John for $12,000 in mind in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both be happy with this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value of $12,000 and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. Accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
