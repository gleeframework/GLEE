While Alice's offer is lower, it's still a bit higher than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your target of $1,200,000."

Alice has made her final offer, and while it's lower than her initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,200,000, it's the most financially prudent decision to purchase from John."
