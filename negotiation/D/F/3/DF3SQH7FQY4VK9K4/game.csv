"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet halfway on this.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise.  It's a fair price considering the value to you and the value I'm placing on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
