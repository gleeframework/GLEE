"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round. Selling to John now would secure me my minimum, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet halfway on this."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or secure the deal with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise.  It's a fair price considering the value to you and the value I'm placing on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my minimum price, but Bob is still unwilling to budge significantly. With only four rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  Selling to John now guarantees me my desired $1,500,000, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra thousand dollars."
