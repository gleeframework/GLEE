Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for you considering your value for the product. Let's meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $875,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering I have a backup buyer in John. It's time to close this deal."
