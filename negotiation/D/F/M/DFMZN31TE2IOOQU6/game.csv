"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you.  My initial offer is $1,750,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. This price is still a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
