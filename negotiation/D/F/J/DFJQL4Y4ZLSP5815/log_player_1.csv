Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
