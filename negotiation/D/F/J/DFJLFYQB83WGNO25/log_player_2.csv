Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a stretch for me, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the value I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000. She rejected your best offer of $8,000, and her latest counter-offer is still significantly higher. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
