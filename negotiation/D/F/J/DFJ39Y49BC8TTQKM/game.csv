"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  To move this forward, I can drop the price to $17,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,500?  This feels like a reasonable point for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
