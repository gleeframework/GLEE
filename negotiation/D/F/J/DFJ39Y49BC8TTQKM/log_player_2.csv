"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $20,000 is far beyond his budget.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your budget constraints.  To move this forward, I can drop the price to $17,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $17,000 is still above Bob's desired budget of $10,000. While Bob is interested in the product, he wants to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a price that works for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,500?  This feels like a reasonable point for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $14,500 is still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price without closing the deal prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
