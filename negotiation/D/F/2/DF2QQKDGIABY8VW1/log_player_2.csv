"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $150 is far above his maximum budget of $100. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob starts by offering significantly less than Alice's initial price, aiming to establish a lower starting point for negotiations.
* **Message:**  Bob politely states his reason for rejecting the offer and provides a clear counteroffer price. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Price:**  $80 is a reasonable starting point, still within Bob's budget but leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $120 for the product. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to attempt to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob continues to inch closer to his desired price, but still leaving room for a potential final compromise.
* **Message:**  Bob highlights the compromise aspect of his offer, making it seem more appealing to Alice.
* **Price:** $95 is a significant step towards Bob's $100 budget limit, but leaves room for a possible counter-offer from Alice."
