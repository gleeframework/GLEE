Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, my goal is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring a substantial profit for me.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value and proposes a price just below my guaranteed sale price, creating a sense of urgency and potential for a good deal for Bob."
