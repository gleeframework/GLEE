"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still think this product is worth more than $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $155. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
