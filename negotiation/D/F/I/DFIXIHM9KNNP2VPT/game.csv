"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, with its potential for [mention a key benefit or two], sits at a higher point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from this acquisition.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
