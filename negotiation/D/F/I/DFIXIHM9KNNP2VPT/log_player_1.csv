I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,200,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, with its potential for [mention a key benefit or two], sits at a higher point.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the product's potential benefits, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a strong strategic move at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** It's $400,000 above Bob's perceived value and a healthy profit margin for me. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties of further negotiation.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a chance Bob could walk away, and John's offer, while secure, is less profitable."
