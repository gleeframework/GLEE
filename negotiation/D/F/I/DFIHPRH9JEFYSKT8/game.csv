"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it.  This offer reflects a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits it offers. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still benefits me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you consider $7,000? This would be a fair deal considering my budget limitations. ",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
