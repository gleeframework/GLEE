# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

This is a compromise that still benefits me, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

It's not worth trying to haggle Alice down any further. She's unlikely to go below $8,000, and even if she did, the savings would be minimal. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best option at this point."
