"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your collection. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10750.
