"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your collection. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it looks great, $11500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10500? I'm serious about purchasing it and believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a little higher than my ideal price. I'm ready to close the deal today at $10750. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to earn a profit while staying within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a deal at $11200. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However, $11200 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at $11000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied, you with a good profit and me with a great product within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
