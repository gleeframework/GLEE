"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no need to risk negotiation.  You're guaranteed the same price with John, so there's no potential for saving money by negotiating with Alice."
