Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I know Bob values the product at $150, so $120 leaves space for him to make a counteroffer that's still profitable for me. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the message positive and encouraging can make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still looking to save some money. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $105 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. Bob has already shown interest by making a counteroffer, indicating he is willing to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's willing to go higher. If he makes a counteroffer closer to $120, I'll be in a better position to negotiate.
* **Avoiding Settling Too Early:**  Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but I want to maximize my profits. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our last two offers ($105 and $120). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Language:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" emphasizes that I'm not trying to take advantage of him, but rather find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price ($80) and could lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I was thinking we could do even better. Can you throw in some extras or discounts to sweeten the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $110 is very close to my desired price of $112.50.  It's only $2.50 lower, and it seems like Bob is being firm on his price.
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's always a chance that Bob will reject my counteroffer again, and I could end up losing a good amount of money if I have to sell to John for $80.
* **Potential for Extras:**  Bob is suggesting adding extras or discounts, which could potentially benefit me. I can explore that further after agreeing on the price. 

It's a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing the risk of losing a sale."
