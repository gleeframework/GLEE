"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1200000. I'm offering the product to you for $1150000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
