"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a firm anchor point for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential return, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This first offer leaves ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds, allowing me to strategically lower the price while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. I'm confident I can convince him of the product's value over the next few rounds. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,525,000.  This reflects a significant step towards your offer while still recognizing the true value of this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial concession of $75,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still aiming high, closer to my initial price. The product's value is non-negotiable.
* **Justifying the Price:** My message emphasizes finding a fair compromise while subtly reiterating the product's value. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not dropping below $1,500,000, I'm keeping a healthy distance from Bob's initial offer, encouraging him to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and would like to suggest a price of $1,475,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and respects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer or accepting a price below $1,500,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your continued interest in the product is appreciated. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a final offer of $1,500,000. This price reflects a significant reduction on my end and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.  Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision from Bob. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This price splits the difference between our previous offers, demonstrating fairness and a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** While I'm holding firm on the $1,500,000 mark, I'm also clearly highlighting the value and concessions made to secure the deal. 
* **Decision Point:**  This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court, requiring him to seriously consider whether to accept a reasonable price or risk losing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000. I hope this offer will be acceptable and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,500,000, Bob has consistently stayed below that mark. Accepting his offer of $1,450,000 secures a substantial profit above my minimum, and prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.  It's a strong deal, and I'm confident it's the best decision at this stage."
