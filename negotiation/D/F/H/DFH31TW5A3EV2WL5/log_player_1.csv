Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $11000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.
