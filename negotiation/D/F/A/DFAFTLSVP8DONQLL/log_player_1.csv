Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly not going to budge significantly from his offer.  We've almost reached the halfway point of the negotiations, and he's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is better than risking Bob walking away or continuing to lowball. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
