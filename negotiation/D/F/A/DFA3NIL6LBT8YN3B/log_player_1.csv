Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's significantly below his $1,200,000 valuation) while maximizing your profit above your $800,000 minimum.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1,000,000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's friendly, acknowledges the product's value to Bob, and positions the price as mutually beneficial.
* **The Price:** $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. Here's why:
    * **For Bob:** He saves $200,000 compared to his valuation.
    * **For You:** You make a $200,000 profit above your minimum. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $800,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Having John as a backup strengthens your position. Bob knows you have other options."
