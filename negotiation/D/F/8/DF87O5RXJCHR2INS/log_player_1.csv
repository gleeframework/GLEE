Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still leaving room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point and allow for a possible win-win scenario.  I'll keep an eye on the rounds and consider selling to John if negotiations don't seem to be going my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. I am willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm holding out for a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find some common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is not budging from his offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to considering selling to John if this round doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $14,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still trying to get the best price from Bob. This is my final offer, and I'll seriously consider selling to John if it's rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I would like to counter with $13,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if that's rejected, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off on the price. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This is a compromise offer, trying to bridge the gap between my previous offer and Bob's.  I'm hoping to get close enough to Bob's valuation that he'll accept, but if not, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to stick to my previous proposal of $13,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are unlikely to yield a price that is significantly better than John's offer. I've made multiple counteroffers and Bob isn't willing to budge further. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
