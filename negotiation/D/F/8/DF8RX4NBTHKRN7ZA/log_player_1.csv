Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). It's unlikely he'll agree to a price close to our desired amount. We need to show firmness and potentially nudge him towards accepting a smaller concession on his end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product. To be frank, $1,400,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We're sending a clear signal that we're reaching our limit. Using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""bottom line"" emphasizes this.
* **Smaller Concession:** We are only reducing our price by $100,000 this round, signaling that we're not willing to move much further. 
* **Pressure:**  By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we're putting a bit of pressure on Bob to make a decision.  

This strategy aims to either secure a price closer to our desired range or encourage Bob to reveal how much he's truly willing to pay."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,550,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still significantly undercutting the product's value to both you and what John is offering. It's clear he's trying to get a bargain. By continuing to reject his offers, we maintain a firm negotiating position. We're still in a position to get a better price, either from Bob in the next round or by accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're reaching a point where our valuations are simply too far apart.  I'm willing to consider $1,450,000, but this is absolutely my bottom line. I have another interested buyer, and I need to make a decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're reiterating that this is our absolute bottom line, making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Competition:** Introducing the idea of another buyer adds a sense of urgency and reminds Bob that he's not the only option.
* **Limited Time:**  Stating that we need to ""make a decision soon"" further emphasizes the time constraint.

This strategy aims to either secure a final agreement or encourage Bob to walk away, at which point we can move on to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and unwilling to meet us even near our lowest acceptable price. We've been firm, introduced competition, and given him ample opportunity to negotiate in good faith. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
