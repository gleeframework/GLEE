"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. He has a fallback option of buying from John for $8,000, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers.  He's already very close to his desired price point of $8,000 by buying from John. While $9,000 is better than $9,500, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  By rejecting, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $8,900. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,900 is a good price, Bob has reached the point where he's very close to his goal.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, making it the most logical choice at this point.  There's no guarantee Alice will lower her price further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from John."
