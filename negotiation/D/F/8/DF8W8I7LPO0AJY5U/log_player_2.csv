I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand the value of the product.

It seems Alice is not willing to budge closer to my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  I can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000, which is the top of my budget."
