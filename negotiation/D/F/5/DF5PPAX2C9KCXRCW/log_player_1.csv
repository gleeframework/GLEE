"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This will test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $14,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a little more, given his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to John's offer, I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob. I'm not sure how much more he's willing to pay, but I'm willing to risk it for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm making a final concession, bringing the price down to $12,500. This is still significantly higher than John's offer and leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John. Bob's offer is getting too close to John's, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee a profit."
