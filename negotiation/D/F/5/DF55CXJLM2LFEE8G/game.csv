"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves you with a great deal, considering the product's true worth. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $975,000.  This leaves us both with a fair deal and a successful outcome.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
