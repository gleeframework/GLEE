Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a safer option than risking further negotiation."
