"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we start at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting significantly lower gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  I acknowledge Alice's offer while making it clear I'm looking for a significantly lower price.
* **Strategic Consideration:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the John option ($100). My counteroffers need to keep me below that price or close enough to make the negotiation with Alice worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $120 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above what John is offering. I have room to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, I have a budget of $100 for this kind of product. Could you meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** I'm setting a firm anchor at my maximum budget ($100).  This signals to Alice that I'm serious about not exceeding this limit.
* **Transparency:** By being transparent about my budget, I'm hoping to gain Alice's trust and encourage her to be more realistic in her offers.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Putting my ideal price on the table now adds a bit of time pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to sell at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, let's try $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** Alice has signaled this is likely her final offer by stating she's only willing to make ""one more concession."" 
* **Minimal Savings Loss:** Accepting $110 is only $10 more than my alternative option (John). It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significant improvement.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation has a cost in terms of time. Accepting now secures the product without the risk of Alice backing out or the price increasing."
