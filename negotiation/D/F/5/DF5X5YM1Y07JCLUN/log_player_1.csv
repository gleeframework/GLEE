{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from my minimum price:** This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By not going too low, it allows me to potentially negotiate upwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a strong starting point:** It shows I am serious about selling to Bob but also that I'm not desperate.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with my own offer, keeping in mind the value to me ($1,000,000) and John's offer as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,000,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $900,000.  I am not desperate for a quick sale, and I believe I can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer. I need to find a price that is still attractive to Bob while ensuring I don't lose too much profit.  I will keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is still a significant saving for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $850,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer of $900,000. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:** I highlight that this price is still a significant saving for him, emphasizing his potential gains.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer keeps me above my minimum price of $1,000,000 and allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters again.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess the situation carefully.  I can either make another counteroffer or, if his next counteroffer is significantly lower, I might choose to accept it and move on, or I can sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. Can you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is right at the edge of what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original price, I'm considering the following:

* **Bob's persistence:** He's clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for future business:**  A successful sale now could lead to future opportunities with Bob.
* **John's offer:** While $1,000,000 is appealing, there's no guarantee of a future relationship with John.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and potentially opening a door for future collaborations. This is a calculated risk, but one I'm willing to take to potentially build a long-term partnership."
