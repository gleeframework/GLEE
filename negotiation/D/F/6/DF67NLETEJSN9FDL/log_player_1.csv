Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum selling price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is also lower than what Bob values the product at, giving him a potential benefit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can still potentially increase the price without losing the deal. 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other offers or strategies!"
