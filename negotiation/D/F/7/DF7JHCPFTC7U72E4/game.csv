"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80? I think that's a fair price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $120.  This still gives you a great price, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,4,
