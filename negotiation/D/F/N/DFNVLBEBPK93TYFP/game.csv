"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a substantial profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well below my original asking price and allows you to make a good profit.  Let's make a deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
