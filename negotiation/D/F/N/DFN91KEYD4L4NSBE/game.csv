"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $11,000, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're coming up a bit, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference?  $10,150.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's make it happen!",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to making this deal work. Let's make this our last offer. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is my final price. I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
