Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $11,000, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up a bit, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference?  $10,150.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do $9,900. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with the price. It's time to make one more counteroffer and see if we can finally reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to consider selling to John."

This is getting frustrating. We're very close to a deal, but Bob is still too far off. I've made several concessions and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing more time than I'm gaining. I'm going to sell the product to John.  He's willing to pay my asking price and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
