"I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount for you, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,
