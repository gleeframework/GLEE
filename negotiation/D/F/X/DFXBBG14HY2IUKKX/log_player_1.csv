Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also showing I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves some room for a win-win situation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm not going to settle for that price right now. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I can't go lower than $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to compromise my minimum price. I'd rather sell the product to John for $15,000 and guarantee myself a profit."
