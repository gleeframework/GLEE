"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However,  $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I still get a fair price. How about $10,500?  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it will be worth it in the long run. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
