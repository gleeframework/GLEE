Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementing his offers too slowly. At this pace, it is unlikely he will reach a price that is acceptable to you (above $1,200,000) within the remaining rounds.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most financial sense to sell to him now."
