"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on this.  While I appreciate the product's value, I can't justify going above $700,000.  That's a firm offer from my side.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my minimum. This product is worth a significant investment, and $700,000 doesn't reflect that.  My final offer is $1,100,000.  This is a considerable reduction on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that we're getting closer, but that's still a big leap for me. I'm willing to stretch to $750,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
