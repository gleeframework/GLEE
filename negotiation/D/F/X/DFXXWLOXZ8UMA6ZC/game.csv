,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to let it go for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $95.  Let's try to find some common ground here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your interest but I need a price that works for me too.  $105 is my final offer, it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
