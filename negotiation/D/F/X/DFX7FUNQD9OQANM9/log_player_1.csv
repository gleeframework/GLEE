Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,100,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving him with a potential gain of $100,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price of $800,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
