"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit you greatly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
