"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $12,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
