"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific needs. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
