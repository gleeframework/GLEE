``` 

This offer gives Bob a good discount while still giving me a significant profit. I've left some room for negotiation to encourage him to counteroffer, which could potentially lead to a higher price. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,100,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us both to make a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am able to offer $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. John is still a viable option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,130,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Negotiations with Bob have gone on for a few rounds, and while he's willing to go up slightly, his offers are still well below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  John is offering me my full desired price, so it's time to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
