"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me a healthy profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves me a respectable profit while giving you a very good price. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal. Let's finalize this so we can both move on.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
