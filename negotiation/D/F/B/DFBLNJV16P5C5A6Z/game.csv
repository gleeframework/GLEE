"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too far below my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line. This is the price it's worth to me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
