"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $120, I propose a fair price of $110 for this exceptional product. We hope this aligns with your expectations and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'm interested in the product, but I'm a bit of a savvy shopper. I'd like to save some money if possible. Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $110. I'll reject Alice's offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.
