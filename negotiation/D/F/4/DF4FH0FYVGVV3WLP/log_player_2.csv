"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

I've decided to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below my $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my budget, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try countering a bit lower to see if Alice is willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you be open to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm incrementally increasing my offer to signal that I'm interested while still striving for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's a reasonable price compared to my $100 alternative. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
