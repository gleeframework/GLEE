Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for the product, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Bob's value:** He values it at $8,000, so there's room for compromise. 
* **Strategic offer:** $12,000 is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. If the negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial offer, $10,000 is still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, and there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, there's a risk of losing a potential buyer who may be willing to pay more.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is still well above Bob's offer of $10,000, but closer to the middle ground.
* **Maintain value:**  $11,000 is a price I'm comfortable with, as it's closer to my desired range than Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer creates pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing a potential deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my offer based on his actions. If he rejects, I may lower my price again, but I'll be mindful of my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit and removes the uncertainty of further negotiations. 
* **Risk of further concessions:** Accepting Bob's offer could lead to a pattern of continually lowering my price, potentially jeopardizing my profit margin. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects, I will strongly consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer.  
* **Compromise:** This price is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While this price is closer to my minimum, it's a gamble. If Bob rejects, selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option.

**Next Steps:**

* **Decision point:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll immediately contact John to finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low, and further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price close to my minimum. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is high. He's already rejected several offers, and continuing may lead to a drawn-out process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit and eliminates the uncertainty of continued negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately contact John to finalize the sale, ensuring I maximize my profit and avoid further delays or potential losses."
