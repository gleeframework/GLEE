"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12750 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $13500.",13500.0,Alice,5,
