"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95? That seems like a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be totally honest, $100 is the absolute most I can spend on this. If you're able to do that, I'm ready to buy right now. If not, I understand, but I might need to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to spend $100, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I've already come down a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's the last offer I'm willing to make, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,7,
