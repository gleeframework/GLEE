"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. To be completely transparent, $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. Can you consider this offer?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
