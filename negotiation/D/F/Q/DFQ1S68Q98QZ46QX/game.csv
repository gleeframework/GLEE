"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant, and $13,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet closer to my initial offer at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
