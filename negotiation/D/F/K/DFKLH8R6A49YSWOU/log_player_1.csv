"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm lowering my price to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This should encourage Bob to consider a higher price, while still leaving me with a profit margin above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm sticking with $9,000 for this round. Since Bob's previous offer was $8,500, I'm hoping this demonstrates my firm stance while keeping the negotiation moving forward."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for $9,000. I have 4 rounds left, and there's still a chance he'll budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}

With only 3 rounds left, I'm dropping my price to $8,900. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping this will push Bob towards accepting."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $8,800. We are now only two rounds from the end of the negotiation, and while I would prefer $9,000, I think it's a good compromise and a successful outcome for me, as it is above my minimum price of $8,000."
