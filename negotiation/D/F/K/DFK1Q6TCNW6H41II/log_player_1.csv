"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value and potential of the product, even though I don't know its true value to Bob. This might make him consider the price more favorably. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or cutting my losses and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Test Bob's Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how motivated Bob is to buy the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counteroffer again, and I can then adjust my strategy.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price that is more appealing to me but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Given the unique capabilities of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial partnership.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still protecting my interests.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to emphasize the product's value, aiming to justify the price.
* **Partnership Framing:**  I'm using language like ""mutually beneficial partnership"" to create a sense of collaboration and encourage a positive response from Bob.

**Strategy:** By lowering my price, I'm increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects again, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I'm still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my target price and well above my minimum of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting late in the game.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal with him and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most prudent decision. It secures a sale at a very favorable price, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
