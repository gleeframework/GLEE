Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product to your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the costs and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.
