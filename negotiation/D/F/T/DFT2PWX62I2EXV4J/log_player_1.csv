Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be of immense value to your company. My asking price is $1,150,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to gain a competitive edge, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in this investment. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product to your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting and closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the costs and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have costs and potential to consider, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $1,000,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've been negotiating for several rounds now, and I don't see a strong possibility of him increasing his offer.  John's offer provides me with my minimum profit, so I will accept his offer and sell the product to him."
