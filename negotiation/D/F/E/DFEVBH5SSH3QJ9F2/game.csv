"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your perspective. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.  Would you be open to discussing this further?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This represents a significant movement on my part and recognizes the value you see in the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
