{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has great potential for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects its inherent worth and allows for a substantial profit margin for you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  It sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep Bob engaged and interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  I believe the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but it's still below the value I believe this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This allows for a significant profit for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Strategy:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility while also pushing for a better deal.
* **Justification:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that my counteroffer is a win-win for both of us.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is just $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future business opportunities.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away entirely, and I might have to sell to John at a lower price.

Therefore, it's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer at this point."
