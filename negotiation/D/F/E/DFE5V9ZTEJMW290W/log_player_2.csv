"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I can hold onto it, so I'd love to hear back from you soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, Alice's message uses classic sales tactics to create urgency. There's a good chance you can get a better price by negotiating or waiting for her to potentially lower the offer.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
