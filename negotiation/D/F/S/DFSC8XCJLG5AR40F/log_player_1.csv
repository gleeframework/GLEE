Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John.
* **Potential upside:** I'm aiming for a higher profit, so I'm offering the product for $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob is genuinely interested but doesn't want to pay the full amount.
* **Risk:** The risk is that Bob will reject the offer, but I'm still guaranteed to make a profit of $500,000 by selling to John.

This offer balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
