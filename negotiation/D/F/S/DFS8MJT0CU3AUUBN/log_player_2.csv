"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe could significantly enhance your business operations. Given its value to us, I propose a starting price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, the proposed price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation that is well below our maximum budget. This gives us room to negotiate upward if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget while still valuing our product appropriately, I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to our budget, we are still quite a bit above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I could potentially meet you at $750,000. It's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also holds firm on staying below our $800,000 limit.  We are still a significant margin below her counter-offer, but it allows room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I've considered your proposal and, in an effort to find common ground, I am willing to accept $825,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a price we might accept, but we are still above John's offer. We are in a good position to push for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is pushing my budget constraints. To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option at $800,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Transparency:** We're being open about having another offer, which adds weight to our negotiation.
* **Finality:** We are signaling that this is our best offer and we're ready to move on if it's not accepted. 
* **Respect:** We're maintaining a respectful tone and acknowledging Alice's efforts.

This puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can accept our offer and make a good profit, or risk losing the sale altogether."
