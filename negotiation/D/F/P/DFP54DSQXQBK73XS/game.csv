"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a generous offer to get the ball rolling. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,150,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach a certain price point, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a good compromise and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still below my minimum price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
