"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible outcome.  While I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I'm hoping to leverage his interest and potentially find a middle ground. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer downwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal.  This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but also that I won't settle for a price significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd still prefer $9,500, I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal with Bob and then be forced to sell to John for $10,000."
