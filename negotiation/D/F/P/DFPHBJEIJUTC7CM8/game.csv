"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the value I can get from the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $10500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $11200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $11200. I'm willing to go up to $10800, and that's my final offer. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints.",10800.0,Bob,6,
