"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets a strong negotiation position. 
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $12,500 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating that Bob is serious about buying but also looking for a good deal.
* **Clear message:** The message is friendly and polite while directly stating Bob's position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for Alice to lower the price further.  
* **Staying firm:** Bob wants to save as much as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer shows he's committed to getting a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still rounds left. Bob might be able to convince Alice to come down to a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to go there."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** Bob increases his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Fair compromise:**  $13,000 represents a middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's previous offer.
* **Closing statement:**  The message emphasizes Bob's readiness to close the deal, potentially pushing Alice to accept."
