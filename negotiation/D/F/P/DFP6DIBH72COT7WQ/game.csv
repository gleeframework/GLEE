"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. Can we try $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a little low for me.  Let's compromise one last time.  I'm willing to go down to $98.  This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. How about we go with $99? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,99.0,Bob,6,
