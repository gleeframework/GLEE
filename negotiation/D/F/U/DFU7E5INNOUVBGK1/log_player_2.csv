"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and represents a substantial saving. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice decides to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still within Bob's budget, and only $500 more than his previous counteroffer.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a higher price from Alice or a stalemate. Given the potential for escalation, it's more prudent for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still a decent savings compared to buying from John."
