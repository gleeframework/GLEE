"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **You are willing to pay $1,000,000 maximum.**
* **Alice's offer is $1,000,000.**
* **John is also selling the product for $1,000,000.**

Since both Alice and John are offering the same price, you can reject Alice's offer and still buy the product from John. This doesn't save you money, but it gives you the option to potentially find a better deal in the future."
