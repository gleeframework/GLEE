{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $16,000 is close, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go to $17,000? It's a fair price for the quality of this product."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am trying to find a middle ground. Would you consider selling the product for $16,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is very close to my ideal price.  While I could potentially push for more, I'm confident that a deal at $16,500 is a good outcome. It's much better than selling to John for $15,000, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away altogether."
