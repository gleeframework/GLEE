{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like it's a good deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range.
* **John as a safety net:** Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option of selling to John for $100, which is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you being upfront with your price point. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob that $85 is still a good deal for him, implying that he's getting a bargain compared to my initial price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to ensure the negotiation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $72.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, $72.5 is still below that threshold.
* **Opportunity for final counteroffer:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make one final counteroffer and potentially reach an agreement closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of losing John:** Although John is a safety net, I want to explore all options with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 

I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $85 or $90 to see if we can reach a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that.  Let's make one last compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $80. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product at a competitive rate.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a final compromise, showing my commitment to finding a solution while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing the ""fair price"" for both of us helps build a sense of shared interest and encourages acceptance.
* **Clear call to action:** The direct question ""Let me know what you think!"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially conclude the negotiation.

I've chosen to offer $80 because it's a good balance between my desired price and Bob's most recent offer, and it creates a realistic possibility of a successful negotiation."
