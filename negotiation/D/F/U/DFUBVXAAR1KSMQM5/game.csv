"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
