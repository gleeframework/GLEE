# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $950,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering the value this product holds for you. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is lower than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above your budget.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to this transaction, Bob. In light of our ongoing dialogue, I am willing to consider $885,000 as the final price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $85,000 above my budget, and it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult.  Accepting her offer allows me to secure the product while minimizing my financial risk.  It's also worth noting that John's offer is not guaranteed, and there's a risk that I could miss out on the product completely if I try to negotiate further."
