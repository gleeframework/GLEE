"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. Would you like to buy it from me for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $200 is a bit steep for me. How about $175? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $190. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $190 is a bit high for my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $180? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $180. How about we meet in the middle at $185? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $185 is still pushing it.  How about $182?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",182.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $182, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms. How about we do $182, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's not included in the original price? This way, you'll get even more value for your money. What do you think?",182.0,Alice,7,
