"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This price is fair and allows us both to find a compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
