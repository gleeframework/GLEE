"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer and the extras. However, $10,500 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This seems like a fair compromise to me.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm thinking of a price of $9,800. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
