Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?

Alice is still quite a bit above John's price. There's room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that.

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still not there yet. It's worth one more try to see if we can get a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:

It's time to switch to John. Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price at this point. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
