{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to your desired price point, but there's still room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get her down to $850,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
``` 

Let's try to split the difference and see if Alice will accept $860,000. It's a small compromise, but still a good saving for us."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is proving stubborn, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. It's not worth risking losing the product entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the safest option at this point."
