Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the thought, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Can we negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. How about $13,000? That's still a great deal for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $12,500. This allows us to remain close to my budget while still considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it's within a reasonable range for me. I'll accept his offer."
