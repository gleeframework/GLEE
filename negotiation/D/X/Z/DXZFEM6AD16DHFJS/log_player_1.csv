Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $90?  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we're both getting a good deal, and I can get the product without needing to go to John. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5.
