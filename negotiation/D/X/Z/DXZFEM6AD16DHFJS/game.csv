"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $90?  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? It's still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That way we're both getting a good deal, and I can get the product without needing to go to John. Let me know what you think!",102.5,Bob,4,
