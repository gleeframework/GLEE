"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm starting with an offer price of $18000. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $15000?  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000. How about we try $13500?,13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again and go with $14250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13750, but no higher. Can you consider my offer?",13750.0,Bob,6,
