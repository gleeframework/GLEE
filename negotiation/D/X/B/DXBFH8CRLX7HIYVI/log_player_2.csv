"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer of $950,000 and is still below Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiations that might lead to a higher price or a potential deal with John at $1,000,000."
