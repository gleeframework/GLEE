"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum, and I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
