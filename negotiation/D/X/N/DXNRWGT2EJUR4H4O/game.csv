"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $140? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'd be happy to sell it to you for $150. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
