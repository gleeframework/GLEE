Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, potentially justifying the higher price in his mind.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly hinting that you have other options (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  You know your minimum price is $12,000 (from John), so use that as your baseline in further discussions."
