"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1900000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm counteroffering at $1850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
