Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value and the benefit you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $1,000) while still giving you a significant profit margin.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $12,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
