"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is higher than both her own valuation and my maximum price. There is significant room for negotiation.  I will reject the offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we're still far from a price I'm happy with. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for a significantly lower price and propose a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $8,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $7,500. This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, I believe."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm keeping it significantly below her offer to push for a lower price. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. How about we try $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to your original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met her own valuation of the product. Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for less than John's price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
