"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $8,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $8,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $7,500. This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500. How about we try $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to your original offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
