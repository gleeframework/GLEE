"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value you placed on it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less than $1,000,000 from Alice.  He can counter-offer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $950,000? This still gives you a significant discount and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get the product for a lower price than $950,000, as he's already successfully negotiated down to $900,000. He should counter-offer again."
