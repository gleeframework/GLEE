Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the minimum value to you. It also frames it as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. This approach allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your position, $900,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1025000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant increase from his previous offer. Accepting his offer would be the most profitable choice at this point."
