"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8250? This would give me a bit more wiggle room and still offer you a good deal. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7500, so how about we try $7875? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",7875.0,Bob,4,
