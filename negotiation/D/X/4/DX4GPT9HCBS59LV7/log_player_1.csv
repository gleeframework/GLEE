{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to leave space for a potential counteroffer from Bob without immediately triggering his ""walk away"" point. I'm confident this price is enticing enough for Bob to consider, but also leaves me room to increase the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price of $14,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your proposal, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a reasonable compromise.  It's significantly more than selling to John, and it seems unlikely Bob will go higher. It's time to accept the deal and move on."
