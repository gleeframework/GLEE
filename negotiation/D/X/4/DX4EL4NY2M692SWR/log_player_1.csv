"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle. This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing him and having to sell to John at $12,000 is too high. Accepting this offer will still earn me a decent profit, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price changes."
