"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I've done some research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is the best I can do without losing too much profit.",8200.0,Alice,5,
