"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it for $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" we subtly imply the product is worth more than Bob might initially perceive.
* **Openness:**  Ending with ""open to hearing your thoughts"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than simply walking away. 
 
Remember, we have John as a backup offer, so we can afford to be a bit more ambitious in our initial rounds with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, we are still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob offering $1,500,000 after we started at $2,000,000 indicates potential for a higher closing price.  We have room to negotiate and test his willingness to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We want to signal that we're serious about the higher value while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic tactic can feel like a compromise, even though we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and John's backup.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We continue to emphasize the potential benefits *for Bob*, keeping him focused on the long-term value rather than just the immediate price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, we are still well above our minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting this offer maintains pressure and allows us to gauge how much further he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I've already got a very competitive offer on the table, but I believe in finding the right partnership for this product. Let's settle this right now.  Would you consider $1,725,000?"",
""product_price"": 1725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""settle this right now"" and ""competitive offer"" we introduce a sense of urgency and the possibility of losing the deal.
* **Lower Concession:** We are reducing our concession size, signaling we are reaching our desired price range. 
* **Focus on Partnership:**  Reiterating the ""right partnership"" angle reminds Bob this deal is about more than just the price, potentially adding non-monetary value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,725,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, $1,600,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language (""one more serious offer"", ""as high as I'm willing to go"") suggests this is likely his final concession.
* **Profitable Deal:**  While not our ideal target, $1,600,000 is still a significant profit over our minimum and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, potentially leaving us with John's lower offer. Closing now secures a good outcome."
