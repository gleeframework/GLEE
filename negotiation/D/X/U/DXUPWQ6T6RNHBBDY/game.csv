"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is significantly below what it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $6,500 is still too low. How about we compromise at $8,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it would allow us both to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
