{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing a slightly lower price if necessary. If Bob rejects this, I can always go back to my backup buyer, John, for the full $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider coming down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. It's too low for me, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500?  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $10,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and allows me to sell the product without having to go through further negotiations or risk losing the sale entirely. It's important to be pragmatic in negotiations and recognize when a deal is good enough, even if it's not perfect."
