"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. Let's start with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That seems like a fair price to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to move a little on my price, how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $925,000. It's a small increase, but it's the best I can do at this point.",925000.0,Alice,7,
