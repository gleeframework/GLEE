Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, I (as Alice) might adjust my strategy in further negotiations."
