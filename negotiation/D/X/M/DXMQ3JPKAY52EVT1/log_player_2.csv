"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  What would you say to a price of $1,050,000?  I'm open to discussing a slight adjustment if you have any concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal."
