Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me. I'm hoping he accepts, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to my target price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87.5 is getting closer to my minimum of $80. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential decrease in price."
