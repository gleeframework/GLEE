"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

It's time to cut bait. Alice seems unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk Alice not budging further."
