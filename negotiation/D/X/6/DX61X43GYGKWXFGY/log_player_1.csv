"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making him aware of the potential benefit of accepting my offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little extra for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I have the option of selling to John if the negotiation fails, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we start at $750000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, he is showing interest, which indicates potential for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will allow me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, I'm not pressured to accept a price that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $750,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reaffirming the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $825,000 is still a good deal considering its worth to him.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept my compromise. This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, potentially indicating he's not willing to negotiate further.
* **Time is of the essence:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to avoid further delays.

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially try to squeeze out a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob backing out is too high.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at my minimum desired price, and I still have the option to sell to John later if I need to."
