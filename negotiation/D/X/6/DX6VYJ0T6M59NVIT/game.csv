"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $90 is lower than I can realistically go, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That way we can both walk away happy. ðŸ˜Š",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this.  $100 is a great offer, but I'm just a little bit higher than that. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  I really want you to have this product!",115.0,Alice,5,
