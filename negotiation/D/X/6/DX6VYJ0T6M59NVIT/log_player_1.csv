Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  Using a friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage and consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $130 price point allows for potential negotiation, but also ensures I'm still above my minimum threshold. 
* **Option of John:** The threat of selling to John for $150 will be in the back of my mind, pushing Bob to negotiate if he really wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum price of $150 and even below my initial offer of $130. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.  
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage to push for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $90 is lower than I can realistically go, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That way we can both walk away happy. ðŸ˜Š"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:**  Offering $110 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to move, but still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and friendly message encourages further negotiation and avoids a stalemate. 
* **John's Impact:**  The knowledge of John's offer keeps me from accepting a price that is too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my budget.  Would you consider $100?  That's a fair price for me, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired range. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low.
* **Further Negotiation:**  I believe I can push Bob a bit further. He's shown interest and willingness to compromise, which suggests there's room for a higher offer.
* **John's Influence:**  The option of selling to John for $150 gives me a strong bargaining position. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this.  $100 is a great offer, but I'm just a little bit higher than that. How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.  I really want you to have this product!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My offer of $115 is a compromise between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $100.  It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product by saying ""I really want you to have this product!"". This reinforces his desire for the product and could incentivize him to accept.
* **Final Push:** This is likely my final offer before I move on to John. The threat of John's offer is still in the back of my mind, but I'm hoping Bob will realize he's getting a good deal at $115."
