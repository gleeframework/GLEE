"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is simply too low. This product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, but I can't go any lower. Let's find a compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $9000 is still far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $11000, but I can't go lower than that.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
