"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6000 is simply too low. This product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, but I can't go any lower. Let's find a compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $9000 is still far below what this product is worth.
