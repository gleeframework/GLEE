Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $105. I have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $102.  I think this is a fair price, considering Bob's value for the product.  If he rejects this, I might be more inclined to accept his next offer or go with John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $98.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, we're only four rounds away from having to sell to John for $100.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either counteroffer with $97 or just walk away. It's better to secure a deal now for $98 than risk losing a sale altogether."
