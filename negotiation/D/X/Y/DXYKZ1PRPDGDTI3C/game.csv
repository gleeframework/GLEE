"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above what I could get from another seller. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what I could get from another buyer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
