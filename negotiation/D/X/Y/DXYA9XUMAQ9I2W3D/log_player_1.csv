{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures that I don't immediately lose a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $10,000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $9,000. I've done some more research and I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm interested in making a deal with Bob, I don't want to risk selling the product for so much less than its value to me.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
