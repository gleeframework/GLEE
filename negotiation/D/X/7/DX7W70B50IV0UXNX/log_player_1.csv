Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $140 offer signals potential willingness to go lower, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of immediately rejecting. 
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. If Bob accepts, you earn more than selling to John. If Bob rejects, you still have your guaranteed $150."
