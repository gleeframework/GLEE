Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 aims to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. He gets it for $10 less than its value to him, and you make a significant profit over your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
