Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1,400,000 is a bit steep. Given the product's value and our mutual goal of reaching a fair agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find a price we're both happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,300,000 still feels high to me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000,  which is a good compromise and allows us to move forward with this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
