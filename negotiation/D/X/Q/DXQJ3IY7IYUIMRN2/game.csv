"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $1,400,000 is a bit steep. Given the product's value and our mutual goal of reaching a fair agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find a price we're both happy with.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product has immense value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  How about we meet halfway?  I propose $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,300,000 still feels high to me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000,  which is a good compromise and allows us to move forward with this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,280,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
