"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it,  which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $825,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This way, you still get a good price for the product, and I'm able to stay within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
