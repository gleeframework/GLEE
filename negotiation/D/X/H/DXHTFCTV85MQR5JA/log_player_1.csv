Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Creating Perceived Value:**  The message hints at high demand (""before I list it publicly,"" ""anticipating demand""). This aims to make the product seem more desirable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it's not so outrageous that it would instantly turn Bob away. This leaves space for him to counter-offer, starting a negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay slightly more depending on its importance to him and the perceived value you've created. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to aim high initially."
