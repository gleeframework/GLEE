"Alice, your product looks interesting, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, as a compromise. It's still a good price for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",8500.0,Bob,4,
