"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down to $7,500, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  I'm really interested in this product and want to make a deal, but that's my absolute bottom line.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty about your bottom line. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,250. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
