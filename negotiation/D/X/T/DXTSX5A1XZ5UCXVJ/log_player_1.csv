"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can get him to move closer to $1,350,000.  We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's last offer.  I want to see if this smaller adjustment will convince him to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is very close to my minimum value and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
