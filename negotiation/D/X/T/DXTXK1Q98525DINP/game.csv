,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $200 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $160. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,6,
