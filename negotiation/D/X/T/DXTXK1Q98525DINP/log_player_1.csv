Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. I think it's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but not too high to deter Bob right away. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $200 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $160. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $140 is close to my minimum,  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's getting close to the end.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll take the sure thing and sell to him."
