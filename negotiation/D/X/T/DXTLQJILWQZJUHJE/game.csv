"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.  This is a good compromise and gives you a significant discount. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'd like to propose a price of $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price and shows that I'm committed to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,
