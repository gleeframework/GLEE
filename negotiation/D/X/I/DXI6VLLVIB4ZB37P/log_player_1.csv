This offer gives me a good starting point, while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm interested in making a deal with him, I'm not going to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything below $1,300,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer $1,280,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, the risk of him walking away is high.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell to him and secure the $1,500,000.  It's a better outcome for me than risking further negotiation with Bob."
