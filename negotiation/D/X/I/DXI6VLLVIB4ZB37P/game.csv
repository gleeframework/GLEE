"Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and we can both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer $1,280,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
