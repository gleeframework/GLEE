"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the significant value it holds and represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $2,000,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
