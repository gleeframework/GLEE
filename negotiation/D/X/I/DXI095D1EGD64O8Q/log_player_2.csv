"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $90, which is a good price.
* However, you can get the product from John for $100, which means you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get her to lower her price or explore other options."
