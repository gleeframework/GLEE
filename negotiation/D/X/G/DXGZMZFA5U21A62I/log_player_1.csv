Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price. $11,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to see if we can compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for $11,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make a good use of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

While $11,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, it's still better than selling to John for $10,000. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
