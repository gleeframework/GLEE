Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping he values the product highly enough to accept this initial offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary.  I'm also mindful of my fallback option with John, so I'm not going to risk dropping below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial $15,000 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum value. While I could counteroffer again, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum of $12,000, it's best to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
