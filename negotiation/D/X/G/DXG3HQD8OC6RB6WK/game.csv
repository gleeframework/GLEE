"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product for less. I am willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer of $105.  To be honest, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $110. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price that recognizes both of our needs.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer of $110. I understand your position, but I believe I can still find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $107 for the product.",107.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $107 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a final compromise on my end,  and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",112.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your offer of $112. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $108 for the product.",108.0,Bob,8,
