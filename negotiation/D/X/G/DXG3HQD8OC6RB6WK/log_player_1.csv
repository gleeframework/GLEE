"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $130. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) and a bit above Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:**  A friendly and positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a brief reason (""I think it's worth $130"") can make the price seem more justified.

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit. I'm willing to negotiate further, but this initial offer positions me favorably for a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product for less. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While I could accept and make a small profit, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I'd prefer to explore a deal with Bob if possible. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and respectful to encourage continued negotiation.

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about striking a deal with Bob while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for improvement:**  While it's getting closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John remains a solid backup:**  Selling to John for $120 is still a viable option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm committed to getting a price closer to my value. This strategy increases my chances of a better outcome in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the offer of $105.  To be honest, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try $110. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair price that recognizes both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a further compromise, but still maintains a profit margin for me.  It shows flexibility without completely caving in.
* **Highlighting my effort:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is a ""significant compromise"" to make the offer seem more appealing and emphasize my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a price that is ""fair"" to both parties.

By continuing to negotiate and proposing a price closer to Bob's offer, I am showing my desire to close the deal while still securing a reasonable price for myself. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward with a chance of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer of $110. I understand your position, but I believe I can still find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $107 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While it's getting closer, the difference between his offer and my minimum is small. There might not be much more room for negotiation.
* **John remains a good option:**  Selling to John for $120 is still a good fallback option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing that I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price. However, I'm still willing to keep negotiating to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $107 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112. This is a final compromise on my end,  and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm highlighting this counteroffer as a ""final compromise"" to add a sense of urgency and show I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price,  even though it's close to his offer.
* **Option Reminder:**  I subtly mention that I will ""consider other options"" to remind Bob that selling to John is an alternative. This adds pressure to close the deal.

This counteroffer is a small step toward Bob's price, but it's still above my minimum and leaves a slight profit margin. The ""final compromise"" approach adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer of $112. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $108 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:** Bob's offer of $108 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price.  There is very little room for further negotiation to get a significantly better price. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that I might not reach an agreement with Bob and end up with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and a certain outcome.

At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  Selling to John ensures a good outcome with no further risk of a failed deal."
