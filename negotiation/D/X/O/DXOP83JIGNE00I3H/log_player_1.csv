Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a chance to gain a significant asset for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our two offers. How about we settle on $1,100,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, I'm aiming for a price closer to my original offer. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my initial offer,  $975,000 is still a significant difference from the product's value to both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further as there's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe $975,000 undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a compromise â€“ would you consider $1,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to move a bit more. How about we settle at $1,010,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is a reasonable compromise.  While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might significantly lower his offer in the next round. Accepting now secures a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
