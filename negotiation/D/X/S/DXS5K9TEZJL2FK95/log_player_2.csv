# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."

You're still $1,000 over your target price. Even though Alice has lowered her offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate a better deal."

While Alice has come down in price, you are still $750 over your target price. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at your target price, it makes sense to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
