# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. Considering its significance and your appreciation for it, I propose to offer this item to you at a special price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $1,200,000, while still ensuring a fair return for me. I believe this price reflects the quality, rarity, and importance of the product, making it a compelling deal for both parties. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's price of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Bob can still make a profit:**  Even at $950,000, Bob is still buying the product for less than his maximum value of $1,200,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best financial decision for Bob."
