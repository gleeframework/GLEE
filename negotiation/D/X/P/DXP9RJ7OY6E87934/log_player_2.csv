"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal. He knows Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, so he's starting his counteroffer close to that price.  This is a bold move, but it shows Alice he's serious about getting a good price and might encourage her to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better deal than John's price, Bob can still try to do better.  He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and Alice has shown some flexibility. There's still room to try and get the price down closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still aiming for a good price.  $11,000 is a compromise point, likely appealing to Alice, and it's still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $11,200 is very close to his ideal price and getting it lower might be difficult. It's a good deal, saving him a significant amount compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer ensures he gets the product without risking further rounds and potential counteroffers that could make the deal worse."
