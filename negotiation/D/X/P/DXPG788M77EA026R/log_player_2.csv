"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's in my best interest to negotiate a much lower price, especially since I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable starting at a figure closer to its actual market value. How about we discuss a price around $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues its unique features and potential benefits. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $1,200,000 is still significantly above my budget. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to push for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to see a price that reflects a realistic market value. Could we consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this purchase, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I'm prepared to make another move, but it needs to be substantial. To be clear, this product holds significant value beyond typical market comparisons. If we're going to make this work, I propose $1,000,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer, and it's still above my maximum budget and my backup option. While I could continue negotiating, there's a real risk Alice won't budge further. It makes the most financial sense to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
