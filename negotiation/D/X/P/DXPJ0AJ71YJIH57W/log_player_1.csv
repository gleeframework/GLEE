Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  I know it's something you've been interested in, and based on its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,380,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,380,000 is a strong starting point. It allows for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit. Bob saves $120,000 compared to his valuation, making it an attractive deal.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a smoother deal.
