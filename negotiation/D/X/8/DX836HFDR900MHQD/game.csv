"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this truly unique product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a figure closer to its true value.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
