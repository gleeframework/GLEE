I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we possibly negotiate down to $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $17000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to propose a price of $16500 for the product.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, $16500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $17500. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've been considering the value of the product and I think $17000 would be a fair price for us both. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $17500. I've already made some concessions, and I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you a price of $17200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",17200.0,Alice,9,
