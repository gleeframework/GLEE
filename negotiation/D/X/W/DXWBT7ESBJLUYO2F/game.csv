"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you have to sell it at a price that makes sense for you, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $95 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
