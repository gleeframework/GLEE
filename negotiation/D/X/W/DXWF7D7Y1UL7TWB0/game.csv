"Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
