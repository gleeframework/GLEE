Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise, but $8,500 is still a stretch for me. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $7,500. That's the absolute best I can do.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
