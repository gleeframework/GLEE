I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially earning more. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell it."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

I'm countering with a price of $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than his offered price."
