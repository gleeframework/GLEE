"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I can still make a good profit. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're really interested in the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both get what we want.

Alice's offer:
