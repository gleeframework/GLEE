Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $110 gives me a good starting point for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer. By offering $110, I allow for a potential counteroffer and further negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to stand firm during negotiations. If Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, I can confidently walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can push for a higher price.  Bob acknowledged the product's value by offering more than his initial assessment ($80).
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Having John's offer of $120 gives me a strong position to counter Bob's offer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value again to remind Bob it's worth more than $95.
* **Final offer possibility:**  This counteroffer positions me to potentially end the negotiation with a satisfactory price. If Bob rejects, I can consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob is willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **John's offer:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price, aiming to get closer to my desired outcome while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful increase:**  A small increase to $102 shows I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a better price. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair price"" for both of us to encourage acceptance.
* **Final offer implication:**  The message implies this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **John's offer as backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $120."
