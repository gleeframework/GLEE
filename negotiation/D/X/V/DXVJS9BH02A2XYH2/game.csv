"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if this is within your consideration.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to go down to $102.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",102.0,Alice,5,
