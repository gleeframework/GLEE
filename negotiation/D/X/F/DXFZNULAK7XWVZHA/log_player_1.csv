Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm ready to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $160 is less than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether, especially since John is also offering my minimum price."
