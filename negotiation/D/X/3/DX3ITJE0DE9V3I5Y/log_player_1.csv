Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still leaving some room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob values the product higher, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget, and that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to squeeze out a bit more, Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good deal. It's above my minimum price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only waste time and potentially lead to a lower price."
