Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your $800,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He's willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still far below what you initially hoped to get. It's worth pushing for a higher price. You can counteroffer to see if you can reach a middle ground before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
