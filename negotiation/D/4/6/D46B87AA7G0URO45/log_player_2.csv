"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John is too high at this point."
