Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.
