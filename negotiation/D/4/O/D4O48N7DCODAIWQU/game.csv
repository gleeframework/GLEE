"Hello Bob, it's great to connect with you about this opportunity.  I'm initially offering this product at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, given my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
