"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both.  How about we start the conversation at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($1,800,000) compared to your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, your starting price is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget, and I'm confident it's a deal that will benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,800,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you closer to your range. How about we consider $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, potentially offering a counteroffer closer to my budget. If she rejects again, I can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
