Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, while still ensuring the deal is significantly better for you than John's $800,000 offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still being appealing to Bob. He gets a $75,000 discount from his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further."
