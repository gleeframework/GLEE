"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount from my original valuation of $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 John is willing to sell the product for. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal from John and save $200,000."
