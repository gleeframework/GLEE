"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice is starting at $110. There's room to negotiate for a lower price. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're aiming for a price well below our maximum budget of $120. Starting with a counteroffer of $90 leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. To better accommodate your budget, how about we agree on $100 for the product? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still in a good negotiating position. There's no rush to accept just yet. Let's try for a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $100 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $95."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're nudging closer to Alice's price while still staying below our psychological threshold of $100. This shows willingness to compromise while aiming for a desirable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we finalize the deal at $98 for the product? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $98 is a great price, well below our $120 maximum and a significant saving compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
