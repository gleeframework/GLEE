I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him higher before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get more, $80 is my minimum price and it's a good deal considering the possibility of selling to John for the same price."
