{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80.  While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $80 was a bit optimistic. How about we split the difference and settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value of $100, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a guarantee of a higher price. I'd rather secure the sale now and move on."
