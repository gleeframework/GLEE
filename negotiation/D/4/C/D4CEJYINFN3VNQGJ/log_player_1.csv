"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common practice to start high in negotiations to leave room for compromise. I'm setting the bar at $1,000,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential with phrases like ""incredible"" and ""once-in-a-lifetime."" This helps create a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and allows him to express his initial thoughts. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Financial Situation:** I don't have any information about Bob's ability to pay. This offer is a starting point, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses.
* **Product's Uniqueness:**  The more unique the product, the more leverage I have. However, if it's a commodity, I might have to adjust my expectations. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer provides a safety net, my goal is to maximize profit.  I'll only accept John's offer if I believe I can't get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Leverage:** I have leverage because I have a backup offer from John for $800,000. This allows me to be more assertive in my counteroffers.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and explore if I can secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer.  This will demonstrate that I am willing to negotiate while also showing that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at $1,000,000, I'm willing to come down to $975,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value you'll receive.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still demonstrating the value I place on the product.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a specific reason for my counteroffer (""significant discount"") and emphasize the value Bob will receive. This adds credibility and makes my offer more appealing.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my initial offer as possible. This strategy aims to achieve that by:

*  Maintaining a strong stance while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
*  Creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is the best possible deal. 
*  Keeping the lines of communication open to see if we can reach an agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  Bob's offer is very close to my initial goal of maximizing profit. It's only $15,000 less than my counteroffer, and a significant increase from John's offer.
* **Time Constraints:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers and risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** It's unclear how much further Bob is willing to go. Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower price or even a stalemate.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this stage.  It's a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing out entirely."
