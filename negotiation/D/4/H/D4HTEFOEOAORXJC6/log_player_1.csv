{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, as I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm confident John will buy for $150, so I have some room to play with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to take the $140, especially since I know John will buy for $150.  This avoids any further negotiation and secures a sale."
