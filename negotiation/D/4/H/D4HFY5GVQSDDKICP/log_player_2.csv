"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its potential benefits to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than my initial counteroffer of $750,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $837500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $900000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my budget. It's also likely that further negotiation would be difficult as she's already made several concessions.  While I could risk continuing to negotiate, I'm confident that buying the product at $900,000 is a good deal, considering my maximum budget of $1,500,000."
