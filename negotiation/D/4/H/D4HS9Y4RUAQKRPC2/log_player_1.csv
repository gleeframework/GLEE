{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is in the middle of what you value the product at ($10,000) and what Bob values it at ($15,000). It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than $10,000, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $12,500? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $12,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,250 is still below what I'd ideally want, it's a good compromise and much closer to my initial offer. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $10,000."
