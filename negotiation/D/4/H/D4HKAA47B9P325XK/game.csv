"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $800,000 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would still leave you a significant margin for profit while allowing me to meet my minimum requirement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
