Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and what it can achieve for you.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the value this product will bring you.
