Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more interested in buying it.

This is just my initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy and counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $85 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. I can still try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at the new price."
