{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that might lead to a higher final price.

**Remember:** You can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response and your desire to reach a deal quickly versus maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your absolute minimum of $12,000, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $14,000.  You're still in a good position to negotiate:

* **Bob recognizes the value:**  His counteroffer shows he wants the product and is willing to pay a premium. This means there's room to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **You have a backup:**  John is willing to pay $12,000, so you don't have to settle for a price that feels too low. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer that's closer to your initial price and see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still protecting your profit margin.
* **Fairness:**  $12,500 is exactly in the middle of your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a fair compromise.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for Bob to encourage a quicker agreement. 

**Remember:** This is a strategic counteroffer that aims to find common ground and move the negotiation towards a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay.  This means:

* **No risk of losing money:** You're guaranteed to sell the product at your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting the offer ends the negotiation quickly and avoids further rounds of counteroffers.
* **Potentially better terms:**  Bob might be willing to negotiate further down the line if he needs the product urgently, giving you an opportunity to potentially earn more.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and you having to sell to John at the same price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
