Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice aims for a price close to that while leaving room for negotiation.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to get a price significantly higher than her $800,000 alternative.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is positive but clearly states the desired price, showing Alice is serious about maximizing her profit.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. 
* Depending on the context (relationship with Bob, urgency of the sale), Alice could adjust her initial offer and messaging."
