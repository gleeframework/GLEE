"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Let's try $8,750.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to secure a higher offer, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This gives us both a fair price, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet at $8,800?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,800 is a tempting offer, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and I'm not convinced we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm better off selling the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum desired price.  This way, I can ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
