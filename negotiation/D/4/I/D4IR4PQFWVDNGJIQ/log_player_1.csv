Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's potential for a price higher than your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**The Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim high but leave Bob with a perceived benefit. Here's how:

1. **Start High:** Begin with a price significantly closer to Bob's valuation than your minimum. 
2. **Justification:**  Provide a reason for the high price, subtly emphasizing the product's value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its potential and value in the market, I'm placing its price at $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Approach Works**

* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""unique"" nature and ""significant returns,"" subtly justifying the price.
* **Perceived Gain:** While the price is high, Bob sees a potential profit of $100,000 ($1,500,000 valuation - $1,400,000 price).

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. That's why having John as a backup is crucial."
