"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is too far below its true value. I could consider $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,325,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,200,000. Would that be workable for you?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
