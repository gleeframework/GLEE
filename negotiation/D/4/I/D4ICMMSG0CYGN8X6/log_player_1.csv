Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short. Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our desired amount. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds Bob's perceived value by mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential.""  
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price. By ending with ""Let me know what you think,"" we invite a counter-offer and keep the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** We don't know how likely Bob is to negotiate or walk away. If we start too high, he might not even bother countering.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We have a guaranteed buyer in John. If time is a factor, we might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob to close the deal quickly."
