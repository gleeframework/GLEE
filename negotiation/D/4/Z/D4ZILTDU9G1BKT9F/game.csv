"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I think this price is fair, given the value you place on it and my maximum budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer you $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you've placed on it, and it's the highest I'm able to offer at this time.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $850,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement with you. I'm offering the product to you for $995,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",995000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $995,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase on my previous offer and reflects my sincere desire to reach an agreement. I hope we can finally settle on this price.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm starting to think that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price, but I'm not going to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $980,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to explore other options.",980000.0,Alice,9,
