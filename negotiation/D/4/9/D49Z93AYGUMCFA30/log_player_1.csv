Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $9,000.  This is a great product, and I know it's worth it to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I want to maximize my earnings and see if I can get a higher offer in the next round. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, which gives me some bargaining power."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  To maximize my profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
