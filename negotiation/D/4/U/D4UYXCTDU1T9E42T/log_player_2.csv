# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a fair price for me.  Consider this a win-win opportunity. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
