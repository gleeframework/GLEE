"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his maximum budget while also showing Alice he's serious about buying the product.
* **Justification:** The message explains the reason for the counteroffer, focusing on the price being too high for Bob, not the product itself. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has lowered her price, $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room to negotiate.  Bob can try to get closer to his desired price by making another counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John at $8,000 is a guaranteed deal, but it's a risk to miss out on a potentially lower price from Alice.  It's worth continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $9,000? That's a reasonable compromise for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($9,500) and his previous offer ($8,500). 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** This offer still keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing the desire to find a solution that works for both parties."
