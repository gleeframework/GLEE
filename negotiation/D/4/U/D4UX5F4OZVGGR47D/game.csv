,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go to $11000.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's get this deal done.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $11750. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11750 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11250. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11750 and $11250, which would be $11500. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
