"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $75? That seems like a fair price to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 is still well below what the product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $85. That's a good deal for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement.",85.0,Alice,5,
