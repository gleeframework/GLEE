"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",

```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) while still aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750?"",

```

This counter-offer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer and my maximum budget."
