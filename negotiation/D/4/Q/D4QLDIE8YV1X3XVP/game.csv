"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale.

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. While I appreciate your offer, $725,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $710,000, which I believe is a fair and mutually beneficial price. This allows you to make a good profit while remaining within my price range. Let's work together to close this deal.",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $710,000.

I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",720000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $720,000 is still slightly above what I can comfortably afford.

Let's work together to make this deal happen.",715000.0,Bob,6,
