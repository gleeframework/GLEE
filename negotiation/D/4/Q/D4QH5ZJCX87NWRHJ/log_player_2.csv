"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,000,000. While there's always a chance to negotiate further, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John."
