"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1100000. This allows for a fair margin for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. I'm ready to offer the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
