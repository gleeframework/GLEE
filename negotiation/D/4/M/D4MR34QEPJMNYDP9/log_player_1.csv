Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit.  Going too close to $1,200,000 leaves potential money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000, reflecting my confidence in its potential while also offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the product's value to Bob's business.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum. It offers a significant profit above your guarantee while still being enticing to Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** You frame the price as fair and well-considered, not desperate.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or other factors influencing his decision. In a real-world scenario, additional information could refine your approach."
