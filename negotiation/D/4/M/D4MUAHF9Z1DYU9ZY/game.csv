"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. It's a premium product, and I believe it's worth every penny. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product is premium, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1050000? It's a fair price for a product of this caliber, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose $980000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",980000.0,Bob,6,
