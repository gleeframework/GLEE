"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Confidence:** I'm confident in the value of the product and believe Bob will see the worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for some back-and-forth to potentially reach a win-win situation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is my minimum value, and accepting this would leave me with no profit.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Even though Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I want to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While I could sell to John for $80, I want to maximize my profit. This is a good fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can't go as low as $80, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $120 to $100. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $100 is still a profitable price for me, exceeding my minimum of $80.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $100 is a good deal. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't do $80, but $100 is still a bit much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $90 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price of $100 and still yields a decent profit. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away or dragging out the process further. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  A successful negotiation with Bob could lead to future opportunities.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and the clock is ticking. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is an option,  $90 is a better deal, and there's no guarantee that I will find a better buyer in the future."
