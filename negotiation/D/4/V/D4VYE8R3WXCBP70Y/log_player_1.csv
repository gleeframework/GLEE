"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm also trying to build rapport by suggesting he might love the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to sell the product below my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price to show that I'm willing to negotiate but still staying above my minimum.  I'm also emphasizing that I'm trying to work with him to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $92 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.  While it's still slightly below my minimum, it's close enough that it's worth it to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale. It's better to get $92 than to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for $100."
