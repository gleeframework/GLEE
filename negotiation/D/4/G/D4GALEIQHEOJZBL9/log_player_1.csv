{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be worth even more to you in the long run.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussion, which may lead to a faster agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider lowering my price to stay within his range. 
* I'll also keep John in mind.  If I feel like the negotiation with Bob is going nowhere, I can always sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate.  
* **John as an Option:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides a safety net and leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll need to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. I'll aim for a price that's more attractive to Bob while still maximizing my own gain. 
* **Monitoring John:** I'll keep John's offer in mind and be ready to sell to him if the negotiation with Bob goes on for too long or if Bob becomes unreasonable."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference - how about $925,000? This price still provides you with a great value for my product, and it's closer to what I need to accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This signals that I'm willing to be flexible but still stand my ground.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that even at $925,000, he's getting a good deal.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a profitable deal. 
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider my options:
    * **Lower Counteroffer:**  I could lower my counteroffer slightly, but I'll be careful not to drop too low.
    * **Consider John:** If Bob's counteroffers are consistently unacceptable, I'll consider selling to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I still aim to stay within my financial limits. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $875,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Progress, but Not Enough:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, the gap is still significant.
* **John as Safety Net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which guarantees a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll need to make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and highlight the potential for future profit for Bob.
* **Monitor Time:** I'll be mindful of how long the negotiation is taking.  If it's dragging on and no agreement seems close, I'll be prepared to sell to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final price of $887,500. This would allow us to come to an agreement that is fair for both parties.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $887,500 is closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly lower. 
* **Time to Secure Profit:**  We've gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and Bob is showing a pattern of offering just below my minimum.  
* **John's Guaranteed Value:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my guaranteed minimum.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I get the value I want and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This avoids the risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers and ensures I get the best possible outcome."
