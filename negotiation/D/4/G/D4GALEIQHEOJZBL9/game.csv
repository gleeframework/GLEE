"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $850,000 is a step closer, it's still below what I need to make this work.  Let's split the difference - how about $925,000? This price still provides you with a great value for my product, and it's closer to what I need to accept. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. However, I still aim to stay within my financial limits. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $875,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your continued interest in my product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.
