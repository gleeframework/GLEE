You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or you can always fall back on John's offer."
