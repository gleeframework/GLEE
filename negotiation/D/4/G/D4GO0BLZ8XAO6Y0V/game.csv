"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately far above my budget. Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This price allows for some room for negotiation, and is closer to my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
