"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering my value for the product is $12000, I'm willing to offer you $13500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $13500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to reach an agreement. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not ready to accept $14500 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $16250. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make another concession to reach an agreement. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
