"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's priced fairly considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point, there is no room for negotiation. It's more beneficial to buy from John as you know his price is fixed at $1,500,000."
