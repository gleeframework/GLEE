"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This price reflects the product's value while still being a fair deal for you.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. While Alice's offer of $13,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there is still some room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get the price down even further."
