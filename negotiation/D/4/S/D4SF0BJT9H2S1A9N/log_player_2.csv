# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price. At $725,000, I'm saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer, and it's within my budget. I'll accept this offer and move on."
