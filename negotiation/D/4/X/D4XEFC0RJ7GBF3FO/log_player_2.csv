Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1200000 is still below my target, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000, and it's likely that we're close to the limit of her flexibility.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is the most secure option at this point."
