Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message implies it's worth considering.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning a public listing subtly implies there's other interest, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion and doesn't force Bob into a corner.

This approach aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
