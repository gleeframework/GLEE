"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $120? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $100 is still too low.  Let's compromise at $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can guarantee you'll be happy with this product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the sale.",95.0,Bob,6,
