"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could potentially get a better price from John, I'll try to negotiate further with Bob in the hope of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $120? That's still a good price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $100?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm hopeful that I can get Bob to go a little higher.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $100 is still too low.  Let's compromise at $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can guarantee you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've been negotiating for a few rounds, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my price expectations.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, it's in my best interest to take that offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
