"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this valuable product with you. Given its unique nature and significant potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value it brings to your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no way I'm going to accept that.  I'll reject and counteroffer to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'll bring to it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of what this product can do. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price takes into account the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay that much, and I still believe I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I believe $1,200,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I'll bring to the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
