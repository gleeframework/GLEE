"Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this valuable product with you. Given its unique nature and significant potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'll bring to it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of what this product can do. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price takes into account the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I believe $1,200,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I'll bring to the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
