"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be open to discussing.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential return on investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value, but we need to find a middle ground.  Would you consider $650,000? This reflects a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the potential of the product.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe you would be a great partner.  My final offer is $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your final offer is reasonable, and I appreciate the movement on price. However, to be completely transparent with you, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000. I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price. If you're unable to meet this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
