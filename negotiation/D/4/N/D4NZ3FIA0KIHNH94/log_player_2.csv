Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While getting to $750,000 would be ideal, $800,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal."
