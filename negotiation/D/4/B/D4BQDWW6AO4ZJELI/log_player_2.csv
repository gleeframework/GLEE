Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I've considered your proposal carefully. In light of our ongoing dialogue, I am prepared to offer the product at $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's offer of $875,000 represents a substantial savings of $125,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly from her initial price. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will stick to her price or even raise it.  There's also the possibility that negotiations could drag on and waste time.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer seems like the best choice to secure a significant saving while minimizing risk."
