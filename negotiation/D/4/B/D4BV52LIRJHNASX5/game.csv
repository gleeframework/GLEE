"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my current financial situation, I am not able to commit to a price as high as $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to commit to a price as high as $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point, but I need to be closer to my original ask to make this worthwhile for me. My final offer is $1,850,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
