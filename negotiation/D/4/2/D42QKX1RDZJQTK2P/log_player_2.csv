"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, that price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Could you do it for $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiating is about finding a middle ground. Starting significantly lower than your true maximum price ($80) gives you room to haggle. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This offer will help gauge how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she flatly refuses, you know you'll need to increase your offer substantially or consider John. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space for her to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $60 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $90 is still above your $80 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she might go lower.  There's no harm in seeing if you can get closer to your target price. 
* **John's Offer Remains:** You still have the safety net of buying from John at $80 if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and it would work for me."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Offering $75 shows Alice you are willing to move significantly from your initial offer, signaling seriousness. 
* **Below Your Maximum:** It's important to stay below your $80 limit to ensure you're getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if Alice is truly willing to sell closer to your budget or if she's fixed on a price closer to $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $82.50 is still slightly above your maximum budget of $80. 
* **Marginal Gain:**  Negotiating further is unlikely to result in a significant price drop. Alice has shown her willingness to meet in the middle, and $82.50 is likely close to her bottom line.
* **John's Guaranteed Deal:** You have the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $80, which is within your budget and saves you $2.50 compared to Alice's offer. 

At this point, accepting John's offer secures you the product at the best possible price without the risk of further negotiation."
