"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll offer the product to you for $1,060,000. This is my final counteroffer.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
