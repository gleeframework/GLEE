"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is still significantly less than Alice's initial offer and leaves room for potential negotiation. This price is also higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, making it a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is now closer to Bob's desired price point and significantly cheaper than buying from John. While there is still potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on is high. It's more strategic for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
