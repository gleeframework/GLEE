"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10000. It's worth a lot more to you than that, so I think it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's price, but there's still room for negotiation.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000.  
* **Rejecting allows for potential savings.** By rejecting, you can explore lower prices with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay $10,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget and closer to your ideal price.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is now offering the product for $9,500. This is a good compromise.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the time.**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the time it might take to reach a lower price."
