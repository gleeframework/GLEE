"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and other similar products I've seen.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's unique value.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",920000.0,Bob,4,
