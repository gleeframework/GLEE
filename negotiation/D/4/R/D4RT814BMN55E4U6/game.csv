"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still too far off. How about we split the difference at $14,250?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $14,250 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $13,500?  That would make the decision much easier for me.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, I suggest you take it. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,7,
