Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product higher. This should make him more likely to engage, and it allows room for potential counteroffers."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
