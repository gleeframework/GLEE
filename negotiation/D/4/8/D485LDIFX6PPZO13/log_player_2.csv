"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get a better deal by rejecting and negotiating with Alice further. You have leverage because you have a backup option with John."
