Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice didn't reach my ideal price of $10,500, she's signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $11,250 secures a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
