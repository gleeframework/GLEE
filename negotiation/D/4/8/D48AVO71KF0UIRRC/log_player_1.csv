Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value.  This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer, aiming to close the gap while staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying above Bob's counteroffer and my minimum value. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will likely lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that I can reach a deal with Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a substantial profit.  Selling to John would yield less profit, and further negotiations with Bob could potentially lead to a longer process with uncertain outcomes."
