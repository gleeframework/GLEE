"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $850,000 to make it work. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
