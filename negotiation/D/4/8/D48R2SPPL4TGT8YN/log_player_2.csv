"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $850,000 to make it work. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer.  $875,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget and Alice's minimum acceptable price.  While a lower price would be ideal, accepting this offer is a good compromise and saves Bob a significant amount compared to buying from John."
