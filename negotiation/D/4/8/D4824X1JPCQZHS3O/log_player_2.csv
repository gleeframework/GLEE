Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid it's still not enough. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems firmly set above $11,000. You've hit a wall in negotiations and are unlikely to get a price you're happy with.  While buying from John is more expensive than your ideal price, it's better to cut your losses now at $15,000 than risk Alice walking away and potentially having to settle for an even worse deal later."
