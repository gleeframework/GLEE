,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $8500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $8250?"
"I'm glad we're having this conversation, Bob. I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting close, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7200?",7200.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already come down to $8000 from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $7800?"
"I'm trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $7800, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm thinking of a final offer, so let's say... $7600. What do you think?",7600.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7100?",7100.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I can do $7400, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a good deal."
"I'm making a final push, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm willing to meet you at $7400. However, I'm not going to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing product at a fair price. How about we finalize the deal at $7400?",7400.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7200. I think this is a fair price considering the extras you're throwing in.",7200.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I've already offered the product at $7400, and I'm not willing to go back to $7200. I'm starting to think that maybe we're not a good fit for this deal. I'm going to think about other options."
"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $7200, but I need to get out of this negotiation and move on to other opportunities. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal now. If not, I'll have to consider other buyers. What do you say?",7200.0,Alice,9,,
