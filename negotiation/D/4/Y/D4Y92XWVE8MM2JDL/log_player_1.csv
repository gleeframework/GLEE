Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting close, but I still think I can get a bit more out of the deal. I'll counter his offer in round 5."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,950,000. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000.

While I could push for a little more, Bob has been consistently moving upwards, and we are getting into diminishing returns territory.  Accepting $1,850,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
