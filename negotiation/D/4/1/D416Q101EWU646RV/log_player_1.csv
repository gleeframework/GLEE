"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  There are more rounds left, and I can still counteroffer and potentially reach a higher agreement.  Selling to John now would be accepting the lowest possible price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I can offer $8,750 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating for a better price. I have several rounds left, and there's still a chance to reach a deal that benefits both of us. Selling to John now would be settling for the lowest price, and I'm determined to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and am willing to increase my offer to $8,850. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,850 is only $50 below my minimum desired price.  I've already rejected several offers and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer would secure a sale close to my minimum, which is better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $8,000."
