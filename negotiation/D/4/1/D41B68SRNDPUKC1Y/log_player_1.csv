"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would still leave you a substantial profit, and it's a price I'm confident I can justify. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident I can reach a deal that's closer to my desired range without resorting to selling to John."
