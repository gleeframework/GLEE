"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would still leave you a substantial profit, and it's a price I'm confident I can justify.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. If we can't reach an agreement here, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a little below my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm proposing a final price of $1,075,000. This ensures a good profit for me, while remaining a great value for you. It's a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
