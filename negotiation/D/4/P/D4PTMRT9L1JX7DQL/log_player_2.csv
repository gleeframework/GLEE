You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no incentive to accept it immediately. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significant counteroffer (25% lower than Alice's initial price) shows a willingness to negotiate and establishes a starting point for the bargaining process.  This allows room for potential compromise while still aiming for a significant price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, but you still have room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer. This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to achieve a price lower than $1,000,000.  It keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, accepting at $1,050,000 saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John.  This is a good compromise and a reasonable price given the negotiation progress.  There's always a risk of not getting a better deal, but the potential gain is relatively small compared to the price reduction already achieved."
