"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is still more than your $10,000 limit. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $10,500 for the product.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to get the price down as much as possible. While $11,000 is closer to your limit, you can likely get it even lower by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm offering $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're committed to negotiating, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,875 is getting closer to your limit, you're now in round 5. There are only 5 rounds left, and the potential for further negotiation is limited. At this point, buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you the product at your desired price and saves you time and further negotiations."
