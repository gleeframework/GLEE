"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is offering the product for $90. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $100 from John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the better choice."
