"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to leverage the fact that Bob is interested.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further.  However, if he accepts, I've secured a great deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $150 right now, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I could sell to John for $150, I'm  comfortable with this offer and want to close the deal."
