Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, we can start a back-and-forth.  But I also have the safety net of John's offer at $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still significantly above Bob's offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value.  $17,000 seems like a fair compromise that hopefully Bob will consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate further, as I could just sell to John for the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the $15,000 I need."
