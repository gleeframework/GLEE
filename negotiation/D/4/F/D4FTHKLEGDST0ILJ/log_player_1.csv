Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since I'm Alice, and I know I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, there's no incentive for me to lower the price for Bob. I'm going to offer the product at my minimum acceptable price. This way, if Bob accepts, I get the maximum profit, and if he rejects, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
