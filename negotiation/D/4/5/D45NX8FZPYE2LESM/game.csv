"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable with $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
