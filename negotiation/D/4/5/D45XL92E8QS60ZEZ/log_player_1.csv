Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm starting the price at $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, but still within a range that I think Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product is well worth it!"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm still being positive and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $97.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with his offer. It's below my minimum.  I believe I can push for a bit more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $102.50.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise by coming down slightly from my previous offer. I'm highlighting the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting closer, but Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've got 4 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $100 sale.  John is a safe bet, and I'm willing to take that."
