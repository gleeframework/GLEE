"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product is well worth it!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $97.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $102.50.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
