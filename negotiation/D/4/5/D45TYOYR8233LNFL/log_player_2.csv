"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $95? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'd like to reach your budget, $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $105 is still a good deal for Bob.**  It's significantly lower than John's price of $120, and Bob's goal is to save money. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it's also risky.** There's a chance Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob might end up paying John's full price. 
* **Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoids potential risk.**"
