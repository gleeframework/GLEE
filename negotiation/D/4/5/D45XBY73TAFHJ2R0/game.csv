"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. It's important for me to get a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
