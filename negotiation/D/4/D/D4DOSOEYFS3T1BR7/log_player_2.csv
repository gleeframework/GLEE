# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is attractive because it's significantly lower than what you're willing to pay. However, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit short of my target. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I could try to counteroffer again, it's getting risky. If I reject, she might push back further, and I could end up paying even more.  It's also possible that she might get impatient and decide to sell to John instead.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price."
