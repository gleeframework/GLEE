Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd sell to John, hoping to maximize my profit. Since Bob values the product at $100, he has room to negotiate, but I'm confident he'll see value in the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd sell to John or what I'd prefer to get.  I'll counter-offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still staying above what Bob offered and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this compromise will be attractive to Bob."

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is more than what I need to make a profit.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
