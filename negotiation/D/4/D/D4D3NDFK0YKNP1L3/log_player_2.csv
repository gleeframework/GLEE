"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and the opportunity cost of selling it to someone else.  Please let me know if you're interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. Alice is clearly trying to get a price significantly higher than its value to her ($800,000). By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price or you can purchase from John for $1,200,000."
