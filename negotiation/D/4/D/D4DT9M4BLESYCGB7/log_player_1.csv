Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

Since I know John is willing to pay $1,500,000, I'm going to offer Bob the same price. This maximizes my potential earnings, as I'll get the highest possible price regardless of whether Bob accepts or rejects.  While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, I'm not willing to lower the price, as I'm confident John will buy it for that amount."
