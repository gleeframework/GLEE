Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower and sticking to a firm limit is important in negotiation.  It's a better outcome to buy from John at the desired price."
