"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you considering your value, and it's the best I can do at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:** $11,000 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* **No guarantee of further price reduction:**  There's no certainty that Bob can negotiate a lower price. Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting Bob's offers, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a higher cost or losing the opportunity."
