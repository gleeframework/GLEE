Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, making Bob less likely to stall.

By aiming high, we increase the chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having the safety net of John's offer."
