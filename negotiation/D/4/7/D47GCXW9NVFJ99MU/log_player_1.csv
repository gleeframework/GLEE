"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see how willing he is to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating with him in the hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this price is a fair compromise and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price but shows a willingness to compromise further. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offers have been steadily increasing but still remain below my minimum acceptable price. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing if Bob continues to reject my offers.  Selling to John guarantees me a solid profit and allows me to move on."
