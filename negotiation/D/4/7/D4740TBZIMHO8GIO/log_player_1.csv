Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,500 feels fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you see the value, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 13750}"
