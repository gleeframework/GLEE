"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you see the value, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality.",13750.0,Alice,3,
