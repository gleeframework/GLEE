"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  It's important we find a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1325000. This gives us both a fair outcome and allows us to close the deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1300000. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my offer.  However, $1300000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1312500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. ",1312500.0,Alice,5,
