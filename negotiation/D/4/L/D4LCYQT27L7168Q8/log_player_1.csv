Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for the negotiations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget concerns."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree on a price higher than $950,000. Considering this, I would like to make a final counteroffer of $975,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number acceptable to me. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
