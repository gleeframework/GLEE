"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1200000? I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budgetary constraints.  While $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both a good starting point. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
