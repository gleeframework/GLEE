,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for your product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm eager to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal considering its value to you. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,875.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both reach an agreement. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer! However, $10,875 is still slightly over my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $10,800. This is a very fair price, and I truly hope we can reach a deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,6,
