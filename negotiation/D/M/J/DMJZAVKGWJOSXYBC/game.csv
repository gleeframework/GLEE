"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product.  I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
