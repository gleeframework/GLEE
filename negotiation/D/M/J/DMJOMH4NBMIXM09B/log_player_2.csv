"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's offer of $150, but still higher than your personal value of $150. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. You can then buy the product from John for $150, saving you $30 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
