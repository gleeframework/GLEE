"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,400,000 is still not enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,500,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
