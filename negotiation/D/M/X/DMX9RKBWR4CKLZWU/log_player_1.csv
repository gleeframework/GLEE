Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $120 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **First Offer Advantage:**  As the seller, setting the initial price higher gives you an advantage in the negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below your minimum if he truly values the product at $150."
