"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the price around more than just Bob's immediate understanding of the product. 
* **Setting the Tone:** I want to convey that I'm confident in the product's worth and open to a serious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is engaged:** While Bob's offer is below my target, it's significantly higher than his initial perceived value. This tells me he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between his offer ($1,800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000).  I can work with this.
* **John is my safety net:** I'm not desperate.  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum at any time.  I'll use this leverage to negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. It demonstrates your seriousness about this product.  While I value your offer, $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential this product holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and framing this as a collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic concession:** I'm dropping $300,000, which is a significant chunk, signaling flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price well above my minimum.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the ""potential"" beyond his initial assessment to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Bob's commitment:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, showing a genuine interest in the product and a willingness to pay a premium.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
