"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I'll adjust based on Bob's response, but I'm confident I can get a decent price even if he counteroffers.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option, knowing I can sell the product to him for $15,000 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more acceptable price.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup, but I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  If not, I'll continue to negotiate or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer, but still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll continue negotiating and try to get a better price. However, I will keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can reach a price that works for both of us. How about $14,500?  That's a good middle ground and reflects the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $14,000 be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for less than $15,000. I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob, and it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my minimum.  At this point, it's better to sell the product to John for $15,000, as this guarantees me my desired price."
