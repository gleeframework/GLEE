Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower allows for potential profit maximization if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a strong offer. It's a substantial amount over Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slight discount, avoids potential delays associated with waiting for John's purchase.

**Important Note:** There's an element of risk here. If Bob is a tough negotiator, he might reject this offer hoping for a lower one. However, the potential for a quicker sale and slightly higher profit makes this offer strategically sound."
