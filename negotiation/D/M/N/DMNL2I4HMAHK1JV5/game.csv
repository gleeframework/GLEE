"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to you. My asking price is $14,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and its potential benefits to your business. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $14,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your interest.  $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,750.  This would allow both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,750 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $13,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $13,600. This is a compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",13600.0,Alice,5,
