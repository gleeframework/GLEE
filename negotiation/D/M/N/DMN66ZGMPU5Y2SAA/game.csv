"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful it's a fair starting point for continued negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your increased offer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $980,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is a good offer, it's still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer you $960,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.",960000.0,Bob,6,
