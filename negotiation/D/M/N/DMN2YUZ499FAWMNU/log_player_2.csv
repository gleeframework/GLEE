"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this product. Our initial offer for the product is $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly below Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates his serious intent to buy but also sets a clear expectation of a lower price.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer, highlighting his budget limitations.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", Bob keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am prepared to consider an offer closer to your proposal. My counteroffer for the product is $825,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still a bit higher than his ideal price point.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since he has a fallback option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Counteroffer:** Bob is now offering his maximum budget, making it clear that this is his final offer.
* **Direct Language:**  He avoids ambiguity and uses direct language to emphasize the finality of his offer.
* **Focus on Budget:** Bob reinforces his budget limitations to justify his stance.
* **Decision Point:**  This counteroffer puts the ball in Alice's court. If she rejects it, Bob can move on to buying from John, ensuring he doesn't overpay."
