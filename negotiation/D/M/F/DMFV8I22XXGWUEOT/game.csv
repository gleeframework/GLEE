"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
