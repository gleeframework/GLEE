"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the product's true value to him. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000. Accepting John's offer ensures a good profit without the risk of prolonged negotiation."
