"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
