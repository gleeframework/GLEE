Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than the $150 value Bob places on the product, making it likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **It's a clear opening:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $110, which is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.  It also subtly reminds Bob of his initial interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you consider $105? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price.  It's definitely better than selling to John for $80.  While I'd ideally like to get $110, I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with nothing.  Accepting $105 is the best option at this point."
