"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly above Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  
* **Confident Tone:**  I want to convey that I believe in the product's value.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob's perspective to keep the dialogue open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately meeting my minimum suggests there's more room for negotiation. I'll aim slightly above my floor to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Stand Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but signal I'm not desperate by rejecting it outright. 
* **""Meet Halfway"" Tactic:** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to move closer to my position.
* **Highlight Value:** I reiterate the product's benefits to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** Bob is now offering a price above my minimum ($12,000) and very close to the midpoint between our initial positions. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results, and a deal in hand is better than the uncertainty of future offers. 
* **Building Rapport:** Accepting this offer shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, which can be beneficial for future interactions."
