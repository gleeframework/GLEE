"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $18000. Would you be willing to consider that?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $19000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your latest counteroffer! I'm still a bit far apart from your offer, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach an agreement. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,7,
