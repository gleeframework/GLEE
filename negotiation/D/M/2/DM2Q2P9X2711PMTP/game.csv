"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $725000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $675000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering a counteroffer of $700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",700000.0,Alice,5,
