"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,050,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
