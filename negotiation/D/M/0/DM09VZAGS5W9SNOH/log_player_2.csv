"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal to accept $1,200,000 when you can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice is getting closer to our price. We can try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,050,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to buy from John at $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation."
