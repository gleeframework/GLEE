"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000 to try and make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're coming up on your offer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
