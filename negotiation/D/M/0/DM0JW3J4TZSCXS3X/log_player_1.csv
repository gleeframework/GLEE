Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than Bob's perceived value, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for further negotiation while showing that I am willing to compromise."
