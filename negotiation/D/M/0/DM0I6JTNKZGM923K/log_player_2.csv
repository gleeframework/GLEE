"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation. This aggressive offer pushes Alice to consider a more substantial compromise.  The $950,000 price is still within Bob's budget, while leaving space for further negotiation should Alice reject the initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers and force Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a lower price than John's, securing a good deal."
