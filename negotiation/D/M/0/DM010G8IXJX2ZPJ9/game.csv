"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,200. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
