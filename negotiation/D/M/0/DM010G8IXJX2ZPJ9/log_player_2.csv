# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,200. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
