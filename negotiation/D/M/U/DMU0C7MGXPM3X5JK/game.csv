,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $750,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the market value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
