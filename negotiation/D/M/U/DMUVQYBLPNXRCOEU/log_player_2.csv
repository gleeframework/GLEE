"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. That's a great deal, and it gives us both a chance to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her at $10,000, I'll be paying $2,000 more than I need to, and I can get the same product from John for $8,000.
