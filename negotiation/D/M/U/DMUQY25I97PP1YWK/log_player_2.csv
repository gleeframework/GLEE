"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth more than what you're willing to pay, and we believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us to maintain a fair margin. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. There's room for negotiation to potentially save money. Rejecting her offer allows you to explore a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your financial constraints. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, her offer is still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting allows you to try a counteroffer closer to your desired $10,500. There's still potential for a deal to be reached within your budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's split the difference: I'll offer you $10,750.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to accept $10,875 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,875 is only $375 more than your last counteroffer of $10,500. This is a reasonable compromise, especially considering John is selling the product for $12,000. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product at a good price while saving $1,125 compared to buying from John."
