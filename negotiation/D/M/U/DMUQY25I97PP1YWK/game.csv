"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your financial constraints. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's split the difference: I'll offer you $10,750.  This allows us to both achieve a good deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
