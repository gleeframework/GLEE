Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he counter-offers, you know he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Safety Net:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
