"Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and getting back to me.  While your valuation is understandable, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and still provides you with substantial value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
