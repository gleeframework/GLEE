Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This creates room for negotiation while ensuring I still get a good price. 
* **Message:** This is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note and highlight the value proposition for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a good price while still being flexible.
* **Maintain leverage:** By having a backup buyer (John), I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  A slightly aggressive starting price encourages Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Potentially get a better offer:**  Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly after I reject his initial counter-offer.
* **Assess Bob's commitment:** If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to come up in price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range but still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $10,500 is a compromise, a midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). It's still a good price for me, considering my minimum is $15,000.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the value proposition of the product while maintaining a firm stance on my price. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still keeping my leverage. It also incentivizes Bob to come up a bit more in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be ready to negotiate further if needed. If his offer remains significantly lower than my minimum, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's close enough to my minimum value ($15,000) and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer ($8,000).  

Here's why accepting this offer is the best choice:

* **Good profit:** I'm still making a substantial profit on the sale.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer from Bob or a prolonged process.
* **Potential for future deals:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I keep a positive relationship with him, potentially leading to future business opportunities.

**Decision:**

Accepting this offer ensures a reasonably good deal, minimizing risks and potential losses associated with further negotiation."
