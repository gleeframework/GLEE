Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.

Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob again and try to get a higher price.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my goal or even secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000,  This price is a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I think $800,000 is a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price. I've been able to negotiate a decent price without having to sell to John, which means I get to keep the product in the same network. It's a win-win situation."
