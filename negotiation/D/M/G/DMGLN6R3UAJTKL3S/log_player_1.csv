Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since I'm not sure of the value of the product to Bob, I'll start with a relatively high price. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": 120}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and he's making a counteroffer of $100. Since $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, I think I'll take the deal!

I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:
