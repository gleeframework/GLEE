"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1400000. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my final offer.  If that's acceptable, we can finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product for $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
