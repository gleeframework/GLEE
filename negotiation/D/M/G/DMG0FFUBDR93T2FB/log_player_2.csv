"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns you'll see from it. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, though it's getting closer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product and the price John is offering.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand that this product has significant value, and $1,350,000 simply doesn't reflect that.  To move things along, I'll come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,600,000 is still too high. I'm not convinced it's her ""final offer,"" and I'm confident I can get a better price. It's also worth remembering that I can always walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  Given my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting a significant step towards meeting your needs while staying within my limits.  I hope we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
