Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer provides a good safety net. Let's see if we can bring Bob closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from this product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down a bit, the price is still too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but $2,000,000 is not feasible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is now a reasonable profit above John's offer. Accepting this offer avoids the risks of further negotiation and secures a good deal."
