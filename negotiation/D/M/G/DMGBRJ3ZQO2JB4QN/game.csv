"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay something closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down a bit, the price is still too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but $2,000,000 is not feasible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the product's worth.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
