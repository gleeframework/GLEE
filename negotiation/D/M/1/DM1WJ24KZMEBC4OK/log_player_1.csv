I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I have 8 more rounds to try."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still within striking distance of my target price of $1,400,000. I have 6 rounds left to try and close the deal at a more favorable price."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for $1,350,000, $1,300,000 is a good price and we're getting closer to a deal.  We only have 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a good price than to gamble on a better one that may never materialize."
