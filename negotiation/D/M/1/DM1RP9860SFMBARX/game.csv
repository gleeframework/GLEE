"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $80 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. This product is truly worth the value, and I could easily sell it for $100 to someone else. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $110, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we agree on that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
