"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,5,
