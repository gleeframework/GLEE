Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested and we can reach a mutually beneficial price. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if I don't think I can get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's offer was significantly lower than my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still higher than his offer."

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise,  lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but higher than Bob's latest offer."

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still higher than Bob's latest counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that shows my willingness to negotiate while still securing a good value for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is only slightly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. Given that further negotiation might be time-consuming and not guarantee a better outcome, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good deal and it secures a sale quickly."
