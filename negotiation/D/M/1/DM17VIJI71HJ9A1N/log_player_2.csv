"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's significantly lower than that. Let's discuss a price that benefits us both. What do you think about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is $50,000 less than what John is selling it for.
* **You still get a good deal:**  While Alice's offer is still above her valuation of $800,000, you are getting the product for less than your own valuation of $1,000,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
