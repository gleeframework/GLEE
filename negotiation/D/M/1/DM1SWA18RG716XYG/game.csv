"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $925,000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $880,000? That's a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
