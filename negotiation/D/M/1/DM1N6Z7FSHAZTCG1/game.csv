"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This would still provide you with a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $875000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll consider $887500. This is my final offer before I start to get concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
