"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's a negotiation tactic to start significantly lower than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and potentially secure a much better deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This low offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. She might accept a much lower price than her initial ask, especially if she's motivated to sell. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential savings while acknowledging that Alice's acceptance of this low offer is uncertain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $60, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $100 is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than both our budget ($80) and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there's room for further negotiation. We haven't reached a point where it's necessary to buy from John just yet. 

Let's see if we can bring the price down closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $100 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet closer to the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By suggesting $75, we're not simply splitting the difference between her current offer ($100) and our previous offer ($60). We're aiming slightly closer to our target price while still showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We don't want to jump to our maximum budget ($80) yet. Leaving some room allows for potential further negotiation if Alice is still resistant.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We should keep John's offer in mind. If Alice remains unwilling to move closer to $75, we can always walk away and buy from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $85, but I think it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. We've successfully negotiated her down, but she's reached a point where further concessions are improbable.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John offers the product for $80, which is a better deal than Alice's $85. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her raising the price again or reaching an impasse. It's not worth the extra time and potential frustration for a mere $5 difference.

It's been a good negotiation, but John's offer is the most financially sensible option at this point."
