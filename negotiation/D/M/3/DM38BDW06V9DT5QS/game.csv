"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while hopefully remaining within a range that works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,650,000. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,550,000. I believe this price is closer to what we can both agree upon.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
