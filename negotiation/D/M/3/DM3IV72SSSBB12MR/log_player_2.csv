# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

Let's start the negotiation. Alice's initial offer is too high."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,500 yet. I'm willing to come down another $250, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

Alice is negotiating, but it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $12,250. At this point, the potential savings aren't worth the continued negotiation. It's better to secure the product from John at the known $12,000 price."
