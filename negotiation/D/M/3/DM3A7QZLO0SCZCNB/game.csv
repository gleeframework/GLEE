"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to invest, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm ready to purchase the product for $10,500. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal and move forward.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11100.0,Alice,5,
