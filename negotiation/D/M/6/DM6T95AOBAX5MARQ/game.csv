"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I can tell we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
