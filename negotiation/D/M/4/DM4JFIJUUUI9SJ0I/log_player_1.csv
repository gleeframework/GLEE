Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he's not, I'm prepared to counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $18,000 is still a decent price, but I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $17,500 is still a good deal and  above my minimum threshold.  Further negotiation might result in a higher offer from Bob, but it also risks him walking away and forcing me to sell to John for a lower price. It's time to secure the sale."
