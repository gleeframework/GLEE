"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm looking to save some money here.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $85, but that's my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $77.50 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $81.25.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll be selling the product to another buyer.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still trying to save a bit more. Can you meet me at $79.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",79.5,Bob,6,
