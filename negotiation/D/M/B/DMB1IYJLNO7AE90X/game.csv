"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $600,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product, while also respecting my financial constraints. Let's find a way to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  Let's settle this â€“ I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to receive fair value for this product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to receive fair value, and I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
