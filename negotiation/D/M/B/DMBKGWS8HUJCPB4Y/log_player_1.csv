"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 
 
I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good profit.  I'm assuming Bob is interested but doesn't know the exact value, so I'm testing the waters.  This offer gives room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe there's potential for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a comfortable margin. I believe it's likely Bob will find this more appealing than the previous offer, but it's also within a range where I can still walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can't get much better than this. It's still a good profit, and I don't want to risk him walking away entirely.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
