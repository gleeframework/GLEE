"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be confident and set a high starting point to maximize profits.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to our minimum, it's still below what we'd like to get. We have more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose $800,000 as the price. This aligns closely with my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. Looking forward to your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is our minimum acceptable price. It's time to close the deal!  We've secured the value we set for the product, and further negotiation may only risk losing the sale."
