"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is quite significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  $1,210,000 is my final offer – it reflects the worth I believe this product holds for you.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
