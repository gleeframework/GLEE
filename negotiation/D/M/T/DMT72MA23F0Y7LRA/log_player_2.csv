"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice to start negotiations below your ideal target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating that it's outside your budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $1,050,000 puts some pressure on Alice. It's a significant jump down from her initial offer but still leaves room for her to counter if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($1,150,000) and my previous offer ($1,050,000). This is a common negotiation tactic and signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Moving Closer to Target:**  While still below my ideal price, $1,100,000 puts me in a good position. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with while leaving room for a final concession if needed.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The message remains polite and collaborative, emphasizing a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While not a perfect deal, $1,125,000 is a substantial savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice. She might dig in her heels, or I might have to concede even further. Accepting now guarantees a good price. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort.  The potential savings from pushing further are likely outweighed by the convenience of closing the deal now."
