"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
