"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I do like the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $157.50? That gives us both a fair deal. ",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
