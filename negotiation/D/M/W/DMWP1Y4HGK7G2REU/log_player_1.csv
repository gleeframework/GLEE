{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation and emphasizes the value of the product. This approach aims to maximize my profit while staying open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I do like the product, $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $157.50? That gives us both a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 157.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $157.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
