"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is still too high, and Bob can get the product for a lower price from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as she's clearly willing to lower the price, but if she doesn't get close to Bob's budget, there's no reason to keep negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This would represent a significant savings for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
