"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 4

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I think $775,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're very nearly at a deal here.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to work with you, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This is a critical point in the negotiation.  We're at Alice's likely breaking point, and it's time to hold firm and signal that this is our limit.  We'll see if she's willing to accept a smaller profit margin, or if we need to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counter with $815,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's worth considering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $815,000, and we've hit our absolute limit.  Taking John's offer ensures we get the product at the best possible price for us."
