"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price of $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair price that considers its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to at least recoup my minimum investment. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. How about we settle in the middle at $1,075,000?  This shows I'm willing to move closer to your price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise, and it's a price that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's aim for a final agreement this round.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This seems like a fair deal that allows both of us to feel good about the agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
