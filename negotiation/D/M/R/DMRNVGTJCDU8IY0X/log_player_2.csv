"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a price that allows for a healthy profit for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested. I'm confident you won't regret this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **It's within your budget.**  You are willing to spend up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.
* **Even though the price is higher than what the product is worth to Alice, it's a good deal for you.** You're still getting the product for less than your maximum price and saving $100,000 compared to buying from John."
