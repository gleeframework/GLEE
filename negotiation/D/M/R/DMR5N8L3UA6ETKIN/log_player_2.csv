"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my target profit. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 was a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise at $7,000. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $6,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Alice has come down to your maximum price, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate further.  You achieve your goal of getting the product at your target price."
