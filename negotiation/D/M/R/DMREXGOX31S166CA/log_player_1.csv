Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000? I believe this might be a more feasible figure for both of us.
