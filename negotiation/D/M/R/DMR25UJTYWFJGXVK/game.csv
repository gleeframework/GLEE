"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? This still gives you a significant advantage and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
