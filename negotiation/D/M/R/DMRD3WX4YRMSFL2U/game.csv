"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and would be a more reasonable ask.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and the return I'm seeking. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,300,000. This price takes into account the product's value, but also my budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
