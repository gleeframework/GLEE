"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first, as her product's worth to her ($800,000) is significantly less than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price of $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to understand her lower bound and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Let's try to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise but holds firm on achieving a price closer to our initial target. We're inching towards a potential agreement while still maintaining a buffer from John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $750,000, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  We're buying the product for $825,000, a saving of $175,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of Alice walking away. 

This deal represents a good balance between getting a competitive price and securing the product."
