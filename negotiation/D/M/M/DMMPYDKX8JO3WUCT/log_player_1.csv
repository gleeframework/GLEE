"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, the price you're offering is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

``` 

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is firmly rooted at $15,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result, and accepting his offer guarantees the same amount as John's standing offer."
