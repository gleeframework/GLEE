"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Is there any flexibility you can offer?",825000.0,Bob,4,
