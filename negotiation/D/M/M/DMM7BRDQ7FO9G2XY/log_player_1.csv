Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers.
* **Message:** This is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value Bob would receive.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:** I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum value while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I've left room for negotiation, knowing Bob might counteroffer.
* **Backup plan:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $850,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiating further:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a better price with Bob.  He's shown interest, and I can likely push him a bit higher. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me my desired $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand your budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? It's a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.  
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:**  The message stays positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Increase Pressure:** By counteroffering, I'm showing that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a low price. This might encourage Bob to be more flexible.
* **Balance:** I'm still keeping my minimum value in mind.  $875,000 is a good compromise without sacrificing too much. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go back to John as my backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Is there any flexibility you can offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is too low:** $825,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  It's clear that further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to lead to a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Time to cut losses:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a much lower price than I could get from John. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me the $1,000,000 I need, which is the best outcome at this point.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Negotiations with Bob are becoming too risky.  While I'm eager to get a good price, I'm not willing to risk settling for a significantly lower amount.
* **Protecting my interests:** Selling to John is the safest option, securing my desired profit and ensuring I don't lose out on a better deal."
