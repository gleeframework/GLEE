"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This offer is a good compromise that's closer to my budget and still recognizes the value of your product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,287,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
