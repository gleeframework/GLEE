"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to keep your investment within a budget, Bob. However, I have to say that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,,
