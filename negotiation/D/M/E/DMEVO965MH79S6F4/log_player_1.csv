Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my own resources.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 at this pace.  It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
