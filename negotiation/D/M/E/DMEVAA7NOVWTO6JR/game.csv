"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my minimum desired price but above your value. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $8,750?  It's a good middle ground and ensures both of us get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",8750.0,Alice,5,
