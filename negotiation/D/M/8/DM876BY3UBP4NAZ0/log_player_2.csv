(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a strong opening offer that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear boundary. It's possible Alice will reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I want to see if I can get her down even further, so I'll reject and try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000, which is still within my budget but closer to Alice's price point. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product and hopefully encourages Alice to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small counteroffer to Alice, increasing my previous offer by $25,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise slightly. I'm hoping this small increment will encourage Alice to accept, as we're now very close to each other's desired price points."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $940,000, I'm getting closer to my budget limit.  It's unlikely she'll come down further.  It's more advantageous to go with John's offer at $800,000 and secure a lower price."
