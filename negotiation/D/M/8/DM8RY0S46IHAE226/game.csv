"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a deal, that price undervalues the product's true potential for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,150,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'll make one more offer: $1,175,000. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
