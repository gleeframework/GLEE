"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'll try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is tempting, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still maintaining a profitable price for myself. I'm emphasizing the value of the product again to reinforce its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Can you meet me at $105? I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $105 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and still allows me to earn a decent profit. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the lower price from John. Accepting the offer guarantees a sale at a reasonable price."
