"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $8,500, which is still a fantastic price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can make this work.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Buying from John ensures he gets the product within his budget."
