Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows me to earn more than my minimum price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum price of $80, and it's a good compromise considering my initial offer was rejected. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product for $90."
