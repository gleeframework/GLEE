"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a good starting point, but $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $500000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $600000. Let's try to bridge the gap.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $600000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $650000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Alice,5,
