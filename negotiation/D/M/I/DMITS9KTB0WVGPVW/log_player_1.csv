"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Open-ended question:**  I encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation by asking for his opinion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also lower than my initial offer.
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 9 rounds remaining, so I can continue to negotiate with Bob without risking losing too much time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for something closer to $11,000. I'm confident this product is worth the investment for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but also not going back to my initial price.  I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Collaborative tone:** I'm emphasizing finding a price that works for both of us, encouraging Bob to see this as a partnership."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, I still have several rounds left and can potentially get closer to my ideal price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, which allows for further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, so I can continue to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. $10,200 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get $10,500 for it. I believe this product will generate significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small incremental increase:** I'm increasing my counteroffer by a small amount, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I'm not giving in too quickly.
* **Focus on value and benefits:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's potential value and emphasizing the mutual benefits of reaching a deal.
* **Collaborative tone:**  I'm reiterating that we can find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are halfway through the negotiations and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob keeps offering lower prices, making it seem unlikely we will reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity cost:**  I'm risking losing time and potentially a better deal with John if I continue negotiating with Bob.

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation that may lead to a lower outcome."
