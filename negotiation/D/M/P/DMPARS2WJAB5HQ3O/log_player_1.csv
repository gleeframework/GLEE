"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."

Round 4

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $9000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This price is fair, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6

While I would like to get a slightly higher price, it seems like Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'll take that deal to ensure I get my minimum price."
