"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down to something closer to $8,500.  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",8800.0,Alice,3,
