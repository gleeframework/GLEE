"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1800000. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1900000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1900000. I'm willing to go up to $1700000, but I really need to keep the price as low as possible. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to keep costs down, but $1700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1800000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product. Let's close this deal and get you on your way to success.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1800000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go up to $1750000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
