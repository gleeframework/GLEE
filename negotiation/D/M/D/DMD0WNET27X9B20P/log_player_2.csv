Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we cannot accept your offer of $600,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We understand that you're trying to get closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, we're still not willing to go below $1,000,000. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $850,000. This is our final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially missing out on John's deal."
