# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to make a slight concession to make it more attractive to you. What do you think?
