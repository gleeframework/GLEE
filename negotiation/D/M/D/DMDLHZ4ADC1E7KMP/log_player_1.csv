"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for negotiation."",
""product_price"": 925000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to the desired price point. We still have room to negotiate and can leverage John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 within the remaining rounds.  John's guaranteed offer ensures we don't lose out on the product's baseline value. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and move forward with John."
