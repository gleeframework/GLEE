"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $950,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects its worth while remaining within my financial range. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move to $900,000 to try and find common ground.  This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a strong price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
