"I understand you've done your research, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
