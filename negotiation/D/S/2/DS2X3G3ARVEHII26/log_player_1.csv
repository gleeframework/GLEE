"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not excessively so. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially earn a profit. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob in my message to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive and leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer is exactly at the product's value to him.  This means he's not willing to pay more, and I need to push for a better deal.
* **No Need to Settle:** I have 9 rounds left. Selling to John right now would only get me my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Next Round:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still within a reasonable negotiation range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not too drastically. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have 8 rounds remaining, giving me some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Bob's offer is still lower than I'd like, it's closer to my desired price than before.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I have 7 rounds left, and the gap between our prices is narrowing. There's still potential to reach a more favorable deal.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John now would only get me the minimum.  I want to see if I can push Bob further before resorting to that. 
* **Next Round:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to lower the price, but still holding out for a decent profit. 
* **Appealing to Logic:**  I'm appealing to Bob's logic by pointing out that the price reflects the value while also fitting within his budget.
* **Remaining Rounds:** We're halfway through the negotiations, so there's still time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Balancing Act:** I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away. I'm trying to find a middle ground that will keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Selling to John now would guarantee me my minimum, but I'm not convinced Bob won't come up further.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 5 rounds left. This gives me a decent amount of time to see if I can push Bob to my desired price point.
* **Next Round:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000. I need to show I'm serious about getting as close to my desired price as possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a final push towards my desired price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to get serious about a deal.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm again emphasizing fairness, highlighting the value of the product and the progress we've made in negotiations.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize the deal to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm taking a calculated risk. While I'm closer to my minimum, I still have some wiggle room if Bob needs to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only three rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. 
* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer has not improved significantly from the previous round, indicating a stalemate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a significant risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. Selling to John now guarantees me the minimum price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** I can't afford to risk another rejection and potentially end up with nothing.

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John at this point is the most sensible option to secure a sale and avoid losing out entirely."
