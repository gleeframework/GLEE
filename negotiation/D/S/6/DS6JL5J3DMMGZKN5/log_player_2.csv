"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $150 is above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  You have the option to go to John, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $60 drop from Alice's original offer is a significant reduction, but it's still within the realm of possibility. 
* **Sets a clear price point:**  You're establishing your maximum price, making it clear that you're serious about buying but won't go any higher.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust this offer depending on Alice's response, but starting lower allows for some back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. I'm willing to come down to $120 for this product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $120 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** You have more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice might come down further.
* **John is still a backup:** Having John as an option provides you with leverage and flexibility during negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to buy if you can come down to $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is your maximum budget, and it's important to be firm about it. 
* **Clear and concise:**  You're stating your price point clearly and highlighting the benefit to both parties.
* **Creates pressure:** Alice knows you have a backup option, so this counteroffer increases the urgency for her to accept."
