"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $1,100,000.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $1,100,000, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to see if Alice will budge, and if not, I can always go with John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is closer to my desired price. However, John is offering the product for $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I can secure a better deal from John right now."
