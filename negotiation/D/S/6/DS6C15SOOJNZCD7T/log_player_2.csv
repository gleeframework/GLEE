"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120 from John, you can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have room to offer a lower price, as your maximum is $120 and Alice's minimum is $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's below Alice's asking price of $115, but still above her minimum of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $117 is still above my ideal price, it's better than the $120 I would pay to John. Given that Alice already rejected my counteroffer, I believe further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price. It's more efficient to accept this offer and secure the product."
