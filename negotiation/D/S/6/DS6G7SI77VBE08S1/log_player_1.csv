Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, great! If he counters, you know he's interested but wants to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
