"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $95 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now. How about we split the difference and go with $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $100 to $95, and now I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. I think you'll really enjoy the product, and I'm confident it's worth it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and we have 7 rounds left to negotiate. While John's offer is always an option, there's still room to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $92.50 is still above my target. I'm happy to meet you at $91. Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $92, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $92.25? It's a compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting close to her minimum price, and we're down to only 5 rounds left. While we could keep negotiating, it's likely that Alice will continue to be stubborn and we might end up with a price closer to $92. Additionally, John's offer is always an option, so accepting this offer ensures a decent deal with a lower price than John."
