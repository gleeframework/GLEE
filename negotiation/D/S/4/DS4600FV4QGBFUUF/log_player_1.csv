Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob:** Gets a $100,000 discount from the product's value to him.
    * **Alice:** Earns a $100,000 profit compared to selling to John. 
* **Urgency & Scarcity:** By mentioning another offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
