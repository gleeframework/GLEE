"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also considering my costs. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
