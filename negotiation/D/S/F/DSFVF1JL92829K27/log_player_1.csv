Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John offers the full value, there's no risk of selling below your minimum. The goal is to get as much from Bob as possible.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to make a good deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to accept."
