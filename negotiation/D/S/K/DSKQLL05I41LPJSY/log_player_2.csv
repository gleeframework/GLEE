"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be much more affordable. How about we start at $500,000?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $500,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I can offer you $650,000.  That's a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is still far below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more.  How about $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $725,000 is still well below the value I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits you'll receive.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000. She's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but her price drops are getting smaller. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
