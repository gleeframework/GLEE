"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting out of the sale.",155.0,Alice,5,
