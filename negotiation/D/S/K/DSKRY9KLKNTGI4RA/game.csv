"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $700,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $600,000 is still too far below what I need to sell.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $650,000.  This allows you to get a good price, and allows me to get closer to my target.",650000.0,Alice,5,
