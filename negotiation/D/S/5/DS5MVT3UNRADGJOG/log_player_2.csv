You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is willing to come down significantly from her original price. While you could try to push for an even lower amount, accepting $10,500 is a good deal and avoids the risk of her retracting the offer. It's better to secure a saving of $500 than potentially lose it by pushing too hard."
