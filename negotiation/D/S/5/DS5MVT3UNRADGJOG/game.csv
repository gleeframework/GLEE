"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
