Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's always worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 positions it attractively for Bob:
    * He gets a $400,000 discount from your ""minimum.""
    * He gains $400,000 in value compared to his own valuation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy aims to balance risk and reward for the highest potential gain."
