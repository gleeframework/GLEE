Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" you aim to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a higher level.
* **Openness:** While starting high, it's essential to signal willingness to negotiate. This prevents alienating Bob and encourages him to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gradually lower the price while keeping Bob engaged and aiming for a final price significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. However, always be prepared to walk away and take John's offer if the negotiations aren't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value, it's still considerably below your target and what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation. 

**Next Step:**  You should counter-offer with a price lower than your initial offer but still well above Bob's. Aim for somewhere between $1,900,000 and $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but $1,800,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,950,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Acknowledging Bob's offer and moving down shows you're negotiating in good faith.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing a price directly in the middle of the previous offers is a common negotiation tactic. It can feel like a fair compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** You're still holding firm above Bob's valuation while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has decreased his offer, and it's getting close to John's offer.  While you've left some room to go lower than John's offer, continuing to go back and forth with Bob has diminishing returns. It's time to send a final offer, making it clear you're prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your latest offer carefully. To be transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,500,000.  I value our discussions and believe this product has great potential for you, so I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,850,000. This is the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Alternatives:**  Letting Bob know about John's offer creates urgency and demonstrates you're serious about your bottom line.
* **Final Offer:**  By explicitly stating this is your final offer, you signal that further negotiation is unlikely. 
* **Leaving Some Value for Bob:** While close to your fallback option, the price is still above Bob's perceived value and leaves him with some potential upside.

**Outcome:** This strategy puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He can either accept a price significantly higher than he initially valued the product for, or you move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about having another buyer, and I understand your willingness to make one final offer. However, $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not significantly moved from his previous offer, and it remains below your guaranteed sale price with John.  

* **Staying Firm:** You presented a strong final offer and Bob didn't meet it. Accepting a lower price would set a bad precedent for future negotiations. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob has a cost, as it delays you from securing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

**It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed sale.**"
