Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your honest feedback. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.
