Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $165. Would you be willing to accept that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to make a sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $155 and it's not worth risking missing out on the deal entirely. John's offer of $150 is the best option at this point."
