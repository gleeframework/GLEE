"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You can get the product for a price you're comfortable with by rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John."
