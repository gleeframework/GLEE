"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $900,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would give you a solid profit and leave me with a good deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
