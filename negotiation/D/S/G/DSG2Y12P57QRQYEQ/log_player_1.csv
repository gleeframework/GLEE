"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my starting point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good price. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, which can make him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 (John's offer), it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I believe we can still negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $10,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's still below what I believe I can get. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I think I can push him a little further.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,500 still isn't quite where I need to be. Let's compromise - how about $10,800? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $10,400 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,400 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it's still not enough. We've been going back and forth, and it feels like we're getting stuck. I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to reach a deal that works for both of us. Given that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to take the guaranteed sale and sell the product to John. It's not ideal, but it's the best outcome given the circumstances."
