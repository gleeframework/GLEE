Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message to build rapport, and sets a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive to him.  It also leaves room for negotiation, which is important in this scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $78. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we compromise at $82?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I still want to give you a chance. How about we meet at $80? I really like the product and I'm willing to pay the lowest price I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $80 is close to your minimum, it's still not ideal.  John is offering you your minimum, and it's better to secure that guaranteed sale than to continue potentially losing more money with Bob."
