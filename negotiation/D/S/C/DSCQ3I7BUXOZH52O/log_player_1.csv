I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and hopefully entices Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get more than the $1,000,000 from John, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if his counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it will entice Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is too low.  While I'd prefer to get a better price, I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially getting an even lower offer.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point.  It guarantees I get my minimum, and I can move on to other potential buyers."
