"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Alice,5,
