"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $5,000 is far too low for me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $7,000? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, $7,000 is still not a good enough price for me. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 7500}
