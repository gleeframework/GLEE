"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has valuable features, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your true target. This leaves room for movement and signals I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:**  My offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial ask. This is intentional to gauge her flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Not Too Low:** While I start low, $1,000,000 is still a respectable offer that might pique Alice's interest, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair valuation considering the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute lowest price, as I have another buyer ready at this amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still $300,000 above my maximum budget. 
* **Possible Bluff:** Her mention of another buyer at that price could be a negotiating tactic.  I'm willing to call her bluff, at least for one more round.
* **John's Price:** I have a solid backup option with John at $1,200,000. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could make a move up to $1,100,000, but that's the best I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Slowly:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate by increasing my offer. However, the increase is relatively small, signaling that I'm still looking for a significant discount.
* **Below Her ""Lowest"":** My offer is still below her stated ""lowest price."" This tests her resolve and whether that other buyer is real. 
* **Nearer My Limit:** This offer is getting closer to my absolute limit (considering John's price). I need to be careful not to go too high, too quickly."
