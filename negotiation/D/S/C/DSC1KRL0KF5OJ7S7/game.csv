"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has valuable features, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,800,000 represents a fair valuation considering the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute lowest price, as I have another buyer ready at this amount.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could make a move up to $1,100,000, but that's the best I can do at this time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
