Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how to approach this negotiation as Alice:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 could work.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the highest price within the ZOPA. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start high but within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** You vaguely mention ""unique value"" to pique his interest without revealing your bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While a strong opening, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away if he's not willing to meet you near your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyers:** Mentioning John could potentially push Bob to accept your initial offer, but it also risks revealing your safety net.
