"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000, a $2,000 discount from its true value. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, it's clear she's using some sales tactics to inflate the perceived value.  You have a backup option to buy from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can gauge if she's willing to go lower or stick to John as a reliable, if slightly more expensive, option."
