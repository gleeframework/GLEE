"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $16,500.  This is a fair price considering its worth and potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts. ",16500.0,Alice,1,
