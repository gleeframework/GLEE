"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value you've indicated and allows us to both walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $10,750. This shows my willingness to compromise, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,
