"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $13,000 for the product.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11,500 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the benefits it brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate with me. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $11,000.  Would you consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,000 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
