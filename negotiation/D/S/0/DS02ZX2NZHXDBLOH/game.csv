"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. This is my final offer. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
