"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards your target price without needing to go to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a bit steep.  I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $650,000."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates bargaining space.  While $650,000 is a big difference, it leaves room to negotiate upwards and still be well below your $800,000 maximum.
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer sets a lower ""anchor"" price in Alice's mind. Even if she rejects it outright, it makes it psychologically harder for her to hold out for prices close to her initial $900,000. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This aggressive counteroffer will give you valuable information about how much Alice is willing to budge. Her response will indicate if a deal is possible within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice meeting you halfway is a good sign. It shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** While $750,000 is closer, it's still above your ideal price. You have room to push for a better deal.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** You still have the option to go with John for $800,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $800,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet that price?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Honest:**  Being upfront about your budget limits gamesmanship and can build trust.
* **Fair Deal:** This price gives Alice a significant profit over her valuation while staying within your limit. 
* **Time Pressure:** As you get closer to the 10-round limit, putting your best offer forward encourages Alice to decide quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice seems unwilling to budge below your $800,000 limit. Continuing the negotiation could waste valuable rounds.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. There's no point risking a higher final price with Alice. 
* **Time Value:**  Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little further, it might not be worth the additional time and effort."
