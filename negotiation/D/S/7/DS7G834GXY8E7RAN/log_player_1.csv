Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** Starting at $20,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
