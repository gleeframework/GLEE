"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need to get. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
