"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm still a little hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is closer to my budget and reflects the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
