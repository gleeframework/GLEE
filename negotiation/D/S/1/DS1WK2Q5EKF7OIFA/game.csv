"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm looking to save as much as possible. Can you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $85, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Is that something you'd consider?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure $95 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?,90.0,Bob,6,
