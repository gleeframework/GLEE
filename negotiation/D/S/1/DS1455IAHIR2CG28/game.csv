"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
