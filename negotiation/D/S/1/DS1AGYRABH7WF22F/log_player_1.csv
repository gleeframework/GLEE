This offer leaves some room for negotiation, while still giving me a healthy profit.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value to me while also allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
