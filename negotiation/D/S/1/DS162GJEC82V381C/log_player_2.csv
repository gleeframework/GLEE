"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for less than $100 from Alice, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate further and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you would prefer a lower price, $95 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product without further negotiation."
