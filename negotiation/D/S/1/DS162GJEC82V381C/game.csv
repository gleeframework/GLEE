"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",95.0,Alice,5,
