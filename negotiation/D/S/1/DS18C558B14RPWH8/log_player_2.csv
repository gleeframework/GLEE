"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $950,000? I think this is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, but also recognizes the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $950,000 and is only making small concessions. It's unlikely she'll drop to a price that beats John's offer of $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed lower price."
