"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring options before making a decision, especially when you have a backup like John's offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my interest.  However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for 1075000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While John's offer is still lower, Alice's counteroffer is within a reasonable range, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that is acceptable to you."
