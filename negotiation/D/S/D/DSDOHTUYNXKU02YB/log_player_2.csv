You can do better than $100. It's worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

You can still do better than $92.5.  Alice is willing to sell it for less than that. Keep negotiating!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell it to you for $92. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Alice has come down to $92, which is still a good price for you. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll have to buy from John for a higher price. It's better to lock in this deal and save money."
