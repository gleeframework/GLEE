"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start at $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking for something closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing appreciation for the discount.  It then directly states Bob's desired price point of $100, and offers a compromise at $105. This approach is a balance between showing good faith and pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find common ground. How about $110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It offers a specific price increase from Bob's previous offer, suggesting a genuine attempt to find a middle ground.  The message also expresses readiness to close the deal, potentially encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, how about we settle at $112 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved up from her previous offer, but still remains above Bob's target of $100.  Given that Bob has already made several counteroffers and there are only a few rounds remaining, it's highly likely that Alice will not budge further. It's therefore in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John at the guaranteed $100 price point to save money and avoid further negotiation."
