"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. To be frank,  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This recognizes the value of the product while still providing you with a significant return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I still need it to be a little lower. How about $1,075,000? "", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the immense value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $375,000 less than John's price and $175,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Alice's Firm Stance:**  Her language (""final offer,"" ""need you to meet me halfway"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the potential for more savings, but also risks Alice walking away or you running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price."
