"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. To be frank,  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This recognizes the value of the product while still providing you with a significant return.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I still need it to be a little lower. How about $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the immense value this product will bring to your business.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
