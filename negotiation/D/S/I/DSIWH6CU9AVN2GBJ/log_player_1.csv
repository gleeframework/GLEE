"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of value.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** While we want to maximize profit, starting too high (e.g., $1,450,000) could discourage Bob from negotiating altogether.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him. 
 
This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's initial reaction and adjust our approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer, while significantly lower than our initial ask, is still well above our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a better outcome. Selling to John at this stage would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer. To be frank,  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This recognizes the value of the product while still providing you with a significant return."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Stand Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, but we don't drastically drop our price. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing technique encourages compromise and can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Emphasize Value and Return:** We reiterate the product's worth to Bob, subtly anchoring his perception of its value. 
 
We are aiming for a price above $1,100,000. By making a relatively aggressive counteroffer, we signal our seriousness while leaving room for further concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I still need it to be a little lower. How about $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. We're still significantly above our minimum, and accepting now would leave potential profit untapped.  We'll make another counteroffer, applying a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the immense value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Create Urgency:** By introducing a ""final offer,"" we inject a sense of urgency into the negotiation, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Concession with a Caveat:** We make a small concession but frame it as our final move, putting the onus on Bob to agree or risk losing the deal.
* **Reiterate Value:**  We remind Bob once again about the product's benefits, solidifying its worth in his mind.

We're aiming for a price above $1,100,000. This approach balances firmness with flexibility and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement in our desired range."
