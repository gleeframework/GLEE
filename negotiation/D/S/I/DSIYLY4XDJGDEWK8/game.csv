"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  How about $106? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $109. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase.",109.0,Alice,5,
