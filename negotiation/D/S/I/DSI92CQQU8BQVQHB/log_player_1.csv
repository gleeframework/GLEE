"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This is a substantial compromise, but it's still a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting. I will reject his offer and try to close the deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  At this point, I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  There's a good chance I can get a slightly better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to close the deal with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $1,450,000.  This is only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this will convince him to close the deal."
