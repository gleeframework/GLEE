Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about $8,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500, which is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  It makes more sense to buy from John at this point to maximize savings."
