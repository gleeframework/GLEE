"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
