"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'd like to accommodate you, I must respectfully decline your offer. I believe the true value of the product is closer to $15000 based on its quality and benefits. However, I am willing to consider a compromise. How about we aim for a price of $13500? I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
