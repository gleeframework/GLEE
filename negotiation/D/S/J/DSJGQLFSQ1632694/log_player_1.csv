"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If he rejects, I'll assess his interest level and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a profitable price. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low. Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, but if he rejects again, I'll start seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  I'm getting a little nervous that Bob might not be serious about buying at all. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get more than $1,000,000, I'm not confident that I'll reach a deal with Bob before the deadline.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
