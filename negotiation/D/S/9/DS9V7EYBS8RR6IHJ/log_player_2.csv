"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I'm willing to compromise at $115, but I'm not going any lower than that. I think you'll really enjoy this product and it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $115 is still within Bob's budget of $150.**
* **The product is worth $100 to Alice, so $115 is a reasonable compromise.**
* **Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or Bob having to pay the full $150 to John.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to get the product at a good price without risking a worse outcome."
