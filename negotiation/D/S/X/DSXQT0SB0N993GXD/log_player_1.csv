"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation as it's lower than Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,200. This is a slight increase from his offer, but it still gives him a good deal while also getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous offer, but it's still below my desired price.  I believe there's more room for negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for $10,900 just yet. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,100.  This is a small increase from his offer, but it's still a good deal for him, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  I think we're getting close to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer has decreased significantly, and I'm starting to feel like he's not really interested in making a deal. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing is high.  To guarantee I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
