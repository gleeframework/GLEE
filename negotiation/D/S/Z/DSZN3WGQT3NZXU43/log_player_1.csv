Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a significant amount. I'll consider my options:

* Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for $750,000, which is lower than its value to me. I'd earn $150,000 less than I wanted.
* Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would give me a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. However, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and walk away.
* Selling the product to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed deal, and I'd earn the full value of the product.

Considering the options, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'll offer it to him for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This counteroffer is slightly higher than Bob's original offer, but still lower than my initial price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is now at the same price as what John is willing to pay. I've already considered selling to John, and I know I'll earn the full value of the product. Bob's offer is still lower than my initial price, but I've already invested time and effort into negotiating with him.

Considering the options:

* Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for $800,000, which is the same as what John is willing to pay. I'd earn the full value of the product, and I wouldn't have to worry about Bob rejecting any further offers.
* Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would give me a chance to try to get an even better price, but there's a risk that Bob might reject it and walk away.
* Selling the product to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed deal, and I'd earn the full value of the product.

Given the circumstances, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $800,000."
