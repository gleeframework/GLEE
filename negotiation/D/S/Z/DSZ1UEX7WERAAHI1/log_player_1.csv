{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a steal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a decent profit while still offering Bob a good price. It's above his perceived value, but not so high that he's likely to immediately reject it.  It's a strategic balance between maximizing profit and getting a deal done."
