You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for you, you can likely get it for a lower price. You should counteroffer and see if Alice will negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $900,000? It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is closer to your ideal price, you can still do better.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer again and potentially land a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000.  Let's try $890,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to your maximum budget. While you can technically reject the offer and make another counteroffer, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further.  It's more strategic to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that's still favorable to you."
