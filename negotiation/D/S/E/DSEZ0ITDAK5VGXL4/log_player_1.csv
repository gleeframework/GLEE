Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring Alice a significant profit above her minimum. 
* **Confidence and Justification:** The message implies that the product is worth the asking price, which might make Bob more receptive.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a much higher profit than selling to John."
