Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I reject Bob's offer because I can sell to John for the same price.  I will use the next round to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to lower my offer to $1,300,000,  which still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1250000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. This is the highest offer I've received so far, and it's just above my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price in future rounds, there's no guarantee, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
