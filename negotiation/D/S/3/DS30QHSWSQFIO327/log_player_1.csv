"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves me room to adjust my price if needed and avoids a quick rejection. 
* **Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would leave me with a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I have 8 rounds left to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always go to John if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Round:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us to reach a deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but within a reasonable range for negotiations. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and focusing on finding a solution that benefits both parties. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** This price leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my target, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left to try and reach a better price. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher offer.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer because I know I can get my minimum price from John.

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than his current offer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum but leaves room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,350,000 to $1,325,000, showing a genuine willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,325,000 is still above Bob's offer but closer to my desired outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and encouraging Bob to close the deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly highlighting the limited time left in the negotiation, hoping to push Bob toward an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will continue to negotiate, but I will be more cautious about lowering my price. I will also be more likely to consider John's offer if Bob continues to be inflexible."
