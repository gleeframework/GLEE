"Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a significant discount, and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value I place on your product. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
