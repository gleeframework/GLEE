"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).** 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John means you'll spend more, but it's still within your budget.**
* **You'll save money compared to accepting Alice's offer.**

Since your goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy even though it means spending more."
