"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $11,625. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",11625.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,625. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $11,500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,6,
