Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still lower than what I want. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but we're getting closer. I'm going to try to push for a higher price one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $11,625. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,625. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $11,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been pushing for a higher price, but Bob seems firm on his offer.  We're getting close to my minimum, but it's not worth risking the deal falling apart with only a few rounds left. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a better profit."
