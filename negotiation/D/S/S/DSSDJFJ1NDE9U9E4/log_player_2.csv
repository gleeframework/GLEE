"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm starting with a price of $900,000. I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it can bring.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price is within my range and reflects the value I see in it. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for us both to gain from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $850,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  Since Bob has 7 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to his target. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price represents a fair value for the product, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
