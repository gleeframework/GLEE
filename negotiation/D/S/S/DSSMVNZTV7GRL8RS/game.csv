"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a way to make this deal work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
