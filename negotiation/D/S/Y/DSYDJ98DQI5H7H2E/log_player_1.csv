Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get more. $10,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to the $12,000 I initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to come up a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're eager to close the deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10800}
