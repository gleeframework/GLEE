{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is below the minimum value for me, but it gives Bob some wiggle room to negotiate, and it's still a good deal for him, considering it's worth $80 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
