"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I recognize its potential value, the current price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  Let me know what you think.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,850,000 is still more than I had in mind.  To be fair, I can increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents the very top end of my budget, but I believe it's a fair offer considering market value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
