Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, as you know the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if needed, and still secure a profit above your minimum. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,000,000. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'd need a price closer to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and it seems like he's not willing to go much higher. Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale and a profit, which is better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal at all."
