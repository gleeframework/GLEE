"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower. There's no harm in trying to negotiate further, especially since you have 10 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's likely she'll reject this, but it will hopefully set the stage for a more agreeable price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price, given that I have several rounds left and the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round to $10,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but am still pushing for a lower price. It's a middle ground between our previous offers and hopefully, will be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my counteroffer, and I'm happy to accept it. $10,500 is a great price for the product, and I've managed to save $4,500 from John's offer.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, as I've already secured a good deal."
