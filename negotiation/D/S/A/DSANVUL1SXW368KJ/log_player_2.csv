{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worthwhile to accept. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's my best chance of getting a deal that works for me. I'm hoping Alice sees the value in selling to me rather than going through the hassle of finding another buyer, especially since I'm already willing to pay her the maximum I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident that I can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,200,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer.  I believe this is a fair price, considering Alice has lowered her price and I'm still willing to pay a premium compared to John's offer.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget.  It's tempting to accept since it's close to my limit, but I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be more flexible in the next round as I'm showing a willingness to compromise. If she rejects my next offer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than John's offer. I'm hoping that Alice will recognize my willingness to compromise and meet me halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we've been going back and forth for a while. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating, but the risk of Alice rejecting my next offer is high.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
