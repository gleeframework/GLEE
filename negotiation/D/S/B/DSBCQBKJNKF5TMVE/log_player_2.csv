"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $130, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $100 valuation as possible.  Offering $115 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is still too low for me. How about $120? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer of $120 is higher than Bob's ideal price of $115, it's still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum price of $150. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price, minimizing the risk of a further negotiation breakdown."
