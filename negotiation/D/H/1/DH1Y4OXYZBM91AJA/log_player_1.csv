Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

I want to see if I can get a higher price than John's offer.  Bob is showing interest, and I think I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $1,000,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,025,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $975,000, I'm still within the range of John's offer of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob is offering $990,000, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a secure option, and I'm happy to accept it."
