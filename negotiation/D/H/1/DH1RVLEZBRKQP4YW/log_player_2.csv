"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay, you can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's a significant difference between Alice's offer ($1,200,000) and your maximum price ($1,500,000), so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than your valuation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?  This price still provides you with a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and it's a fair deal for me. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer saves you $400,000 compared to buying from John. There's a good chance you won't be able to get a significantly better price through further negotiation."
