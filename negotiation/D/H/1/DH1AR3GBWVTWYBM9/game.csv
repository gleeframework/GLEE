"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's my final offer. If you're not able to meet this, I'll have to accept John's offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
