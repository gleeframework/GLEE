"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$750,000 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it lower. It's too early to buy from John at $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see how far she's willing to go.  I'm hoping she'll counter with something closer to my offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good, but $600,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but still pushing for a price closer to my initial counteroffer. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without risking her walking away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit high. We've established a range now, and I want to continue trying to push for a lower price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  This is getting closer to her last offer, and I hope we can find a middle ground.  I'm still hoping to avoid buying from John, but I'm getting closer to that point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting close to the point where buying from John becomes the better option.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but the price is still high.  $650,000 is a reasonable price, and it's better than risking the negotiation falling apart and being forced to pay $1,500,000 to John."
