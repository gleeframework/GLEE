"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a better price.  While $900,000 is a good deal, you could potentially get it for even less by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate, as your maximum budget is $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my interest in buying the product but also my willingness to negotiate. I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for me.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll either reject my next counteroffer or I might end up paying more than $850,000 in the end. Buying from John would be significantly more expensive.  It's time to lock in this price and avoid further potential complications."
