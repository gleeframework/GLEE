"I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I've already told you that I won't sell it to you for less than $120, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower. But I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer of $130. I'll sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I can offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
