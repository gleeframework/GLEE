Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $130. What do you think?

While Alice is negotiating, I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price point. I'll make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already told you that I won't sell it to you for less than $120, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower. But I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer of $130. I'll sell it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I can offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's within my budget.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price, and continuing might mean losing the deal."
