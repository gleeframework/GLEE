Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'll try to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is still too low. I'm going to counter with $950,000. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must respectfully decline at $950000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  I'm comfortable accepting $900,000, as it's significantly higher than what John is offering."
