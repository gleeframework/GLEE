"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price that I think is a great value for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity, but my budget allows me to only spend up to $8,000. Would it be possible for you to consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit, and $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm grateful for your response, Alice. While I understand your need for a profit, I still believe the product's value doesn't justify the $10,000 price point. Could we possibly negotiate down to $9,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $10,250? This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $10,250 is slightly above what I'm comfortable spending. Could we perhaps aim for $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise, allowing us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $500. This way, you'll get the product and some additional benefits. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm appreciative of the additional value you're offering, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $9,500 for the product, without the extra service package? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000. However, I'm willing to throw in the premium service package again, and I'll also include a 2-year warranty, which is a $1,000 value. This way, you'll get the product, the premium service, and the warranty. I think this is a very competitive offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm grateful for your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I'm still unable to meet the $10,000 price point. I propose we aim for $9,000 for the product, without any additional services or warranties. I believe this would be a fair compromise and allow us to conclude our negotiations.",9000.0,Bob,10,
