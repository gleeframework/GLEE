{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for your company. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000. This price reflects the substantial value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob's company to justify the price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer provides space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like it's a huge jump.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's perceived value as possible, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than John's offer. 
* I'll carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers and adjust mine accordingly to maximize my earnings. 
* I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's offers are too low, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my company's interest in your product. While I understand its value, we're looking to keep our expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me and doesn't leave me with a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe I can push for a higher price. Bob's counteroffer shows his interest and willingness to negotiate, which gives me leverage. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my profit margin. 
* I'll continue to assess Bob's counteroffers and adjust my own to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, always keeping John's offer as my fallback."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant benefits you'll realize from using it. I'm confident this price is still a good deal for you, while ensuring a fair return for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step down from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at a steep discount.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits to him to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to maintain a constructive negotiation and keep Bob engaged. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to meet me halfway. If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider his next move and how much further I'm willing to compromise.
* I'm prepared to reject his next offer if it's too low and potentially make another counteroffer, while always keeping John's offer in mind as my safety net."
