Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $82.50, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John."
