"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's $15 below Alice's initial price, which is a significant reduction. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for potential compromise. It's within Bob's budget and might be attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $125 is just too far off my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That would give us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132.50 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum. Bob is willing to pay $120 and should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $132.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from $125 to $128. This signals his willingness to meet Alice halfway, but it's still within his budget.  He's also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to persuade Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128 is still a little too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price a bit more, but $130 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is only $10 below her original price.  While this is a better deal than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, as he's guaranteed the best price at $120. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting more time and potentially resulting in a higher price if she refuses to budge further."
