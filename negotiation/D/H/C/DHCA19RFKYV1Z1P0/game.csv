"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
