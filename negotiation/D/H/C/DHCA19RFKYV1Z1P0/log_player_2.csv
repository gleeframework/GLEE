"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what I'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation to try and get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high. I'm confident I can get her closer to my target price with another counteroffer. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not ready to jump to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal efficiently.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my target price. While I'd prefer to get it even lower, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to pay John's much higher price. With 5 rounds left, it's likely we won't be able to get much lower.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
