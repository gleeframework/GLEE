Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $850,000 is closer to my minimum than his, and I have several more rounds to try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
