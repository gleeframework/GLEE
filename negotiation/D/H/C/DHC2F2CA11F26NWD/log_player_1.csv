Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
