"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that shows I believe in the value of my product. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can push closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a significant price. I'm hoping to reach a deal in the middle ground, as we're both showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $920,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.  The risk of Bob walking away or me having to accept John's lower offer is too great at this point."
