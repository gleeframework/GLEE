"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $12,500.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal with Bob before I have to settle with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's also getting late in the negotiation process. Accepting this offer secures a sale and ensures I don't have to settle for John's lower price."
