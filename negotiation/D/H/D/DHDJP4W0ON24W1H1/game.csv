"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still allows you to make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
