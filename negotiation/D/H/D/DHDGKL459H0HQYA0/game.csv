"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $14000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $14500. This is still a compromise, but it's closer to the value I have in mind. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $13500. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it will be a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $14000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in mind, and it's still a compromise on both our parts. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",14000.0,Alice,7,
