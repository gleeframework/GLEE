"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500?  It's closer to your value and it's within my budget.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
