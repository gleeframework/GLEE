"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's not worth it to accept the offer at this point. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower offer than John's price, but still within my budget.  This sets a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like. It's closer to my budget but I can still try to negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a stretch for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500?  It's closer to your value and it's within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also sticking to my budget. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing enough for Alice to accept."
