"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and leaves room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for potential counteroffers.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's too risky to accept such a low offer, as I stand to lose a significant amount of money. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer. This will give me more control over the negotiation and hopefully bring Bob's offer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum but reflects Bob's lower offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate the situation and consider whether selling to John at $1,500,000 is a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000, especially since I have the option to sell to John for that amount. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still ensuring I make a reasonable profit.  If he rejects this offer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John as the negotiation seems to be stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant. I'm not convinced that I can get a better offer from him with just 4 rounds remaining.  However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, hoping to find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000.  This is just slightly above my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant drop from my previous offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob seem to be stalling.  While his offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to receive.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'll choose to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a better result."
