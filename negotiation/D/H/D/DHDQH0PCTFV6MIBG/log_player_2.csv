"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value for us at $15,000. Considering its worth to you, I propose we strike a fair deal. For this extraordinary opportunity, I am offering the product to you at $13,000. This price not only ensures a beneficial transaction for both parties but also allows you to acquire an asset valued at $15,000 for a reasonable investment. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this valuable exchange. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum valuation.** While it's lower than John's price, you're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice's offer is only $2,000 less.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is clearly motivated to sell, as her offer is below her stated value. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice. She might be willing to lower the price further, getting you closer to your target. If she doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on buying from John at your maximum price."
