"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand it's a significant investment for you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save money, and while $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  You have the option of going with John, so it's worth trying to squeeze a bit more out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $13,000?  That would be a great compromise and I'd be happy to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 13000}
