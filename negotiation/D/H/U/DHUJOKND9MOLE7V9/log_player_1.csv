"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's slightly below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand it's a significant investment for you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $13,000?  That would be a great compromise and I'd be happy to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is closer to my minimum and it's a good compromise.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to go back to John."
