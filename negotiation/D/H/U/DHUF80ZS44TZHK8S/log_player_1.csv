Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob but also nets you a profit above your guaranteed sale. Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a preferential price of $1,350,000 before exploring other options. This is a limited-time offer, as I have considerable interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of value and urgency.
* **Preferential Price:** Implying Bob is getting a special deal encourages him to act quickly.
* **Limited-Time Offer/Other Interest:** Creates a sense of scarcity and competition, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you a $150,000 buffer above John's offer and leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still benefiting from a price below his perceived value. 

**Important Note:**  Bob may counter-offer.  Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. You have a strong fallback option with John."
