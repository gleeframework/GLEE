"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $118. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",118.0,Alice,5,
