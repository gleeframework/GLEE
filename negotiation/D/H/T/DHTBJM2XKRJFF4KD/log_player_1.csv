Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than Bob's value of $150, so he has room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's value, earning more, while still leaving room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your desired profit margin. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
This counteroffer is still above your minimum and leaves room for negotiation, while also demonstrating your willingness to compromise.  It's a good balance between maximizing your profit and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, $105 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $80, and while it's lower than your ideal, it's a reasonable price given Bob's negotiation and the possibility of him walking away entirely.  It's a good outcome to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
