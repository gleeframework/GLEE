"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth that much to you, and it's my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but no more. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,
