"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to invest in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum of $1,200,000, you can do better. John's offer of $1,200,000 acts as a fallback option, meaning you should aim to pay less than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer or further negotiation."
