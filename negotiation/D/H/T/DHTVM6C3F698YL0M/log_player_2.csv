"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a good deal at $900,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is still a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than the product's value to him.  There is a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice rejecting further counteroffers outweighs the potential savings."
