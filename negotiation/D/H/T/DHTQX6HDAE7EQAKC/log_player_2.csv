"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range, or you can proceed with buying from John at your target price."
