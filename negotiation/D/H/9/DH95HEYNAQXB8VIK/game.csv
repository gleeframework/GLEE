"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700,000 to $800,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway.  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's find a way to make this work!",850000.0,Alice,3,
