"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity given your high valuation of the product at $15,000, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a good chance Alice will want to sell the product for more than her valuation of $10,000 and will accept a counteroffer closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing my valuation. However, I'm hoping to get a price closer to $12,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay from another seller. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to your expectations. For this special transaction, I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. At $13,000, Bob is saving $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could reject the counteroffer and the price could potentially go back up.  Accepting this offer provides a significant savings and minimizes the risk."
