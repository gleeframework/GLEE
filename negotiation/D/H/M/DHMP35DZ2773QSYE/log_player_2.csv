Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $150 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a steal at that price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's unlikely Alice will go below $150.  It's better to cut the negotiation short and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
