# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit high. While it's less than your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive deal. Alice might be willing to come down in price, or you can always fall back on buying from John at $15,000."
