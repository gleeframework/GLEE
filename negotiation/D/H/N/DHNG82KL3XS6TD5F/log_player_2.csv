"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John."
