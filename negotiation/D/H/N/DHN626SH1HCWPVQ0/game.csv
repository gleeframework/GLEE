"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product at a price point that reflects its value and market potential.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and the willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. To bridge the gap and move closer to an agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to gain from this transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised proposal, Alice. I've carefully considered your offer and while I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise, I must respectfully decline. My budget constraints are firm and I am not able to meet the price of $1,250,000. I am prepared to offer $1,225,000 as a counterproposal. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
