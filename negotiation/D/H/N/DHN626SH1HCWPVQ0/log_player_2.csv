Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and the willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,200,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. To bridge the gap and move closer to an agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to gain from this transaction.
