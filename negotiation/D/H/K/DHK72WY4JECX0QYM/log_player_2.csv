"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $700,000. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates my intention to negotiate aggressively. It also leaves room for potential compromise and a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, $850,000 is still above my ideal price point. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial $700,000 counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and her last offer, signaling my desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $820,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price point. While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or I might end up needing to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and secures the product for a good price."
