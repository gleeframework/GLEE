"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be interested in that price?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go a bit higher and meet you at $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Alice,5,
