Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers to your business will far exceed that price. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm focusing on the value proposition of the product for Bob, making it clear it's a significant investment. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to establish a starting point for negotiations and get Bob thinking about the potential value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to stay firm on my bottom line. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the unique value this product offers. It's a significant opportunity for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product, emphasizing its potential benefits for Bob's business. I'm also framing my offer as a collaborative solution, emphasizing the mutual benefit.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price. By emphasizing the value and framing the offer as a collaboration, I aim to encourage Bob to reconsider and make a counteroffer closer to my target."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product holds significant value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $750,000? This offer reflects my budget constraints while acknowledging the product's potential.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to continue negotiating to secure a deal that's financially viable for me.

Selling to John for $1,000,000 would guarantee a profit, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. I believe there's still potential to reach an agreement. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob, aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $750,000 is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still facing a significant financial gap.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product from another seller for $800,000.  I'm willing to offer you $775,000 to make this deal worth your while. This is my final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's clear that Bob is trying to leverage the knowledge of other potential sellers to drive down the price. However, I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price, especially since I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. I'll try to emphasize the unique value of my product, which Bob has already acknowledged. I need to find a way to bridge the remaining gap and secure a deal that's beneficial for me."
