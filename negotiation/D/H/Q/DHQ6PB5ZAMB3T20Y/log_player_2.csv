Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking at other options, but my product offers unique features that you won't find elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly and is unlikely to go below $800,000.  You've given a final offer, and she's still holding out. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
