"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a good deal, considering the value the product brings to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can do $11,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $11,125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more. I can do $11,500, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,7,
