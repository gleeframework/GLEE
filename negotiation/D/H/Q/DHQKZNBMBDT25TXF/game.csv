"I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare gem that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll be thrilled to have it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $9,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. It's a one-time offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it seriously.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good price. I can do $8,200, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a discount from the original price. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I want to make sure you're happy. However, I need to make a living, so I'm not willing to go as low as $7,800. I can meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the same price John is offering, and I'm not sure I want to wait any longer for a deal.",8000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $7,900, Alice. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Would you be willing to accept that?",7900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge from $8,000. I've already told you that's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm starting to think you're just trying to lowball me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $8,000, and that's it. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to explore other options.",8000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to budge, Alice, but I'm willing to meet you at the price I've been looking for all along. I'll give you $8,000 for the product. That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,10,
