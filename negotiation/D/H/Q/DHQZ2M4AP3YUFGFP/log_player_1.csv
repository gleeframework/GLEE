Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be very valuable to you, but let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $135 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates you down a bit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price.
* **Encouraging Engagement:** The message aims to open a dialogue and gauge Bob's interest. If he's hesitant, there might be room to negotiate slightly lower while still staying above your $150 minimum."
