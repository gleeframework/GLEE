"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower price to avoid losing the sale."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good price, considering Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving $75,000 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising her price is high."
