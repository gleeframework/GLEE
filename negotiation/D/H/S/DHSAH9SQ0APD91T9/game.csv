"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. This product provides significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $15,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",15200.0,Bob,4,
