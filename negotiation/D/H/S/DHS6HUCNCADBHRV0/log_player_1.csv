Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While you have a guaranteed buyer, Bob doesn't know that. You don't want to reveal this information and weaken your negotiating position.  

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough to keep Bob interested."
