"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see its immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible and $1,150,000 is still significantly more than what the product is worth to Alice.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you open the door to counteroffers and potentially a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's offer is your absolute maximum, so it's best to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1,050,000, which would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1050000 doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While her offer is lower than before, $1,100,000 is still more than what the product is worth to Alice. 
* **Negotiation continues.** By rejecting, you keep the opportunity to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a backup.** You can always buy from John, but it's best to see if you can get a better price from Alice first."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to compromise, $1075000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to go down to $1090000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While she's coming down in price, $1,090,000 is still above your ideal price and a fair price considering what the product is worth to her. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing.**  You have several rounds left, and it's worth trying to get the price even lower.
* **John's offer is your backup.** Remember, you can always go to John, but it's best to try and get a better deal from Alice if possible."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $1,080,000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I believe is fair. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're on the right track.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm only a small step away from a price that works for both of us.  Let's finalize this at $1085000. It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both parties.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.** $1,085,000 is only $5,000 higher than your last counteroffer, and you're running out of rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  If you continue to reject, you risk Alice walking away or deciding to accept John's offer.
* **Time is running out.** With only three rounds left, you have to decide if the potential savings from further negotiation are worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

**Conclusion:**  While you may be able to get the price lower with more negotiation, it's likely not worth the risk with only a few rounds left. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product and saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
