"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1050000, which would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,150,000. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution we both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can push for a higher price, closer to my desired $1,100,000.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a lower price and will continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $1080000 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I believe is fair. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe there's room for improvement.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price within the remaining rounds. It's not worth settling for a lower price at this stage, especially since I still have several rounds left to negotiate."
