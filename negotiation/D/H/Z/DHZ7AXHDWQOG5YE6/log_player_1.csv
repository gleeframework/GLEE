"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and engaging message increases the likelihood of Bob engaging in the negotiation. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's opinion encourages him to respond and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  While I can sell to John for $150, I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to come up with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting a Middle Ground:** I'm emphasizing that $130 is a middle ground that could work for both of us, increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly to maintain a good rapport during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer. Rejecting his counteroffer shows my commitment to a higher price and encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic play:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and might even lead to a faster resolution in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $128?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $3, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""confident you'll be happy"" to keep the conversation friendly and encourage acceptance.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that the price is good for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $126 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  
* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

Given the limited time and the potential for Bob to continue offering lower prices, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
