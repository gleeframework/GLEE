"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you're willing to pay up to $150, you can use the negotiation process to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to counteroffers and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($120 instead of $150) is a good strategy. This signals your willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for a potential compromise.  It's important to note that this is a starting point, and you might need to adjust your counteroffers based on Alice's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While you might be able to negotiate further, accepting the offer at $140 saves you $10 compared to buying from John. Given the limited rounds, it's a good risk/reward calculation to lock in this price."
