You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes no sense to pay more to Alice.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for a lower price."
