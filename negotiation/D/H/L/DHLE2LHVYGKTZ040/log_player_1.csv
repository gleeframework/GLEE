**Reasoning:**

Bob seems stuck at $82 and unwilling to budge.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Selling to John for $80 guarantees a quick sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure $80 than risk getting stuck in endless haggling with Bob."
