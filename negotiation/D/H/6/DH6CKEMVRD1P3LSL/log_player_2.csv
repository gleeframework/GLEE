"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth at least $8000 to me.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $9500.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $9,500, which is a good deal. However, you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's not a huge difference, but rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $500."
