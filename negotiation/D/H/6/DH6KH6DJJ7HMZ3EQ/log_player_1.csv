Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it valuable, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell to John for $120, so that's your fallback.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight ""deal"" while still maximizing your potential profit."
