{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it more palatable. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, you've made a profit. If he rejects it, you can always fall back on selling to John at your minimum price."
