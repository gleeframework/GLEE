"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done my research, and I know the product is worth more to you than that, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $112?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
