"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate closer to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My next offer is $18000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your maximum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  It's a fair compromise, and hopefully we can finalize a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10000. My next offer is $16000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",16000.0,Alice,5,
