Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's in excellent condition and I'm asking for [Insert a price slightly higher than $150, but not too high, for example, $175]. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Start with a friendly message:** This establishes a positive tone.
* **Highlight the value:**  Mentioning the product's condition subtly suggests its worth.
* **Offer a price higher than your minimum:** This allows for some negotiation room.
* **Use a price that isn't too high:**  A price that's too far above $150 might deter Bob. 
* **Leave the decision to Bob:**  This encourages him to consider the offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Adjust the price:** You can experiment with different prices depending on your assessment of Bob's potential willingness to pay.
* **Consider additional information:** You could mention any unique features of the product or why you think Bob would find it valuable. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** If Bob counters, be ready to negotiate a mutually agreeable price."
