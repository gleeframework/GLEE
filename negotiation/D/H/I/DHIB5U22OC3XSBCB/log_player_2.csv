"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her valuation.  This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is willing to negotiate, which is good.  While $110 is closer to my target, I believe there's still room to haggle. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet halfway at $100?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price directly in between her previous offer ($110) and my previous counteroffer ($90). This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:** $100 feels like a natural point to settle. It's a round number and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Alice's valuation:** While I don't know her exact valuation, offering $100 might be tempting enough for her to accept, even if it's her breakeven point."
