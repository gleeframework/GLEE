"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
