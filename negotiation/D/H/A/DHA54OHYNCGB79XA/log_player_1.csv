"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm not pressuring Bob with a ""take it or leave it"" offer, but leaving the door open for negotiation.

**Note:** I'm leaving room for negotiation to potentially reach a price that is higher than Bob's value but still lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, given his interest in the product.  
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I want to explore if I can do better. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show my willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that is midway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that $16,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Open-Ended:**  I'm keeping the negotiation open, not giving Bob an ultimatum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your suggestion. However, I still think we can find a better compromise. How about $15,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Negotiation Needed:** I don't need to continue negotiating because I've already reached my goal.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I might end up selling to John for the same price.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this round."
