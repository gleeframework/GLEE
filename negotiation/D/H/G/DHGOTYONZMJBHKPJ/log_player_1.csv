Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $15,000 price gives room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Justification:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth to justify the higher price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
