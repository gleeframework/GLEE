"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $140 is just too low for me.  How about $155?  That gives us both some wiggle room.",155.0,Alice,3,
