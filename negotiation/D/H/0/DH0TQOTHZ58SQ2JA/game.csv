"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
