Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice is guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so she shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he could potentially pay more than Alice's minimum and still benefit.
* **The Unknown:**  Alice doesn't know how high Bob is willing to go. 

**The Offer Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Why this Strategy?**

* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 is significantly above Alice's minimum, maximizing her potential profit.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than his valuation, making it a tempting offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, there's a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Alice could adjust her price based on her risk tolerance and any additional information she has about Bob's negotiating style."
