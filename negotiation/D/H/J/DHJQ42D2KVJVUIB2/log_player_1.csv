"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is too low for me."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  While $12,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer is still too low for me, and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or running out of time."
