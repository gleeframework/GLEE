"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110.  Let me know if you're interested!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point. Let's meet halfway again.  How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and I can accept it.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $90. How about we settle at $88? It's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,6,
