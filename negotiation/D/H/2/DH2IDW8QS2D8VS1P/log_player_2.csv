Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,320,000. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the value it will bring to your business.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're close enough:**  Alice is clearly very firm on her price. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and the risk of her walking away increases. 
* **Time is a factor:** We only have a few rounds left. Continuing to push Alice could result in us running out of time and being forced to buy from John at full price.
* **A good deal:** $1,320,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price. 

Taking the deal now secures us the product at a very good price."
