"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I believe this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, I could go up to $1,250,000, but going above that would be really stretching my budget.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your transparency, Bob. I'm glad we're having an open and honest discussion. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,320,000.
