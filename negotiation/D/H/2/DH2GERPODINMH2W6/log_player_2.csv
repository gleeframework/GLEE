Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your $8,000 limit. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
