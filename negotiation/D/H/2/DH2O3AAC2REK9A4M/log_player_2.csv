"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and getting the product for $13,500 is a reasonable deal compared to John's $10,000 offer."
