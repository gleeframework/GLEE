"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we understand your position, we must maintain our product pricing based on its value and market positioning. We're unable to accept $8,500 for the product. However, we're willing to negotiate further. How about considering $9,500 as a reasonable midpoint between our initial offer and your counteroffer?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and are committed to finding a solution that works for both parties. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about we agree on $9,250? This price reflects a fair compromise between our original offers.",9250.0,Alice,5,
