"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Bob and Alice, there is no immediate incentive for Bob to accept the offer. There's a chance to negotiate a lower price.  There's also no need to buy from John yet, as Bob has 10 rounds to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, Bob can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob has 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $1,125,000. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a better deal. This is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. The goal is to find a price that both parties are comfortable with before the rounds run out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,175,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers.  Since only 5 rounds remain, it's wiser to accept this offer and secure the product for a reasonable price. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a worse outcome at this point."
