Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. After some thought, I've decided to offer the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll still be willing to accept it.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer of $900,000 is still a significant discount from the product's true value to him, but it's a bit closer to what I was hoping for.

I've decided to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send him a counteroffer that's a bit higher than his offer, but still lower than the product's true value to him.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 920000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
