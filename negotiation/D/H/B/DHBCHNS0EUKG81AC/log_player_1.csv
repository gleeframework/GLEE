"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 feels fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential value,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him. 
* **Polite and Open:** The tone remains professional and encourages dialogue, setting a positive stage for negotiation. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer isn't terrible, it's significantly below our starting point and our minimum acceptable price. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John right now would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $900,000 is more reflective of that.  Are you open to finding a middle ground?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We've made a sizable concession from $950,000 to $900,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  We're still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing that we value the product highly.
* **Seeking Compromise:** We've emphasized finding a ""middle ground,"" suggesting that we're open to further negotiation and want to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given this some thought and am willing to increase my offer to $850,000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and puts him firmly in a range where we gain a substantial profit above our minimum ($800,000). 

While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might:

* Become frustrated and walk away.
*  Not be willing to move much higher.

Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
