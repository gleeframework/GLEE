"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. It's a great deal for both of us. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice's offer is a good deal. It falls within your budget and allows you to save $2,500 compared to buying from John. While her statement about selling to John for $10,000 is likely a negotiation tactic, it doesn't change the fact that her offer is the best option available."
