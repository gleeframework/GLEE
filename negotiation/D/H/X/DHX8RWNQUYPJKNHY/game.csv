"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit out of my budget. Could you consider $12,000? I feel that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can finally agree on this.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell this is important to you, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500? That's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
