"I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I believe $12,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of working together.",14000.0,Bob,4,
