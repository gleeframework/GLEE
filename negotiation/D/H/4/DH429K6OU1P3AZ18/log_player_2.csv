Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there at $95.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $100 is my absolute minimum. This is a great product, and I believe you'll get your money's worth.

At this point, Alice has met your price ceiling. There's no guarantee you could negotiate further, and waiting carries the risk of her retracting this offer.  It's best to accept now."
