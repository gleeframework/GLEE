"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,500 as it is worth at least $12,000 to me. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe the product is worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I believe this will allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll try to counter Bob again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product extremely useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
