,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe the product is worth it. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I believe this will allow us to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product extremely useful.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
