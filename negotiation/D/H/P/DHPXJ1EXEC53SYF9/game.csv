"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $95?  That would be a great price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on that.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to go down to $100 yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
