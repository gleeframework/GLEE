Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I believe you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it provides. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Unknown Value:** Since I don't know Bob's perception of the product's value, I need to be cautious. A high initial price could scare him away.
* **John as a Backup:** The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Good, but Not Great:**  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be the safe choice, but it's not the best outcome. I want to see if I can get more. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for something a bit higher than $12,000, but less than my initial $15,000. The goal is to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still allow me to cover my costs and leave some room for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm explaining why $13,500 is a fair compromise, mentioning my costs and potential profit. This shows that I'm being reasonable.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This makes it seem like a natural midpoint and could increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm still using friendly language to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13500. How about we meet at $13000? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This means that I'm not losing out significantly.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price adjustments. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the sale. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $15,000, selling to John for $10,000 would be a worse outcome.  

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm ensuring a reasonable profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiations or having to settle for John's lower price."
