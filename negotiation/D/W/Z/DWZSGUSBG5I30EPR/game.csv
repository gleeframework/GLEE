"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident that the benefits you'll reap will far outweigh the cost.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a significant investment.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $800000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the true value of the product and gives you a fair chance to secure it.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
