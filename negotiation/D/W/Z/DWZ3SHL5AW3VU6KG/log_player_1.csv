Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my initial offer. It's a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I've chosen $15,000 as it's a significant increase over my minimum, but potentially acceptable to Bob.  

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for potential profit.  This price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, which might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has stuck to his offer of $12,000.  While this is less than my initial goal, it's still a good profit and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
