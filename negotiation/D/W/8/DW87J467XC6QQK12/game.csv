"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair return on my investment.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
