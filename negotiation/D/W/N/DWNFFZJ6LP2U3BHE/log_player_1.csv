Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm aiming for a profit, so I'm pricing the product higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
*  $1,500,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob if the product holds significant value to him, but not so high as to make the offer immediately unattractive. 
*  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer."
