Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet the product's true value to me.  While $850,000 is a significant sum, accepting would mean losing out on $150,000 I could secure with John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob, especially since he's framed this as his ""final offer."""
