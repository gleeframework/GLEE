"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above your absolute maximum.  This shows you're serious about buying the product, but also sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Justifying the price:**  The message explicitly ties the offer to your budget and the perceived value of the product, making it a more persuasive offer than simply stating a number.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is still slightly higher than your ideal price, allowing for further negotiation without immediately hitting your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time. I'm eager to make this deal happen, but unfortunately, I can't go any higher."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing a genuine attempt to meet in the middle.
* **Setting a firm limit:**  Clearly stating that this is the absolute maximum reinforces your stance and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Expressing eagerness:**  The message emphasizes your desire to close the deal, encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm counteroffering at $9,300. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,300 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price of $8,000. You've already reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a significant drop in price. Given the opportunity to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible option. You'll save $1,300 compared to Alice's offer and achieve your budget goal."
