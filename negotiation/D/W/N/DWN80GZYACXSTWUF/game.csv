"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $9,000? That's the most I'm willing to pay.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. It's still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? That's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.  It's the last offer I can make, I'm really not comfortable going lower.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",9750.0,Bob,8,
