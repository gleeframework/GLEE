I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $800,000."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for closer to $850,000, $825,000 is a good deal and still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's also a good compromise considering we're halfway through the rounds."
