Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm at a price point well above your maximum. It's unlikely she'll go down to a price you're willing to pay within the remaining rounds.  At this point, cutting your losses and securing the product from John at $80 is the most logical choice."
