"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I mention that the product is ""worth a lot to you"", reminding Bob of the $150 value he places on it. 
* **Positive tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Time on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to explore other options and reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get by purchasing it.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  By offering a specific price, I'm avoiding further back-and-forth and pushing the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a bit too steep. How about we meet in the middle at $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $112 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, making it a decent deal.
* **Time is ticking:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal. 
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might not come back with a higher price.  There's also the chance that I won't be able to secure a better offer in the remaining rounds, leaving me with John's offer of $100. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While accepting Bob's offer, I can still explore the possibility of increasing the price slightly in future rounds."
