Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $10,000, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your minimum of $15,000, but you still have room to counteroffer if needed. 
* **It's a positive message:** It frames the offer as a good deal for Bob.

**Remember:** This is just the first step. Be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects, and keep in mind the option of selling to John at any point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $15,000 and even below your initial offer of $12,000.  

Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. You still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but not at a ridiculously low price.
* **Counteroffer is lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates you're flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Positive message:** It's friendly and invites Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next steps:** 

* Wait for Bob's response.
* If he rejects, consider offering a slightly lower price or prepare to sell to John if the price is unacceptable."
