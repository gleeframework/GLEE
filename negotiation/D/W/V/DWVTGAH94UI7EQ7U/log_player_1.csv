"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering the product's value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's considerably lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 and my desired outcome. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a considerable return on investment.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  This counteroffer signals flexibility on my part while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to you, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair and allows for a healthy profit for you.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has significantly increased his offer, and $1,050,000 is a strong profit margin. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk pushing him away and potentially settling for John's offer later."
