"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique piece, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest and the fact that you recognize the unique value of this product. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17000? This would still give you a great deal on a truly special item.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $15000? That would be a great compromise for me, and I think it's still a fair price for this unique product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
