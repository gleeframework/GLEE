This offer starts at a relatively high price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high, but also be prepared to adjust the price if Bob is interested but not willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000 for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique piece, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest and the fact that you recognize the unique value of this product. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $17,000? This would still give you a great deal on a truly special item."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $15000? That would be a great compromise for me, and I think it's still a fair price for this unique product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets my minimum requirement. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept."
