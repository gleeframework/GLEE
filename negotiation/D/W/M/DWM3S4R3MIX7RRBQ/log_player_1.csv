Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **Fair but profitable:** $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal.
* **Open to discussion:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to negotiate.  This makes him more likely to counter, giving me the opportunity to adjust the price.
* **Sets a clear price:** A specific price avoids confusion and establishes a starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80 and is a good deal for me.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure the sale at a reasonable profit rather than risk a longer negotiation that could result in a lower price or even a sale to John for $80."
