"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. My asking price is $1200000, which reflects its exceptional value and potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is your maximum budget. There's no immediate incentive to accept. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value I know it holds, and I'm confident it will be a smart investment for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's a good sign that she's open to negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal by making another counteroffer. You're still saving some money compared to buying from John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
