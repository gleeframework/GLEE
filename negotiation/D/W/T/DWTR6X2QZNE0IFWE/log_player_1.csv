"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will find this a reasonable offer given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $85 just yet.  I'll counter his offer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for a successful negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to settle for $87. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $89. This is a slight increase from his last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise, given that we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find this offer agreeable and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $88 is very close to my minimum, and with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows me to avoid the potential of having to sell to John for a lower price."
