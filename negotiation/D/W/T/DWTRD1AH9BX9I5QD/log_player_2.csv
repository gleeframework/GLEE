# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is less than $150. 
* **You're getting a good deal:**  While you're willing to pay up to $150, you can get the product for $120, which is a savings of $30."
