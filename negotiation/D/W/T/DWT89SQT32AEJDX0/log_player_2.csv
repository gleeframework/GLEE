"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. It has a potential worth of $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up for $800000, so I'm confident in this offer.
