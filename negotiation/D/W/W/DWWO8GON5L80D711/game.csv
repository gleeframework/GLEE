"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking around $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my limit. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
