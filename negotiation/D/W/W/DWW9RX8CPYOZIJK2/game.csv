"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $8,000 range. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $13,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000, but I'd rather make this work with you. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand you have another offer, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,000?  That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
