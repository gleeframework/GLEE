Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

  Bob's offer is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still slightly outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is the closest to my desired price and accepting it guarantees a sale.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I'm worried that if I reject, Bob might walk away.  I want to close this deal and move on."
