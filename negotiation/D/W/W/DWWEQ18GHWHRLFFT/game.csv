"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still slightly outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider my other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
