{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a healthy profit ($200,000) while leaving room for negotiation. It also provides a clear starting point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This price still provides you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price is a great compromise and allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my desired price and is a good deal. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a sale without risking losing out to John."
