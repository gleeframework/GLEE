"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This price still provides you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price is a great compromise and allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's finalize this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
