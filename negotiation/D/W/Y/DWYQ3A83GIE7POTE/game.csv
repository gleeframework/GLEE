"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe reflects the value you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. Let's do $14,000.  This is my final offer, as it's already a significant discount.",14000.0,Alice,5,
