"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to acquire it. I'd appreciate it if you could consider my counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential and the returns you stand to gain.  I'm willing to come down slightly to  $1,600,000. This price reflects its true value and allows both of us to benefit.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,400,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account the potential risks and uncertainties involved. I'm open to further discussion, but I'd like to see if we can meet at a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is closer, but still below what I consider a fair deal.  Let's settle this right now - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,500,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that the product might not be worth this much after all. I'd like to see if we can meet at this price, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
