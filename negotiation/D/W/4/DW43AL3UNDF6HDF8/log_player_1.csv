"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more than $15,000 to me, and I can sell it to John for that price at any moment. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it, you'd still be getting the product for a price lower than its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering it to me right now for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $7,000 is closer to what I want, it's still far below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and the fact that John is offering $8,000. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
