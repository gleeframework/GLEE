"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but  $107.50 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle again. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 still doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  I could come down slightly to $108, but that's my final offer.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $102.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $105. This is my absolute final offer, take it or leave it.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm afraid $105 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $102.50. Can you meet me at that price?",102.5,Bob,8,
