"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend."
