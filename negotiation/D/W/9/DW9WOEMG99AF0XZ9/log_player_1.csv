"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $12,000, which serves as my safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, we'll see how the negotiations go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the bare minimum I'm willing to accept, but I still think I can get more. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered $12,500, which is more than John's offer. I'm willing to accept this offer. The negotiations are taking longer than expected, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's better to secure a profit than risk getting nothing at all."
