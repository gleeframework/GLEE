Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows a willingness to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low, and I'm not willing to drop that much further.  Since John is a guaranteed sale for $15,000, I'll take that option and end negotiations with Bob."
