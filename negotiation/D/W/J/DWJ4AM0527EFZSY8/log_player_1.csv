Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $50,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a strong opening:** Starting high sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the product's value to him. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves you with a considerable gain.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between our previous offers, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $900,000 is still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential gain he'll receive, making it a more appealing offer.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good deal. While it's lower than my initial goal, it's still significantly more than my minimum of $800,000 and only $75,000 less than my last offer.  

Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid potentially going back and forth with Bob further. The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $800,000 offer from John. It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk getting nothing."
