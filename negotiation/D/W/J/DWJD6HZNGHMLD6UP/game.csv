"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1550000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
