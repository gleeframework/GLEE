"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for each of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
