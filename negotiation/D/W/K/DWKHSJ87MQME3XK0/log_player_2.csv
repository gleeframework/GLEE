"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than your perceived value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a better price. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also well above your perceived value of $8,000, giving you some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $10,500, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However,  $10,500 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to meet her halfway. However, it's still significantly lower than her offer, and only $750 above your target price.  This gives Alice some room to potentially accept while still leaving you a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for each of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,500 to $10,000, but that's still too high for me. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried the price might not go down enough to make it worthwhile.  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is my target price.  It's better to just buy from John and save myself the hassle of further negotiation."
