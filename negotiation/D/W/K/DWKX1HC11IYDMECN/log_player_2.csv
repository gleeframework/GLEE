"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. 
* **Accepting saves you money.**  Buying from Alice saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
