"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual market value. Would you consider a lower price?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I also can't sell it for $6,000, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly by offering it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, not from the original price. Let's try $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to go below $8,500, and has stated this is her final offer.  While closer to my desired price, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $8,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice at this point.  Buying from John guarantees the best price."
