"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is unfortunately below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $900000, which is a fair price for both of us. This allows you to still make a profit while giving me a good deal. Let's get this deal done.",900000.0,Bob,4,
