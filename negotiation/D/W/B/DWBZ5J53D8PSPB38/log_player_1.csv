{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, but still a reasonable price given its value to Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation, but also sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to sell it for significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product,  given its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $90, I'm not willing to go below $100, as that's the value of the product to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees I make my desired profit, and any further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
