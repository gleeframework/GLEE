"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll counter with a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I believe this product has value, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects both the product's worth and my financial considerations.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $990,000. This is the final offer I can make. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my absolute maximum is $900,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to respectfully decline and explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
