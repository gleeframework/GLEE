{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **""Great deal""**:  This statement emphasizes the perceived value for Bob, creating a sense of urgency.
* **""Let me know if you're interested""**: This gives Bob the opportunity to respond without feeling pressured.

By offering $10,000, I'm trying to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response. If he continues to refuse, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This is a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **""I understand you're looking for a good deal""**: This shows that I'm taking Bob's perspective into account.
* **""I'm willing to work with you""**: This conveys a sense of flexibility and goodwill.
* **""This is still a great price""**: This reminds Bob of the value he'll get from the product.

By offering $9,500, I'm hoping to reach a compromise while still getting a decent price for my product. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could you possibly lower the price further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to budge on his $8,000 offer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a price closer to my desired minimum of $12,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000."
