"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a 20% discount, which is a reasonable starting point. If she rejects, I'll adjust my offers in the following rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I still want to see if I can get a lower price. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $105. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but also still want a good deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within my acceptable range. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she might increase the price again, or the negotiations could drag on, and I might run out of rounds. It's better to secure this deal at $115, saving $5 compared to buying from John."
