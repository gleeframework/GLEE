"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, as I want to leave room for negotiation and still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up just yet.  There's still potential to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $145? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, $130 is closer to my minimum. I'm running the risk of John changing his mind, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both."
