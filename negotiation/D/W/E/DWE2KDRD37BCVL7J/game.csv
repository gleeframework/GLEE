"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
