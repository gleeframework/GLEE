Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,475,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this transaction and move forward.

Alice is still too far away from my target price and we only have a few rounds left.  It's not worth risking that she'll reject my next counteroffer. I'm going to go with John's offer."
