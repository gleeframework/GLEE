"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7000? It's the highest I can go, but I really think this product could be a great fit for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $7000. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $7750. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $7750. Would you be willing to consider $7375? It's the best I can do, but I really think this product could be a great fit for me.",7375.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $7500?  That's closer to what I need and it still gives you a great deal on this valuable product.  Let's make this happen!",7500.0,Alice,7,
