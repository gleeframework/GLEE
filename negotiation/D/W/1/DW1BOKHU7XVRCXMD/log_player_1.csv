"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate while still securing a price above my minimum. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have 8 rounds to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get closer to my desired price.  I believe this price is more appealing to Bob while remaining within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good compromise considering we still have 6 rounds left in the negotiation. This deal secures me a profit, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob."
