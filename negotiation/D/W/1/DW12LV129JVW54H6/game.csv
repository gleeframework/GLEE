"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my maximum offer. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1400000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident we can come to a deal at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. If this works for you, let's close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to another seller.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering $1350000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident we can come to a deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
