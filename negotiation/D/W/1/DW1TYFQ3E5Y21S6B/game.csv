"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also staying within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
