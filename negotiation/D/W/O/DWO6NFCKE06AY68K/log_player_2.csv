"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the revised offer. I'm getting closer, but  $1,000,000 is still too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000.  Since your maximum is $1,200,000 and John will sell it at that price, it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and go with John."
