"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to take $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you and gives me some room to work with.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $8,750?  That's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is still a bit high for me, but I'm feeling optimistic. How about $8,900? This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's make this happen!",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting really close!  $9,100 is a good offer, but I'm still just a little too high. How about $9,000? This is a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go down to $9,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,9,
