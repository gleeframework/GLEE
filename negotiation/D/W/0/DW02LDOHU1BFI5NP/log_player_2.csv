(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay no more than $12,000, and her offer is $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, so you can try to get a better price.

**Next steps:** You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to take $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you and gives me some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to save money.
* **Staying within budget:** My offer of $8,500 is still within my maximum budget of $12,000.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to push for a lower price:**  I'm offering $8,750, which is still a good deal for Alice and is closer to my desired price.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $9,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging.** She's holding firm at $9,250, which is still significantly higher than my desired price.
* **Time is running out.** We are down to the last round, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** While not ideal, buying from John at $12,000 ensures I get the product within my budget. 

I'd rather pay a bit more than risk getting nothing or spending more time trying to negotiate with Alice. It's better to secure the product now."
