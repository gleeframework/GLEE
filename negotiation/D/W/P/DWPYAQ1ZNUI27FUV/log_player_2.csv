"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** The price is now $13,000, which is only $1,000 more than Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Risk of losing a good deal:** If Bob rejects again, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. He could end up paying the full $15,000 to John.
* **Value proposition:** The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so even at $13,000, Bob is still getting a good deal.  

**Conclusion:** It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that is both reasonable and saves him money compared to John's price."
