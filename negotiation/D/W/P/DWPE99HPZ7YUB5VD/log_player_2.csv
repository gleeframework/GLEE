"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to maneuver and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  While bargaining hard, it's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $60 leaves a significant gap to close, allowing for back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you do $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up:** It's important to show some movement towards Alice's price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counter:** Offering $110 is a significant jump from $60 but still well below Alice's current offer.  It aims to test her flexibility and potentially bring the price closer to your target range.
* **Sense of Fairness:**  Suggesting a ""halfway"" point can appeal to a sense of fairness, even if it's not mathematically precise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $135 is still significantly above your $80 maximum. 
* **More Rounds:** You have five more rounds of negotiation, leaving room to try and get the price down further.
* **Backup Option:**  Don't forget you have John as a backup, ensuring you won't be forced to pay more than you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's getting closer!  I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $100? That's a really solid offer for this product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Movement:** It's important to keep the negotiation moving, and offering $100 shows willingness to compromise further.
* **Below Split:** While Alice proposed $135 as the middle ground, going slightly below suggests you're serious about getting closer to your budget.
* **Positive Framing:**  Describing $100 as a ""really solid offer"" subtly anchors the value in Alice's mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I can tell we both see value in this product. Let's settle this right now - $125 and it's yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Alice is starting to use time pressure (""settle this right now""), but you still have a few rounds left. Don't let this tactic rush you into a decision.
* **Potential for More:** While $125 is closer, it's still above your target. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower if you hold firm.
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $80. This gives you bargaining power."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're almost there!  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $110, but that's really the absolute best I can do."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This sends a clear signal that you're nearing your limit.  Using phrases like ""absolute best"" and ""stretching my budget"" reinforces this.
* **Small Concession:** By increasing your offer slightly to $110, you show a willingness to compromise, but not at the expense of your budget.
* **Time Remaining:** With only two rounds left, putting your best offer forward gives Alice a chance to accept before you're forced to go with John."
