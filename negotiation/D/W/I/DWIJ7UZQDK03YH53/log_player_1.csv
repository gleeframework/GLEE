"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product without explicitly stating my minimum. 

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away and take John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows for a good profit for you, and is closer to the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:** I'm setting a firm price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for some negotiation.
* **Highlighting Potential Profit:** I'm reminding Bob that even at this price, he stands to make a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

My goal is to bridge the gap between our desired prices while staying above my minimum acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Room Remains:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the confidence to hold firm on my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and continue the negotiation process, aiming to reach a price that better reflects the product's worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,037,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your need for a good deal while also respecting the value of my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, highlighting that it benefits both of us. 
* **Urgency Implied:** I'm not explicitly mentioning the remaining rounds, but the phrase ""What do you say?"" implies a sense of urgency to reach an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but $1,037,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,018,750. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,018,750, while getting closer, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time to Push:** With only 4 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  I need to continue pushing for a higher price to maximize my profit.
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:** Knowing I have a safe fallback option with John gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. 

I'll counter with a price that reflects the value of the product and the limited time remaining."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,018,750 is still not workable for me.  Considering the value of this product and our limited time, I'm willing to go down to $1,028,125. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the benefits for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1028125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as a final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Compromise but Firm:** I'm compromising by coming down slightly, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Value & Time Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and the limited time remaining to emphasize the need for a decision.

I'm aiming to secure a deal that is just above my minimum acceptable offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,028,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:

There is no longer enough time to negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I am confident that John will provide a more profitable deal."
