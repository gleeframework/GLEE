"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows for a good profit for you, and is closer to the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we compromise at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,037,500.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your need for a good deal while also respecting the value of my product. What do you say?",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but $1,037,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,018,750. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?",1018750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,018,750 is still not workable for me.  Considering the value of this product and our limited time, I'm willing to go down to $1,028,125. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the benefits for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1028125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,028,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,005,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price?",1005000.0,Bob,8,
