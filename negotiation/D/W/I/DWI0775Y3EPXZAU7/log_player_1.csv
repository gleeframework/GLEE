Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $95 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $100, so he has some incentive to accept. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately going too low. 

Remember, your goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum value ($100) as possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than your initial offer. You have room to negotiate, so rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Is a reasonable midpoint:**  $90 is a fair compromise between your previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Demonstrates flexibility:** By showing a willingness to negotiate, you increase the likelihood of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I think that's a fair price considering the product is worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we want to get as close to $100 as possible, this offer is close enough to the $90 midpoint that we were aiming for. We also need to be mindful of the fact that Bob is willing to pay more than John, who is waiting in the wings for a lower price."
