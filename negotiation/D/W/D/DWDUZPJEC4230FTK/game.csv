"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $875,000. How about we try $912,500?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for finding a middle ground.  While $912,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to $890,000?",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still pushing for a lower price. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about we meet at $915,000?",915000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price.  How about $900,000? This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm not ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to make one last push to meet in the middle. How about $920,000?",920000.0,Alice,9,
