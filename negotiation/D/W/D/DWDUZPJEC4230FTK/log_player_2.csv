Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000 and is stubbornly sticking close to her last offer.  While buying from John is a less ideal price ($1,200,000), it's better to secure the product now than risk Alice not budging and ending up without the product at all after the next round."
