"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1100000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and I'm willing to offer $1000000.  I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000 just yet. I'll counteroffer at $1150000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I understand your value for the product, but I'm  firmly committed to a price of $1050000. This offer is fair, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  Let's close this deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation. ",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'll meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1050000, which is $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to accept it as the price for the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your sticking to your final offer, but $1100000 is simply out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is my final offer, and it reflects a fair price for the product considering its value and our ongoing negotiations. I'm confident we can finalize this deal without further delays.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'll make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $1125000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to budge from this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1125000.0,Alice,9,
