"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but that's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go to $9500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500, which is $10250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
