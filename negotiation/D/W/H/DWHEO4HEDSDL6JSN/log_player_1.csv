Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your guaranteed sale. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer and that other buyers are interested, you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept your initial offer. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the language implies the product's high value, making the offered price seem more reasonable.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down towards his perceived value, knowing you have a bottom line with John."
