"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500.  Would you be open to that?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Alice,5,
