"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique aspects of your product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 would be my lowest price.  I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price in the long run.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? I'm sure we can both walk away happy with that deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
