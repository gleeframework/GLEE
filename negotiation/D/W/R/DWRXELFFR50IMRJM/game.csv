"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $650000. Can you consider this revised price?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700000. I'll make a new offer: $725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit. If not, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1000000.",725000.0,Alice,7,
