"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, which I appreciate. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
