Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, which I appreciate. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
