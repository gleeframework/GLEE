Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you can sell the product to John for $800,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, which is the same as your alternative buyer. This means there's potential for negotiation, but you need to be strategic.

**Offer Strategy**

1. **Start High:**  Don't be afraid to start with an offer higher than $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and might reveal if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
2. **Justification:**  Always provide a reason for your asking price.  Highlight unique aspects of the product or its value.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The offer starts significantly higher than your minimum but not exorbitantly high. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique features"" and ""market value"" to justify the higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Be ready to adjust your price if Bob counters. Have a clear idea of your walk-away point (probably close to $800,000).
* **Listen to Bob:** Pay attention to Bob's response. It will give you clues about his willingness to pay and help you adjust your approach."
