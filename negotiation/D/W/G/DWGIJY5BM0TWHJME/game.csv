"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can get this deal done.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? This is a really good price for you considering what the product is worth, and it's closer to what I need. Let's close this deal!",107.5,Alice,5,
