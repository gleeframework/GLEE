Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and rarity.,175.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145.

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $152. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $157.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",157.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $150. I've already told you that's my absolute max, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. Please let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",150.0,Bob,8,
