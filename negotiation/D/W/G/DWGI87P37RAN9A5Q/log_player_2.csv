# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a good price for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her own valuation, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John for $1,200,000 saves you $200,000, making it the best option."
