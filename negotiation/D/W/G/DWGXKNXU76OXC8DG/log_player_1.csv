Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he immediately accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can start negotiating downwards, knowing your fallback is $15,000 from John.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is phrased in a way that is positive and respectful, encouraging a good start to the negotiation."
