Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob can still get a good deal at $14,000.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're serious about selling to Bob but are also willing to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and how much you're willing to negotiate."
