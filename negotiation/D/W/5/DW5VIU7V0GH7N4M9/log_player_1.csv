Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that splits the potential profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 reflects its worth fairly. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's professional, acknowledges the product's value to Bob, and positions your price as fair.
* **The Price:**  $1,100,000 splits the $200,000 potential profit, giving both you and Bob a $100,000 gain compared to your respective alternatives.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate slightly, but remember your minimum price.
* **Relationship Matters:**  Consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable. If so, a slightly lower price now might be beneficial in the future."
