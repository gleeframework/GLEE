You have three options:

It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice. You can always buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $800,000.  It's a better deal than buying from John and it's likely Alice won't go lower."
