"I'm really interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $1015000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
