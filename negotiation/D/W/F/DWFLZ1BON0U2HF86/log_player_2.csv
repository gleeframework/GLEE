"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. This allows us some room for negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's a good starting point to reject and counteroffer to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong counteroffer:**  This price is within my budget and still reflects the product's value to Alice. It shows I'm serious about buying but not willing to overpay. 
* **Highlight the product's value:**  Mentioning that the price is ""fair considering its value to you"" subtly reminds Alice that she has something to gain by selling. 
* **Establish a starting point:**  This offer sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you presenting your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,100,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. However, it's a more reasonable counteroffer than her initial price.  I'll continue to negotiate to see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To meet halfway, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Acknowledging value:** I reiterate the product's value to maintain a positive tone and emphasize the fairness of the offer.
* **Stating confidence:**  ""I'm confident we can reach an agreement""  suggests I'm serious about buying and encourages Alice to accept."
