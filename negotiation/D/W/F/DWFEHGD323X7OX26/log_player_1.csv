Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can you consider this price?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to your minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or you having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000."
