It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Even if Alice won't budge, you'll learn more about her willingness to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering $120. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$135 is a good price, and I don't want to risk going back and forth with Alice for too long.  There's a chance she'll hold firm at $135, and then I'd be stuck paying $150 to John."
