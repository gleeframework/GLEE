"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly hovering above $1,000,000. It's unlikely she'll go below that threshold in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving us time and potential further negotiation with Alice."
