Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It allows for negotiation while still leaving a significant profit for me. I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's value of $15,000, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I also believe the product is worth more than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still slightly below my desired price, but it's clear we're not going to get any higher.  Given that I can always sell to John for $10,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action."
