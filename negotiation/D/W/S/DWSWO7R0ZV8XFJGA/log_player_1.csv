Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,490,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,490,000 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning other interested parties, we subtly remind Bob he's not the only potential buyer, increasing the offer's attractiveness. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price exceeding our guaranteed sale, while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
