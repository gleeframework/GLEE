"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still a little higher than my minimum. I'm hoping that we can reach an agreement quickly and avoid having to go through multiple rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $132.50 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my desired price that I'm happy to accept it.  It's more than what John is offering, and I'm confident that I can still make a good profit on this deal."
