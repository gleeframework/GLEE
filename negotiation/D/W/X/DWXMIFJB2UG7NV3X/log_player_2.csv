"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds and the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm willing to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet because I have more rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go down to $650,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and counteroffer at $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While $675,000 is still more than my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay.  Considering I have limited rounds and I'm not sure if Alice will budge further, it's a good deal at this point. It's also a better price than buying from John."
