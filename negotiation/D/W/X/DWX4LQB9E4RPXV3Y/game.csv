"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our values, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value the product at more than $8,000, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,000? This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
