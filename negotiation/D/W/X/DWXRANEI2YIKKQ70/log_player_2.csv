Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is firm at $875,000 and has even threatened to walk away.  Knowing John will sell the product for $800,000 makes accepting Alice's offer a waste of $75,000."
