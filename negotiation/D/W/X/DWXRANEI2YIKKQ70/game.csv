"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. I think this price is more in line with the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget on this purchase.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $775,000?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",875000.0,Alice,7,
