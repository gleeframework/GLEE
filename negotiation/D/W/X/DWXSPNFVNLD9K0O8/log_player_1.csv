Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value to create a positive impression.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to secure the best possible price. However, I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, always keeping in mind the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($15,000), as I have a backup buyer (John) for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to negotiate a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to discuss a price around $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and I have a backup buyer (John) who is also willing to pay that amount. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this scenario. 

**Reasoning:**

* **No further negotiation:** There's no room for me to earn more than Bob's offer. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, there's a chance he might reject my counteroffer, forcing me to accept John's offer, which would result in the same price.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation."
