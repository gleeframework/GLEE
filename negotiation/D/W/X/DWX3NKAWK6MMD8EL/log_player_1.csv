Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not losing anything. 
* However, if Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, I could potentially make a much larger profit. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
