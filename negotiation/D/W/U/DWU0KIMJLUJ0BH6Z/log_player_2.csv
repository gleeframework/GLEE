Alice's offer:

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much money. How about we try $13,000?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging below $13,000. She's gone up in price from her previous offer, indicating she's reached her limit and is trying to hold firm. It's unlikely further negotiation will get you significantly closer to your $10,000 goal. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, guaranteeing the best possible price and avoiding further back-and-forth."
