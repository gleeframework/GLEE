"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.**  You can counteroffer with a lower price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy the product from John for your maximum price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget:**  $850,000 is within your maximum price range of $800,000.
* **Reasonable starting point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is polite and encourages further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, $950,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially reach a price that works for both of you. 
* **Buying from John remains a viable option:**  If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you can still buy the product from John at your preferred price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial amount for me. Let's see if we can find a common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to your limit:**  $900,000 is the highest you're willing to go while still being within your budget.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer is still lower than Alice's offer, but it demonstrates your willingness to compromise.
* **Positive message:** The message is respectful and suggests a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
