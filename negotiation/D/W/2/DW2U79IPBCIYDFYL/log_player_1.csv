Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Negotiable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed while staying well above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language suggests you're confident in the product's worth, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go based on his response and your assessment of the situation."
