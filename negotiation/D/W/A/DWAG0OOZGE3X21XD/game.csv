"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm offering it at $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see the value in your product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of the product.  I understand your position on $18,000. Could we potentially meet in the middle at $15,000? This would still represent a significant discount for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $13,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
