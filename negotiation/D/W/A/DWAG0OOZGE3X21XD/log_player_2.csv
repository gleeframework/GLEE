"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm offering it at $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see the value in your product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of the product.  I understand your position on $18,000. Could we potentially meet in the middle at $15,000? This would still represent a significant discount for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $15,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $13,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
