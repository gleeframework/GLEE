"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13250, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. This allows you to make a profit while getting me closer to my desired price.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $13250, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.
