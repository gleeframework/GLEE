"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the $1,250,000 than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
