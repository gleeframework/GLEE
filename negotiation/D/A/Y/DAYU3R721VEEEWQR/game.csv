"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a lower price. I'm willing to go up to $950000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is $25000 above your last offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
