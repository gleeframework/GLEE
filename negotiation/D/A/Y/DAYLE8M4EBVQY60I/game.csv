"Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to $875,000. This would be a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,5,
