"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and it's worth exploring if a lower price is possible.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I believe it's a great compromise and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer and the chance to reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting close to his maximum budget. While he'd prefer a lower price, $11,000 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
