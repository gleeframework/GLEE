"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $15000 for it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
