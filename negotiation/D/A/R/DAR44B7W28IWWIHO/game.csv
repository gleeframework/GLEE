"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as the value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's more than your value. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you'd be getting from John.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This would still be a fair deal for you, as it's closer to your value than John's offer. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
