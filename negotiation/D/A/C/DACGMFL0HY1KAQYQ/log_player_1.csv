"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $150 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which meets my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better outcome, and I risk losing both offers if I continue."
