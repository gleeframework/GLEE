"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,220,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
