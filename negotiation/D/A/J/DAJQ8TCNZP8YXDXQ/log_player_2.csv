# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,220,000.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,220,000 is still more than what he's willing to pay, and he can secure the product from John at his desired price of $1,200,000.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
