"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $85, which is a good price for the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
