"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $975,000. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price is a fair compromise, giving you a decent profit while remaining within my price range. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,6,
