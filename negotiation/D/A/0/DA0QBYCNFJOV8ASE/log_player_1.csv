"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone in my message to make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, hoping to pique his interest.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if needed. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $150, so I'm willing to walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further, as I have the option to sell to John for $150. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue the negotiation and try to meet in the middle.  If Bob becomes stubborn, I'll have the option to sell to John and avoid losing money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's split the difference and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $135, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, highlighting the value of the product and suggesting a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise price that is acceptable to both of us, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $132.50? Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still hoping to get closer to $135. I want to see if he is truly willing to budge further. Additionally, selling to John for $150 is still a very attractive option, giving me the leverage to continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue the negotiation process and try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I am not willing to settle for an offer that is significantly lower than my desired price, especially with the option to sell to John still available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $134.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 134} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $134, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both parties and highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, reminding Bob of my willingness to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue slowly decreasing my price to find a compromise.  I am still holding out for a better price than $132.50, but I am also mindful of the option to sell to John.  I'm hoping to make a deal in the next couple of rounds before the time limit is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $134. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $133 is only $1 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  Since selling to John for $150 is still an option, I'm not risking too much by accepting.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to prioritize closing the deal, even if it means accepting a slightly lower price than I initially hoped for. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on the sale completely."
