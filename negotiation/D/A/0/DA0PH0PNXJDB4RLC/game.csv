"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $90. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want to save some money, but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $75.  Let's make this deal happen!",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $75. How about we try $72.50?",72.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $72.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $73.75? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",73.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $73.75 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $72, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",72.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $72 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $73.  Let's split the difference at $72.50. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",72.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $71.50, but that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",71.5,Bob,8,
