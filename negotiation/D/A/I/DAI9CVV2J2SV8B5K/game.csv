"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
