Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to negotiate.
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:**  You're not starting at your absolute highest price, indicating you're willing to compromise to some extent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is still a good price, it's too close to your minimum, and there's still room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle:** This offer is closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates you're willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's profitable for you.
* **Positive messaging:** The message remains friendly and highlights the value Bob will gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,400,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good price. It's above my minimum of $1,200,000, and it's likely that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob, especially since he's indicated this is his final offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000, it's better to secure a sale at a good price than risk losing the deal altogether."
