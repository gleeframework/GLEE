I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price, and Bob doesn't seem willing to go higher.  John is a sure deal at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, so I'm going to take that option."
