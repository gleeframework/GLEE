"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, you can potentially get the product for even less by making a counteroffer. You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $130 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While you could continue to negotiate, $125 is a good deal considering your maximum price is $150.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further haggling and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
