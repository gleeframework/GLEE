"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think the product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $125.  It's getting close to what I'd pay John, and I'm not sure it's worth it.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  If you can't meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which is $117.50. That's my final offer for now.",117.5,Alice,7,
