"Bob, I appreciate you countering and getting back to me so quickly.  While that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I do want to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
