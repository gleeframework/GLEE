Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the warranty and support, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
