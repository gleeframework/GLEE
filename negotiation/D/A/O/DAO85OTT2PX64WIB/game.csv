"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
