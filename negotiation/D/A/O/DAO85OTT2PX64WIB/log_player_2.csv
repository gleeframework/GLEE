"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial $20,000, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price."
