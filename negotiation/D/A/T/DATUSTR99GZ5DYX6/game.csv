"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
