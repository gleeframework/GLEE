"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you've indicated it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Buying from John saves you a considerable amount of money."
