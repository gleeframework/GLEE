"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. Let's compromise. How about $8,200? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,900. Can you consider that?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $7,900 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,050.  This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",8050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $8,050 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,950. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $8,000.",7950.0,Bob,8,
