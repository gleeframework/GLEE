"Bob, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,500,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product has great value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to consider $1,625,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's more than fair.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,575,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product and the concessions you've made so far.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
