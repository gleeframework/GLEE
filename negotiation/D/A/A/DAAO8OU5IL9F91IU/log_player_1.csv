"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we discuss $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,100,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and Bob is clearly willing to move towards our price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're now above our minimum acceptable price. Taking the $1,050,000 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
