"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for $1,500,000, so there's no pressure.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
