"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a reasonable return for me.",90.0,Alice,3,
