"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let's meet at $950,000, and I'll include some premium support and maintenance services.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of support and maintenance, Alice, but those extras aren't as valuable to me.  How about this:  I'll meet you at $937,500, and we can close the deal today. It's a win-win.",937500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $937,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. Let's try $975,000, and I'll throw in an additional feature that will make the product even more valuable to you.",975000.0,Alice,7,
