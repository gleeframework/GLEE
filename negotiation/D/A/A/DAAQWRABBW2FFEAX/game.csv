"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
