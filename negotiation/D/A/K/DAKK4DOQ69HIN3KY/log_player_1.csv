Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, it emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential,"" subtly suggesting a price higher than that. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains polite and open to discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing an extra $500,000 makes this a calculated risk worth taking. You have the safety net of John's offer if needed."
