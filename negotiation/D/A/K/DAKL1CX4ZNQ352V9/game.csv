"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not there yet. $8,750 is a bit too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time* and offer $8,875.  This is my final concession, and I hope you see the value in accepting.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your final concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me halfway again.",8800.0,Bob,6,
