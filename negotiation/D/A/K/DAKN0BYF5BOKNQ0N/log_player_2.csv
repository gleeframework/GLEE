{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price, it's significantly lower than his previous offers and only slightly higher than what he could get from John. He's running out of time and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing.  At this point, it's a good compromise and he's likely to get a better deal than his initial budget allowed."
