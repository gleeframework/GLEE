"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to your business. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. That's the highest I can go, so I hope we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
