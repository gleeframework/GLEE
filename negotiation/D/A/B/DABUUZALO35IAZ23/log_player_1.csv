Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price range."
