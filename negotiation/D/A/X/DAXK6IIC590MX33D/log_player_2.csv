"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's something that's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. How about $100? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so I'm sure she can do better than that. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better price.
