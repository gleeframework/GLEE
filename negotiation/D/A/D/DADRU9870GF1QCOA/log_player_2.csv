"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get the product for less than $950,000, and saving even a small amount is worthwhile."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $800,000.  It's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate. While you could buy from John, there's still a chance you could get a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $85,000 higher than John's offer. It's possible you could negotiate further and get Alice to come down to $850,000 or even lower, but the risk is that she'll walk away, leaving you with no product. 

Considering the small difference in price, it's likely more prudent to accept Alice's offer and secure the product.  You've already gotten a decent discount from her initial price of $1,000,000."
