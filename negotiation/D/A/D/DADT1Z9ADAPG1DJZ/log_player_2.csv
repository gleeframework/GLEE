"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $9,200. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, especially considering her own valuation of the product. There's a good chance to negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,200 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:**  I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation. This strategy often leads to a better final price.
* **Considering Alice's valuation:**  I know Alice values the product at $8,000.  My offer of $6,000 gives her a chance to still make a decent profit. 
* **Time constraint:** While I have 10 rounds, I don't want to drag this out too long. A strong counteroffer might encourage Alice to move closer to my desired price range more quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000, which is still a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, accepting $8,000 would mean I gain no benefit from the negotiation.  There's still room to push for a lower price, especially since I'm willing to walk away and pay John $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. How about $6,750?"",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm raising my offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but want to reach a compromise.
* **Targeting the middle ground:**  My offer is roughly halfway between my previous offer ($6,000) and Alice's current price ($8,000). This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much.
* **Alternative option:** I still have the option to buy from John at $10,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer Alice makes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,500, which is still a good price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $7,500 is a solid price. It's significantly less than John's offer ($10,000) and a reasonable compromise from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited rounds:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. While I could push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice might not budge much further.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. It's unlikely I'll get the price much lower than $7,500, and I risk Alice becoming less willing to compromise."
