"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $12,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
