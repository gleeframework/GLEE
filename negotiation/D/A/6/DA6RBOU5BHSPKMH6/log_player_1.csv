{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

This offer starts at a price that's higher than your minimum value, giving you some room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of something around $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $115 is still lower than your initial offer, it is higher than your minimum acceptable value of $100 and also higher than what John is offering. This is a reasonable price to ensure a sale and maximize your earnings at this stage."
