Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows for some negotiation room while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting that it's a ""special price"" and emphasizing ""value"" aims to make the offer more enticing to Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer tempts Bob with a price lower than your guaranteed sale to John, while still aiming for a profit margin."
