"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's discuss a fair price for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is a decent price, but there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $85 feels a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while leaving room for further negotiation. By expressing continued interest and a willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage Alice to engage without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $70 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $70 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

Alice has signaled some willingness to negotiate by lowering her price. This counter-offer aims to find a compromise by suggesting a price halfway between our previous offers.  The friendly tone and use of ""we"" encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. I propose a price of $68 for the product. This is my best offer, considering its value and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled that this is her best offer. While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the difference at this point is likely to be small. Accepting $68 secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling or Alice becoming less willing to compromise."
