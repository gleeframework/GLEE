"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This still represents a significant saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
