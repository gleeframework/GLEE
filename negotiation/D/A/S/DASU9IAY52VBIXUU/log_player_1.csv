Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! How does $180 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($180) and higher than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or a counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at potential scarcity and value by mentioning listing it publicly. This might make Bob more inclined to accept the offer.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, ensuring I don't make a loss."
