Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested. However, $9000 is a bit higher than my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8200 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. How about $7800? That's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7800 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8000, and I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you accept, we can close the deal right now. ",8000.0,Bob,6,
