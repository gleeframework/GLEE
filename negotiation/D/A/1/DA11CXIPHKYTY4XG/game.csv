"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm pretty serious about getting this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
