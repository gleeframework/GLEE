"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a substantial profit while still getting a fantastic product. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's still within your budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You have a clear advantage knowing that you can purchase the product for $800,000 from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price allows for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high. You have a solid fallback option with John, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is getting closer to what I need.  However, I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This price would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a fantastic deal.  Let's finalize this and close the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than your initial counteroffer of $900,000.  This is a good deal for you, considering you have a backup option of purchasing the product for $800,000 from John.  There's a good chance that if you reject this offer, Alice might not budge further, and you might end up having to buy from John anyway.  Accepting this offer saves you time and potentially further negotiation."
