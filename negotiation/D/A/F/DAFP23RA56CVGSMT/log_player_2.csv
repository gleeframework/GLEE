"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product to you. I'm thinking of a price of $180. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!  You should definitely counteroffer a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to appear serious about buying but also firm about your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still over your budget. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a bit further down before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we try $80? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

You're now offering your maximum price. This puts the ball in Alice's court while signaling that you're serious but have a firm budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $80, but I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'm thinking of a price of $140. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go down to a price you're willing to pay.  You've done well negotiating, but now it's time to cut your losses and get the guaranteed deal from John."
