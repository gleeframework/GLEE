Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850.

```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's slightly above his budget, it's only $850 more than what John is selling it for. He's already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and this is a relatively reasonable price considering Alice is willing to come down to his budget."
