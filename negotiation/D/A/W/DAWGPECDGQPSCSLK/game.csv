"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you, and its value is easily worth $1,500,000. However, as I'm looking for a swift and mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1175000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,220,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly. $1,180,000, my final offer. This is a significant discount and a decision you won't regret.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
