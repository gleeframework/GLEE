"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above your desired price point of $15,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$11,500 is still above Bob's target price of $15,000.  He should continue to negotiate, as there is still room to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
