,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This price reflects the true value of the product while still giving you a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",11000.0,Bob,4,
