"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $9,000.  Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its value. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $9,500 is a significant gap from where we started.  Would you be willing to consider $10,200?  This feels like a fair compromise.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, I am serious about buying this.  Let's make this simple - $9,800 and we have a deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
