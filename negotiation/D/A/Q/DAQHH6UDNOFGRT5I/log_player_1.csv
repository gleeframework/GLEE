Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than your $80 minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob."
