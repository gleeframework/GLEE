"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  $9,000 is a decent compromise, significantly lower than Alice's original offer but still potentially profitable for her.  This counteroffer is also significantly lower than Bob's fallback option of $15,000 from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still far from Bob's ideal price.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to his desired range.  $10,000 is a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired range, it's still too high.  It's only $1,000 less than buying from John, which would be a waste of negotiation time.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but only slightly. He's showing willingness to negotiate while still holding onto his goal of getting a better price than Alice's latest offer.  At $11,000, Bob is still significantly below Alice's offer and closer to his target price. This approach avoids a quick ""buy from John"" decision and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $500 lower than buying from John.  Bob should continue negotiating for a better price. There's still room to get a better deal. It's not worth jumping at a $500 savings when he might be able to get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $12,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, but it is still below Alice's latest offer and closer to the price point where buying from John becomes a viable option. Bob is trying to signal that he's willing to pay more but is also setting a limit.  This could pressure Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is the same as buying from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate.  While it's disappointing not to get a lower price, Bob is still getting the product and avoiding a potential stalemate.  It's best to secure the product now and avoid the risk of further negotiation breakdowns."
