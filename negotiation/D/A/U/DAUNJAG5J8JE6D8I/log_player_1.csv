Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but we need to find common ground.  I'm willing to accept $1,525,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting close to the end of negotiations, which adds pressure on Bob.
* **Firmness:**  The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" language signals that this is the final offer, pushing Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price is lowered, but only slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still valuing the product highly."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,525,000. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While holding out for a higher price is tempting, the potential gains are shrinking. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,475,000 still provides a significant profit margin. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob will walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer of $1,000,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means getting paid sooner, allowing for quicker reinvestment or use of the funds.

It's a tough call, but accepting $1,475,000 balances risk and reward effectively at this stage."
