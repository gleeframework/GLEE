"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  It makes sense to see if he can negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for $12,000. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is getting close to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for $12,000. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
