``` 

While $930,000 is still below your desired price, it's within a reasonable range and Bob seems firm on this offer. It's better to accept and secure the sale than risk further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a rejection. Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if this deal falls through."
