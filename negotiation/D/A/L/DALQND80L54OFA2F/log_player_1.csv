"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" of the product to justify the high asking price, even though it's above Bob's known valuation.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  I haven't mentioned John yet. Having a guaranteed buyer gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to negotiate confidently with Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** His response will reveal how much he truly values the product and how flexible he might be.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, I secure a fantastic deal. 
3. **Set the Stage for Negotiation:** A counteroffer will give me more information and allow me to adjust my approach strategically in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own stated value ($1,000,000). This suggests he's trying to negotiate a heavily discounted deal.  I'm confident I can secure a better outcome by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to move from my initial high price. This demonstrates flexibility while keeping the negotiation moving toward a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and positions us for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've reduced my price by $400,000, which demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum, keeping me in a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value and Fairness:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""fair deal"" and reiterates the product's high value. This reinforces the justification for a price well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure (John in the Wings):** I haven't revealed my alternative buyer yet. This keeps the pressure on Bob, as he's unaware of my guaranteed fallback option.

**Objective:**  This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob to Negotiate Upwards:**  By making a substantial move, I incentivize Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my range. 
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The price remains above my minimum, protecting my interests.
3. **Progress Towards a Favorable Outcome:** The goal is to guide the negotiation towards a price point that is significantly above Bob's initial offer and ideally closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I can go up to $950,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. His statement about $950,000 being his ""limit"" could be a negotiation tactic. I need to signal that I'm serious about my valuation. 

**Next Steps:**  I will make another counteroffer, but this time, I'll introduce the presence of John (my alternative buyer) to apply pressure and demonstrate that I have other options.  This will let Bob know I'm not desperate to close a deal below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer prepared to purchase the product for $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but this is my absolute final offer."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition (John's Offer):** I've brought John into the picture, establishing a credible alternative and signaling that I'm willing to walk away from the deal with Bob if necessary.
* **Firm but Fair Stance:** The message conveys a sense of urgency and firmness by stating ""final offer.""  However, the offer itself is still a significant concession from my previous price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By stating John's offer is $1,500,000 (my minimum), I create a subtle implication that Bob needs to offer more than that to be seriously considered.

**Objectives:**

1. **Apply Pressure:**  The introduction of John aims to motivate Bob to make a more substantial offer to secure the product before he potentially loses the opportunity.
2. **Maintain Control:** By setting a firm ""final offer,"" I control the pace of the negotiation and prevent further lowball offers.
3. **Aim for a Strong Outcome:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offers and closer to my target while being prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I hear that you have another buyer, but $1,700,000 is still  too far from what I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer again, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It seems he's acknowledging the pressure of John's presence but still trying to see if he can get a deal below my minimum.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will convey a sense of urgency and make it clear that time is running out. I will propose a final counteroffer, slightly above my minimum, to incentivize Bob to close the deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I've been very clear about the product's value and my other options.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal today. I'll accept $1,550,000. However, this offer expires now. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:** I'm setting a hard deadline and making it clear this is my absolute final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes that I'm prepared to walk away.
* **Slight Concession, Strong Position:** I've reduced my price slightly above my minimum, demonstrating a willingness to compromise one last time to get the deal done. However, the message is firm - take it or leave it. 
* **No More Room for Negotiation:** I'm avoiding any language that suggests further negotiation. This is it.

**Objectives:**

1. **Force a Decision:** Bob must decide now if the product is worth it to him at this price. 
2. **Maximize Potential Profit (One Last Time):**  I'm giving Bob a final chance to secure a price slightly above my minimum, which would still be a profitable outcome for me.
3. **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I've clearly communicated my alternative and am fully prepared to proceed with selling to John if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
