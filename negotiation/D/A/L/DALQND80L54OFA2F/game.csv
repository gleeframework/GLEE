"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, the product's value significantly exceeds that price point.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,900,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and positions us for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still much higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I can go up to $950,000, but that's my limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer prepared to purchase the product for $1,500,000. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, but this is my absolute final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear that you have another buyer, but $1,700,000 is still  too far from what I'm willing to pay. I can offer you $1,100,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I've been very clear about the product's value and my other options.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal today. I'll accept $1,550,000. However, this offer expires now. If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
