Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate aggressively and hopefully get a price closer to my desired range. I know Alice's minimum is $800,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but still aiming for a good deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about purchasing. I'm increasing it to $775,000, which is closer to her offer, but still within my budget.  This should hopefully be a sweet spot that is attractive to her while remaining a good deal for me."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price of $775,000. We are getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at $787,500. This is a compromise between our previous offers, demonstrating my willingness to reach an agreement.
