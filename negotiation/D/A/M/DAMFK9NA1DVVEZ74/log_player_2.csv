"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $12,000.

Let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $9,500 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $10,500? This still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting the value you place on the product.
