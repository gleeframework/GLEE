""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at $14,500."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a faster sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $14,500 offer is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed.
    * Attractive enough to potentially entice Bob to buy now rather than risk missing out. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase."
