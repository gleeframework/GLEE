Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you can then decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below what I think the product is worth. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, and closer to the value I believe the product holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to what I'm willing to accept, and I'm not sure I'll get a better price in the next round. It's worth taking this offer and moving on."
