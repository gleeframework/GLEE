"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob feel more comfortable and encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Openness:**  Stating I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and signals I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his price. 
* **Rationale:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the product's value.
* **Openness:** I'm still open to further negotiation, keeping the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $130 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $132.50. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid risking losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's lower offer.
* **Potential for Better:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's possible that Bob will not budge further, and I could end up getting less if I keep rejecting his offers.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm ensuring a sale and maximizing my potential earnings in the current situation."
