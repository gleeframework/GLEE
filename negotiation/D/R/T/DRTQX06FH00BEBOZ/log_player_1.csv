{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also leaving room for compromise and indicating I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly above his offer, but still within my acceptable range. I'm also reiterating my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'd rather sell to John for $100 and avoid further negotiation."
