"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially even more so than $1,500,000 given its unique advantages. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique features and benefits that go beyond the standard. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the unique features of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,225,000. I think this is the maximum I can afford without compromising my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
