Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,225,000. I think this is the maximum I can afford without compromising my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

While I could push for more, Bob seems fairly set at a price around $1,225,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $25,000 over John's guaranteed price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
