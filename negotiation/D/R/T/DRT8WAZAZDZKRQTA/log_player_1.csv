Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll get $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**The Offer**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away knowing he can get a better deal elsewhere. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. It's a game-changer in its field.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant ROI you'll experience."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity.
* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $950,000 sets a high point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're connecting it to the ""ROI"" (Return on Investment), subtly implying Bob will make more than the purchase price back.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate but stay firm on your minimum of $1,000,000 (which you're guaranteed from John).
* **Relationship Matters:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable, you might consider a slightly lower price to secure a deal and build goodwill."
