"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, considering its worth to you. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 is still below my ideal price point. I have 8 more rounds and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  It's worth pushing for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds for you.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'm confident that there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob seems eager to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product brings.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a considerable concession from my previous offer. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,062,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is getting dangerously close to my minimum of $800,000, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, with only four rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to secure a significantly higher price. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a much lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
