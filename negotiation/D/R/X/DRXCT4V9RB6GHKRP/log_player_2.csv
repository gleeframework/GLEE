{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this item is closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to $105? I'm very interested in the product and believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $108. It's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the value of the product and your interest in it, I believe $110 is a reasonable price. However, I am willing to negotiate further. Let's settle on $109 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109 is still above your budget, and you've already made multiple counteroffers.  You've reached a point where the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better outcome is high.  It's more efficient to buy the product from John at $100 and save yourself the hassle and time of continuing to negotiate."
