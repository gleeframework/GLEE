"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I understand it's also worth that much to you, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to secure a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
