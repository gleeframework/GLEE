"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I understand it's also worth that much to you, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to secure a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product is worth $1,000,000 to her and that she considers offering you the same price as ""fair."" This suggests there's no room for negotiation downwards from her initial offer.  Since you know John will sell it to you for the same price, there's no disadvantage to declining and seeing if you can get a better deal elsewhere."
