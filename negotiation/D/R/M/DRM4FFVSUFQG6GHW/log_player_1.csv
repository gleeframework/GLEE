"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This establishes a firm anchor and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price gives me space to make concessions in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a final price above my minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000) if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly closer to my asking price, it's still above his perceived value and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm willing to engage in another round to see if I can secure a price closer to $2,000,000. I'm not choosing to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still a good chance of reaching a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you counter-offering and recognizing the inherent value of the product. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, I believe $2,000,000 is a more accurate reflection of its worth given its potential for return. This price is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his price point.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to seriously consider the deal.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the ""potential for return"" to emphasize the value proposition for Bob, even if his perceived current value is lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might walk away, but I'm betting on his initial interest and the significant price drop to entice him towards this favorable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the distance we've come in our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 represents a significant profit above my minimum selling price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
