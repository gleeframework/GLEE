"Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $9,500 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
