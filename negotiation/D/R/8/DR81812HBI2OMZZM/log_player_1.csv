"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a good starting point because it's a bit above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering $110. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he's willing to pay, and it's closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95. This is a good outcome considering the remaining rounds and the risk of selling to John for $80."
