"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if you come down at all.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about a higher price and keeps the negotiation space open for a potentially better deal. You are willing to risk not making a deal with Bob to try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet at $1,450,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firm:**  Acknowledging Bob's offer as ""respectable"" softens the rejection.  Coming down by $150,000 shows movement but maintains a firm stance above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's unique value reinforces the justification for a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Phrasing like ""meet at"" aims for a collaborative tone, suggesting a price point both parties can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to your desired price, but you still have room to negotiate and several rounds left.  While $1,350,000 is tempting, holding firm might yield a better outcome before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,400,000? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your perspective."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $1,400,000, you're meeting Bob exactly halfway between your previous offer and his counteroffer. This classic negotiation tactic can signal fairness and a desire to close the deal. 
* **Positive Language:** Continuing to use positive language like ""appreciate,"" ""compromise,"" and ""acknowledging"" helps maintain a good negotiating relationship with Bob.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message briefly reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from $1,300,000 to $1,375,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The increments of negotiation are getting smaller. It's unlikely Bob will move substantially above this offer.
* **Time Value:** You still have time to negotiate, but the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round.
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,375,000 is a significant profit above your minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a marginally better price."
