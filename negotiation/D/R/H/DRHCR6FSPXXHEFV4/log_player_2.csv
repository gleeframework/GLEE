"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's make this valuable opportunity yours for $95 today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point of $100.  I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your budget constraints. In order to accommodate you, I am willing to offer the product for $92. This still provides a good value for both parties involved. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but $92 is still slightly too high.  I want to try to get even closer to my $90 target.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $92 is closer, but I'm still a little outside my comfort zone.  Would you be willing to come down to $91?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Considering your feedback, I am willing to offer the product for $91.50. This price ensures a reasonable profit for me while still providing a great value for you. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $91.50 is very close to my target price of $90.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer or me missing out on a good deal by going to John increases with each round.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and still saves me money."
