"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9500 is your limit, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This still gives me some room, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $10200, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",10200.0,Bob,4,
