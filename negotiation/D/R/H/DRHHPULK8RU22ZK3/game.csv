"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $110? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",130.0,Alice,5,
