""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Respectful Language:** The message positions the product as valuable while maintaining a professional tone. 

By offering the product at $1,100,000, Alice aims for a significant profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
