"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's ""unique potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing specific details.

This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's position before committing to a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial ask.  Bob's counter-offer indicates he's serious but also leaves room for further negotiation. We're willing to negotiate down, but not to that extent yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,800,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Would you consider $2,100,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:** We're coming down from our initial price to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Smaller Concession:**  The decrease is smaller than Bob's, signaling we're not desperate to make a deal at any cost.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now getting close to our absolute minimum ($1,500,000 from John). However, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. Bob clearly sees the value in the product, so we'll try one more time to nudge him higher before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We are making a more substantial concession this round ($200,000) to signal that we are serious about closing the deal but not desperate.
* **Justification:** By stating this offer is a ""significant compromise,"" we emphasize its value and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price point is closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above our guaranteed sale price to John.

We are getting closer to a point where we need to seriously consider John's offer if Bob continues to push back."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our absolute bottom line. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go any higher. At this point, continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing both Bob and John, leaving us with nothing. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk."
