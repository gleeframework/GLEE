"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something we can work with?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,800,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Would you consider $2,100,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. Can we discuss further?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. Can we discuss further?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
