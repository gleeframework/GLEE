"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was looking for.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000.  This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued negotiations, but $10,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,500. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",9500.0,Bob,6,
