"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth and gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
