"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's better to go with John. There's no room for negotiation with Alice, and buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
