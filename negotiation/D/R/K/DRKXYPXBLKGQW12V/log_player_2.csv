"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and you are looking to spend no more than $800,000, there is significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer of $900,000 allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates my serious intent to buy the product while staying within my budget.  The goal is to start the negotiation process and see how Alice responds.  If she rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point of $800,000. I want to see if I can push for a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter again and potentially secure a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering my maximum price of $800,000. This is a final attempt to secure the product at my desired price point. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy from John as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is only $20,000 lower than John's offer. This is a negligible difference, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing time and potentially ending up with a worse deal. It's more efficient and secure to buy from John at this point, as I'm unlikely to get a better price from Alice, especially with limited rounds remaining."
