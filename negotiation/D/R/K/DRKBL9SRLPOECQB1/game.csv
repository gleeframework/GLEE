"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $18000. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,5,

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the price I was hoping for, Bob. However, $15000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $22500. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",22500.0,Alice,7,
