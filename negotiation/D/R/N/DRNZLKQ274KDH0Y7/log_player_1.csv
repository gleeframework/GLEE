Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference: I'll offer $1,085,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. I'll offer $1,090,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my minimum that it's not worth the risk of him walking away or continuing to negotiate for a smaller amount.  Accepting $1,090,000 ensures a significant profit."
