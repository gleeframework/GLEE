"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $1,050,000.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's on offer.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,120,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference: I'll offer $1,085,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle at $1,100,000. This feels like a fair deal considering the potential it holds for your business.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
