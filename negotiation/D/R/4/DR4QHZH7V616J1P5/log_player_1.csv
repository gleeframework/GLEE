Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Round 3

Round 4

While closer, Bob's offer is still below my desired profit margin. I'll counter in hopes of finding a middle ground closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. Let's try to wrap this up.  Would $1,400,000 work for you? This is my final offer, as I already have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go higher, and while not ideal, $1,300,000 is a decent profit. Accepting now avoids the risk of him dropping out and getting stuck with John's lower offer."
