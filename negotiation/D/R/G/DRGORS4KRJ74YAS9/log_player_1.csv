Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to save some money. I'm willing to pay $8700 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. There's a risk that he might not come up to my price, and I'm not willing to take the chance of selling for less than I want.  Selling to John guarantees my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
