"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial budget. How about we settle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
