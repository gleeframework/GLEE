"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for the value you'll get. ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still really keen on this product, but $110 is still a little outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise and we can both get a good deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
