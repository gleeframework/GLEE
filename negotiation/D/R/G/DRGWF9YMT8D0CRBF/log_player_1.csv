Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High Anchor Point:**  This initial price sets a high anchor, making any subsequent concessions seem more significant to Bob.
* **Ensure Profit Above John's Offer:** The offer guarantees a profit significantly higher than John's $1,000,000 offer.

This strategy aims for a price that is highly profitable while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
