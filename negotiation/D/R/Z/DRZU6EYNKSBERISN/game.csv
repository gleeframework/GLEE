"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $825,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $760,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $40,000. I'm thinking of $785,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",785000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've got to be kidding me. I'll meet you in the middle at $772,500, but that's my final offer.",772500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $772,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $785,000 and $772,500, which is $778,750. Let's call it a day at that price.",778750.0,Alice,7,
