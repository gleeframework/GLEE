Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $120. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down.
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $120, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he doesn't pay $120, it makes prices closer to $80 seem more reasonable. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always decrease your price, but you can't increase it once offered."
