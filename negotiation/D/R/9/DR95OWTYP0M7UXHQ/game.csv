"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more than its reserve price of $1,000,000. To kick things off, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not quite ready to meet your price. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product.  Its unique value justifies a higher investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I've seen in other similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and $1,250,000 is getting closer. However, I need to be sure this deal reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've seen in other similar products.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  While your offer is attractive, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true rarity of this product.
