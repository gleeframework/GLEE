Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This product is truly worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should continue negotiating. While $11,250 is closer to his budget, there's still room for improvement, and he can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
