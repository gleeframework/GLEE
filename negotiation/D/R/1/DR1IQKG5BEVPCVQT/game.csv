"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This product is truly worth it.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
