"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to come down a bit.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
