"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, and her opening offer leaves room for negotiation."
