Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable and aligns with its actual value. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price point.  I want to push for a higher price, and I have rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its potential and would allow us to both benefit from this deal.  I'm confident that this price point is mutually beneficial, and I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the best price for the product. After re-evaluating the market and considering the product's features, I'm willing to pay $1,080,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's actual value and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my bottom line, it's still not at a point I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to push him a little higher with a counteroffer, as I still have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I understand your perspective on the product's value, I believe a price of $1,120,000 reflects a fairer market value and would enable us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This price acknowledges the product's unique features and potential while also allowing for a successful transaction for both of us.  Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1120000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price of $1,120,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering the product's features, I'm willing to pay $1,060,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and would allow us to reach a successful transaction. I'm open to further discussion and finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final few rounds and Bob's offers are getting closer to my bottom line, but it's looking like he might not be willing to meet my target price.  Given that I'm approaching the end of the negotiation and I'm not confident I'll get a better price, I'm going to accept John's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly more than my minimum requirement and guarantees a sale."
