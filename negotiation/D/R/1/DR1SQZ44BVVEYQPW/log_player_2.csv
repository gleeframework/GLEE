"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000.  I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, meaning there's room for a lower price.  It's always worth exploring the negotiation process to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm aiming for right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob.  He's still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John ($1,750), and it's a price Alice is willing to accept.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a better price, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
