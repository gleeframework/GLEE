Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm proposing a final price of $11,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I'm getting close to my budget, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but this time, if Bob doesn't meet my price, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $9,750 is still too low for me. This is my final offer - $10,250.

Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
