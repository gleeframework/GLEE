"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm proposing a final price of $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. I'm getting close to my budget, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $9,750 is still too low for me. This is my final offer - $10,250. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. However, if this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,8,
