This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $75,000 less than John's price and $375,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, creating a sense of urgency. While she *might* negotiate further, there's a risk she won't.
* **Limited Rounds:** You're already halfway through your negotiation rounds. Continuing increases the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to settle for John's price."
