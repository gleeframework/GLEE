"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $11,000. How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm genuinely interested in this product.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,750, but I'm willing to move a bit closer. I'll offer you $10,600. This is my final concession, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,5,
