"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500. How about we try $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $8,250.  That's closer to your offer, but still gives me a bit more than your initial counter. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7,750. Can you meet me at $7,800? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  Let's try $8,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower price. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,7,
