"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $132.50, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $145. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
