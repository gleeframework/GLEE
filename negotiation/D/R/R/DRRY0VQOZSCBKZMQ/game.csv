"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this valuable product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this quality.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand you have a budget in mind. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. $15,000 is my absolute lowest.  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value is important to you. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that price.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",13000.0,Bob,6,
