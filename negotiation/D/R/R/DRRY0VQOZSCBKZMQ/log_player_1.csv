"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I understand you have a budget in mind. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $17,000 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still too far from our minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. $15,000 is my absolute lowest.  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is important to you. While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that price.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{

```

While ideally, we'd get $15,000, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $13,000 is better than risking him walking away and having to restart with another buyer."
