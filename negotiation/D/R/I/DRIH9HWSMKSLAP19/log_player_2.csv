"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its high value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob, even though it means paying a higher price."
