Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can exceed that amount.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $20,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he negotiates down, you're still likely to land above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that you're offering it to him before a public listing implies that he might miss out on a good deal if he hesitates.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this price, but it strategically positions you for the best possible outcome in this negotiation."
