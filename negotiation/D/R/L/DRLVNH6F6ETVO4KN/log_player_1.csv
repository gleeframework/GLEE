"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. I believe the product is worth more than $8,000 to me, so I'm aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my initial ask, and it's definitely better than selling to John for $8,000. It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
