"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would still give you a great deal and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks again for your offer. I truly appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $10000 is getting closer to what I need, I'm still hoping to find a way to bridge the gap a bit.  Would you consider $11000 as a compromise?  I'm willing to discuss this further if you have any thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",9500.0,Bob,6,
