"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less than $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This price still offers you a healthy profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $8,500 is significantly less than $12,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Alice has already moved down from her initial $9,000. Further counteroffers risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Good deal for Bob:**  $8,500 is still a substantial savings compared to Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 

It's generally wise to accept an offer when it's a good deal, even if there might be a slight chance of getting a slightly lower price in the future."
