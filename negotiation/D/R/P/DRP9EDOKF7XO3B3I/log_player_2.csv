# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is way over his budget. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice, or simply buy from John for $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, it's still outside of his preferred range. He can continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to keep costs down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise that still allows for a good profit for both of us. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point, and he has already made several counteroffers.  John's offer of $800,000 is guaranteed and within Bob's budget, so it's the best option."
