"I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to keep costs down, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise that still allows for a good profit for both of us. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
