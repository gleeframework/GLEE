"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. My initial offer is $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high for his budget. He can likely get a better deal with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $880,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $880,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, he can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there. $880,000 is closer, but I'm capped at $860,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your transparency, Bob. I understand the importance of staying within your budget. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's try to find a sweet spot. My counteroffer is $870,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay $860,000,  $870,000 is a good compromise and only slightly above his budget.  He's close to his target price, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice backing out or raising her price again. It's more strategic to secure the deal now."
