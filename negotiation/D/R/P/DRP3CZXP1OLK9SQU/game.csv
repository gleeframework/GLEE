"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle.

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1900000.
