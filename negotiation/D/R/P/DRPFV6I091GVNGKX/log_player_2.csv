Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. Can you meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

While I'd prefer to pay $10,000, Alice seems firm. Accepting at $11,500 gets me the product for significantly less than John's $15,000 price. Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point."
