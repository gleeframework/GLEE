"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Could you do it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Alice,5,
