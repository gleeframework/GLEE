"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a price closer to his desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While he'd ideally pay $10,000,  Alice has come down to $11,000, and this is a good compromise. Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive, making Alice's offer the better choice."
