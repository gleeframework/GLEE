,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low. How about we compromise at $13,000?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $13,000. How about we meet at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle for $12,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
