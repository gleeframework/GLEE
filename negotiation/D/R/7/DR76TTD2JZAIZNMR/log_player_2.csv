"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, you can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and only slightly higher than your counteroffer.  Accepting this offer allows you to save money compared to buying from John."
