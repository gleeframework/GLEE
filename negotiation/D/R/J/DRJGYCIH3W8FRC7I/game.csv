"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $110? This would still be a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $107.50 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $109?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really close to buying from another seller, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm willing to go up to $108. This is my final offer, as it's already stretching my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $108.50, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers.",108.5,Alice,7,
