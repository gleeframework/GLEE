{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my target price of $800,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer and seeing if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I believe there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to move a bit further. However, $1,100,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm offering $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to move closer to my target. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my last offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still too high for me, and she's stated it's her last offer.  While we've made some progress, it seems we're too far apart in our price expectations.  I'm going to buy the product from John at $800,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
