Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** The minimum you'll accept is $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while ensuring you don't go below your reservation price.  There's room to negotiate, but going too low might make Bob suspicious.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  By stating you are ""excited"" to offer the product to *him* specifically, you create a sense of value and relationship.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential value"" subtly implies Bob could gain even more than he currently anticipates.
* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,350,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Time Constraint:**  The 24-hour limit adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start a bit higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, a slightly lower price might be strategic.
