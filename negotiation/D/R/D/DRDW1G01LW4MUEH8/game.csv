"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $135 for it.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $140.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise there. ",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
