"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the product's worth to me, subtly suggesting its actual value is even higher.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages a deal. 

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming to secure a price close to my minimum while allowing for potential counteroffers. I'm also leaving the door open for John's offer if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can offer you a fair price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob, hoping to push the price closer to my desired range. I'm also keeping John's offer as a safety net, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,075,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining why I can't accept his offer, emphasizing my need for a certain price.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a fair compromise, highlighting the potential benefit for both of us.
* **Open-ended question:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially make a counter-offer himself.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to slowly bridge the gap between our desired prices. This counter-offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is above my minimum threshold. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, and I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to suggest a price of $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000.  While I'd ideally like to get more, it's a good deal considering:

* **Time:** We are already in round 4, and time is a factor. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even if this price isn't ideal, it could open the door for future negotiations with Bob, potentially on different products or services.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a solid deal and keeps the possibility of a future business relationship with Bob. It also eliminates the risk of losing out entirely by rejecting the offer and potentially ending negotiations."
