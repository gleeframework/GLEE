"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1100000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a reasonable compromise considering its worth to me is $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. Considering its worth to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $975000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
