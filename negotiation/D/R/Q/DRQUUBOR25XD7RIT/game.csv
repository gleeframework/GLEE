"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $8000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $8500.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $8750 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we compromise at $9000? It's a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8800. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8800 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8900. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. I hope we can reach an agreement in this final round before I need to explore other options.",8900.0,Alice,7,
