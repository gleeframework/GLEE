"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm starting the price at $120, but I'm open to negotiation.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This gives us both a good deal, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $97.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not far off, and I'd like to make a final push. I can do $99, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",99.0,Bob,6,
