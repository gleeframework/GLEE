Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the conversation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still potentially reach a favorable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This high initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counteroffers, I can gauge his level of interest based on his price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have John as a backup who is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His initial jump from $20,000 to $15,000 suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my target to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming for a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also reinforces that I value the product above his initial offer.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This counteroffer ensures I remain above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential further negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $16,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my ideal price and significantly higher than his initial offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** His language suggests he's unlikely to go higher. Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations adds time and uncertainty. Accepting a good offer now is preferable to potentially losing the deal and starting over."
