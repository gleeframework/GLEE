"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $120. This leaves you with a potential profit of only $30 if you buy from her.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Avoiding John:**  John's price is your absolute ceiling, so you don't want to jump to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your desire to negotiate. 
* **Still profitable:** This price is well within your budget and leaves you with a good profit margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice's offer leaves you with a smaller profit margin than you'd like.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate a lower price. Alice's willingness to counter suggests she's open to compromise.
* **Avoiding John:** John's price is your absolute ceiling, so you don't want to jump to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:** This offer is a slight decrease from your previous offer, showing flexibility but not backing down significantly.
* **Finding a middle ground:** This price is closer to Alice's latest offer, potentially prompting a compromise.
* **Still leaving room:** This offer still leaves you with a decent profit margin. 
* **Maintaining momentum:** Continuing the negotiation process keeps the possibility of a good deal alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's come down slightly, her offer is still $10 above your ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. You've shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has also shown flexibility.
* **Avoiding John:** John's price is your fallback option, but you still have time to negotiate a better deal with Alice.  

By rejecting, you keep the possibility of a more favorable outcome open and maintain the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's latest one.
* **Showcasing commitment:**  You've shown a willingness to come up slightly, demonstrating your interest in closing the deal.
* **Still profitable:**  This price allows for a decent profit margin while staying within your budget.
* **Last chance:** This is likely your last chance to make a counteroffer before resorting to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, with only three left. 
* **Alice's inflexibility:** Alice's offers haven't moved much, and she's consistently rejecting your counteroffers.
* **Reaching a compromise:**  Despite your efforts, you're unlikely to secure a price significantly lower than $135 at this point.
* **Avoiding further losses:** While John's offer is higher, it's still within your budget. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting valuable time and might not yield a better outcome. 

It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
