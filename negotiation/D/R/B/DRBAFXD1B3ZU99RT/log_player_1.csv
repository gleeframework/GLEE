Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm open to offers.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to offers, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 keeps me from settling for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$115 is close to my minimum:** While $115 is better than John's offer of $100, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can get a slightly better price by counteroffering.  
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting, I can see if Bob is truly committed to buying at $115 or if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  How about $120?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to try and make the price seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining some leverage:** $120 is still above my minimum, so I'm not giving away too much."
