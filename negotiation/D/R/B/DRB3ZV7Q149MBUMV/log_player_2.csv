"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding terms that work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to send a clear signal that you're looking for a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening establishes your position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear Target:** By stating your target price of $1,000,000 you signal your desired range without immediately revealing your absolute maximum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording remains polite and expresses a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but the price is still too high. We need to keep negotiating to push it closer to our acceptable range.  We are getting closer to John's offer, but we still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. Could you consider something closer to $1,250,000? I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe that price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** We're continuing to edge the price down without making drastic jumps that might alienate Alice.
* **Near Target:**  $1,250,000 puts us close to our maximum budget while still leaving some room for a final concession if needed.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  By expressing eagerness to close the deal and positioning this price as a fair compromise, we encourage Alice to seriously consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen. How about we settle at $1,425,000? This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is definitely getting closer, but we're still above our backup option with John. While time is ticking, we have a few rounds left to try and close that gap further. We're in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. That said, to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $1,300,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging my budgetary constraints."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  We're getting close to John's price, so it's time to hold firm and signal that we're nearing our limit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a clear reason (""budgetary constraints"") reinforces the seriousness of your position.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer aims to encourage Alice to make a final move within a range we can accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,360,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" signaling that she's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Minimal Savings:**  $1,360,000 is only slightly better than John's $1,200,000 offer. The potential savings aren't worth the risk of continued negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, there's a real chance of not reaching an agreement with Alice and missing out on the product entirely.

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
