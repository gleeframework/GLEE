Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product given its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $110? This is a fair price given the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $105 is a good price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
