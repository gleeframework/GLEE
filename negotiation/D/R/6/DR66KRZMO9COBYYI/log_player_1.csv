Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1200000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not going to settle for the bare minimum right away, especially since I know the product's true worth. 

I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap. If Bob refuses, I'll then consider selling to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between the value of the product and my financial constraints. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer. It's still below my ideal price, but it's a good compromise considering the risk of further negotiation. I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and having to sell to John for a lower price. This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and securing a sale."
