"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle somewhere around $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,5,
