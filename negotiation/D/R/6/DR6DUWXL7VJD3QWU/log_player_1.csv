Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  Significantly below his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  Above your minimum acceptable price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  Highlights exclusivity and value while avoiding hardball tactics.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($50,000 below his valuation) while netting you a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can always slightly adjust your price, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Confidence is Key:** Present your offer with confidence and be willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your needs. You have a safety net with John."
