{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is within my target range and represents a good deal.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting further counteroffers or the deal falling apart entirely is higher.  It's time to close this deal and save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
