,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget.  While I'm happy to work with you, $120 just doesn't cover my costs. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, I am still unable to exceed $120 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $122 or $123?",122.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $122 is closer to my price point, but I'm still a little bit off.  Would you be willing to go up to $124? ",124.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose $123 as the final price for the product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",123.0,Bob,6,
