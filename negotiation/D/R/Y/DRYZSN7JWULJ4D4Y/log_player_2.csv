"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good price, it's likely Bob can get an even better deal by negotiating further. There are still 9 rounds left, and Bob has the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer. He's aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,000. This is a good strategy to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she rejects this counteroffer, Bob still has plenty of rounds left to refine his offer and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price and closer to Bob's goal, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already shown his willingness to go lower, and Alice has shown flexibility. It's likely Bob can get an even better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to Alice's offer. He's increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product.  He's also trying to gauge how close he is to Alice's bottom line.  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the option of buying from John open if the deal falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now very close to Bob's target price.  At $8,250, the deal is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer and he'll be left with fewer rounds to reach an agreement.  It's better to secure this good deal than to risk losing the chance entirely."
