Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **""Great deal""**: This emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob. 
* **""Let me know what you think"":** This invites Bob to engage in negotiation, but leaves room for me to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a considerable financial loss for me.  Therefore, rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation is the best strategy to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:**  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **""Understand your budget constraints"":** This acknowledges Bob's financial situation and shows empathy. 
* **""Good deal"":**  Reiterates the value proposition for Bob.
* **""Find a middle ground"":**  This signals willingness to negotiate further while maintaining a firm stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob will be difficult. Selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option and guarantees a good outcome without further risk or time investment in negotiation."
