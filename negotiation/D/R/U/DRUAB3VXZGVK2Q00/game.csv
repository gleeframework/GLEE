,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about $80? It's right in the middle of our last two offers and would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
