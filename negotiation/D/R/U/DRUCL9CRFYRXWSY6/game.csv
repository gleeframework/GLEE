"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $13,000. However, I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $12,500? That would be a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a little less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,750? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,750. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me. However, $13,500 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, Bob. However, $13,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13200.0,Alice,7,
