"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her initial offer allows you to potentially get a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $8,000 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where it might be appealing to her. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still saving you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,500, which is a good price considering your initial goal was to save as much money as possible. Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance you could potentially get a lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing out on a good deal with only 7 rounds left."
