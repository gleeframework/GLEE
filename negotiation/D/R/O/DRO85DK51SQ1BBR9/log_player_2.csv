Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to go down another $500. I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her sticking to her ""final compromise"". It's better to secure the $12,000 price from John than risk paying more with Alice."
