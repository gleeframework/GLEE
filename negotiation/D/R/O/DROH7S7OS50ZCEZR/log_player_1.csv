Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I recommend:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to earn more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

The key is to balance ambition with realism:

* **Being Too Greedy:**  If you ask for close to $1,500,000, you risk offending Bob and losing the sale altogether. 
* **Being Too Conservative:** Offering a price just slightly above $1,000,000 leaves a lot of potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message clearly states your offer and avoids being overly aggressive or passive.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value proposition,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth without explicitly stating his perceived value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Implying other interested parties adds a touch of pressure without being overly pushy.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000  leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being attractive to Bob. It allows room for a counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Your ideal offer might change slightly depending on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
