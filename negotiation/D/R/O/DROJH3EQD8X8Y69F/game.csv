"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds great, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to offer $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, Alice, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $95? I'm sure we can find a price we're both comfortable with.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $95. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to explore other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
