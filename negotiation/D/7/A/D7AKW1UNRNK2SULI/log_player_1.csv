Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential"" aims to justify the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Gauge interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. If he flatly refuses, you can always lower the price or move to John."
