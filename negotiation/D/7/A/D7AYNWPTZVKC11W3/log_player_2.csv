"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,000 is closer to my limit than Alice's initial value, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to see if she'll go lower before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not at my ideal price point. I'm willing to push a little further since John's offer is my safety net."
