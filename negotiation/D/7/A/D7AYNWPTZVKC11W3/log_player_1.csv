Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a price that is above Bob's value of $10,000, giving him an incentive to buy. 
* **It's below my minimum value of $15,000**, leaving room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response.**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob has a reason to negotiate. I'm willing to lower the price a bit to secure a sale, but I won't go below my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's tempting to secure a sale quickly, accepting this offer would result in a considerable loss. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value, perhaps $11,000, to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob continues to insist on a lower price, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a compromise** that is closer to Bob's offer of $9,000 but still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value for both of us.** This encourages Bob to continue negotiating without feeling pressured.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to compromise.** 
* **Position me closer to my desired price point.** 
* **Maintain a positive and collaborative tone** to increase the chances of reaching a deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh the risk of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  At this point, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. It's more likely that we'll continue to haggle back and forth, wasting time and energy.

I've realized that my time is valuable, and it's better to secure a guaranteed $15,000 from John. Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product."
