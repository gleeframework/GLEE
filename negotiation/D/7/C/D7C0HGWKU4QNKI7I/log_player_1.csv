``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects my offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this product. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $12,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely we won't get much closer. While selling to John would net me a bit more, I'm not confident in getting a better offer from Bob, and I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing both buyers."
