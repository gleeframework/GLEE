"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
