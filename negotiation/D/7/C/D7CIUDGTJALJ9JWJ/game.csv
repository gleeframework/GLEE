"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a price of $960000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer?",960000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $960000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $980000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $980000 to me. I'd like to propose a price of $970000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer?",970000.0,Bob,6,
