"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your desire for a good deal, and $950000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product. I'm willing to go down to $975000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $975000 is the right price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best value for my money. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",925000.0,Bob,6,
