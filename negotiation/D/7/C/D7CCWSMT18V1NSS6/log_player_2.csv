"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! If you decline, I'll be happy to sell it to another buyer for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is trying to bluff you. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher price."
