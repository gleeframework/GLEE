Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you're aiming for the best possible deal.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Offering it at $925,000 presents a significant saving for him ($75,000) while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While this offer is strong, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide to negotiate down slightly or hold firm, knowing you have John's offer as a backup."
