"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price point of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and avoids giving away too much value immediately.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By offering $100, I anticipate a counteroffer from Bob.  I'm prepared to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a higher price:** Bob is already showing interest and is willing to pay $90, which is closer to my target price of $120. 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price. I'm not yet at my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Exploring the value gap:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can further explore the value gap between our desired prices and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to the middle ground:** My counteroffer of $95 is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still hold some value.
* **Highlighting the value proposition:** The message emphasizes that $95 is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  This helps to justify the price point and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for one more counteroffer:**  By offering $95, I'm leaving some space for Bob to potentially counteroffer again if necessary, but I'm confident that this price is within the realm of what we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, which would be $92.50. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:**  Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my ideal price point. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good profit. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  With only six rounds remaining, there's a chance that we won't be able to agree on a price. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of a further stalemate or losing the opportunity to sell to John for $80.
* **Maximizing profit:**  While $92.50 is slightly lower than my target price of $120, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, making it a favorable outcome."
