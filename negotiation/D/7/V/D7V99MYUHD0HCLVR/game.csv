"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,312,500?",1312500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly a savvy negotiator, and I respect your approach.  Let's find a number that works for both of us.  How about $1,340,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while still representing a good deal for you.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
