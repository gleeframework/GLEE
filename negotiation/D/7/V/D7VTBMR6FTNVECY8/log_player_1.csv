Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that is $250,000 above the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm confident he'll be interested given the product's value to him, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too far below my minimum price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop significantly lower. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk further haggling with Bob."
