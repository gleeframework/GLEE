Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  That's a great deal, and it's still above what it's worth to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:**  It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it attractive to Bob.
* **It's still profitable:** It's above the value Bob places on the product, ensuring I make a profit.
* **The message is friendly and persuasive:** I highlight the value to Bob and emphasize the potential for a good deal.

This strategy balances my need to make a profit with the desire to potentially sell to Bob at a higher price than I'd get from John."
