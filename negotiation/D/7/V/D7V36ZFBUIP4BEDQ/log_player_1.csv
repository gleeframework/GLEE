Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  That said, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,350,000.  I think this is a fair offer given the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offers, but we're still significantly above his initial offer. Holding firm and countering again keeps the negotiation moving and allows us to gauge his willingness to pay closer to our desired price. We're still above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what I believe is a fair reflection of its worth.  I can come down to $1,625,000.  I think this represents a significant compromise on my part while acknowledging its inherent value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference on our last two offers and land at $1,487,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,487,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,487,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting very close to our backup offer from John.  While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and ensures a sale well above our minimum."
