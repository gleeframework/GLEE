"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  That said, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,350,000.  I think this is a fair offer given the market.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what I believe is a fair reflection of its worth.  I can come down to $1,625,000.  I think this represents a significant compromise on my part while acknowledging its inherent value.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference on our last two offers and land at $1,487,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1487500.0,Bob,6,
