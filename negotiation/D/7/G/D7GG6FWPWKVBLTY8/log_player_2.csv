# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. Let me know if this is a price you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While I could try to negotiate further, $1,050,000 is a good price.  It's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and Alice seems willing to meet me halfway."
