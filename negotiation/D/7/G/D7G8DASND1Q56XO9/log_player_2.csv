Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price, giving you a good starting point and leaving room for a potential compromise.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, but closer. It makes sense to try to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

This offer is a good compromise. It's a significant step closer to your goal of $800,000 and still leaves room for some negotiating wiggle room."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer, but $900,000 is still outside your budget. There's a good chance you can get closer to your target price by negotiating a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This offer is a strong final push, bringing the price just $50,000 above your ideal price. If Alice rejects, you can always fall back to John's offer, knowing you tried your best."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is just $75,000 over your budget. It's a reasonable price, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's likely you won't be able to get a significantly better deal from Alice. You can always purchase from John, but it might be worthwhile to accept this offer and move on."
