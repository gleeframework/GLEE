"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a price closer to his maximum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Bob's absolute limit.  This sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating, potentially getting a lower price or reaching a deal closer to his ideal. He still has 7 rounds to work with, so there's time to explore further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $92.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now close to his limit, but still leaving a small amount of room for negotiation. Offering $88 shows he is serious about buying the product while staying within his budget. It's a moderate increase from his previous offer, signaling that he's ready to compromise, while maintaining a price that remains within his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's maximum.  He has 5 rounds left, and there's potential to negotiate further.  Rejection allows Bob to try and get a price closer to his ideal without needing to immediately buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $88 is the most I can do.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $88.  He's clearly showing a willingness to compromise but isn't willing to budge further.  This reinforces his position and puts pressure on Alice.  He also hints at the possibility of going to John, hoping to motivate Alice to accept the offer."
