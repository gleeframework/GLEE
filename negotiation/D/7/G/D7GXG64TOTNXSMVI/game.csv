"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $92.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $88 is the most I can do.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",88.0,Bob,6,
