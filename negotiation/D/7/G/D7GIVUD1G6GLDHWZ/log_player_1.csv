Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net, ensuring you can make your minimum.

By offering the product at $1,100,000:

* **Potential Profit:** You have the potential to make a $100,000 profit if Bob accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but the message frames it as a ""special price"" to entice him.  

**If Bob rejects the offer:** You'll still sell to John at your desired price."
