"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,400,000? This would allow me to consider the purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's true value while hopefully addressing your budget concerns.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet my budget constraints. However, I must respectfully decline the $1,550,000 offer. I am still aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000. Could we possibly discuss this further to reach a mutually agreeable solution?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
