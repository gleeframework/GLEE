"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a significant amount for the product, given its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this amount, as it's still a good value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's better than selling to John, and there's a good chance we won't reach a better price in the remaining rounds. I'm accepting the offer."
