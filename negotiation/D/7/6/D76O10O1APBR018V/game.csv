"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
