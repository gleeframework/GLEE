"Bob, I understand your position and your budget constraints. While I value your interest in the product, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate this deal. This price still reflects the significant value the product holds for you, while allowing me a fair return on my investment.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
