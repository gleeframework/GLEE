Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $85.  How about we split the difference and do $107.50? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm and her ""final offer"" is still above John's price. While she might be willing to negotiate slightly further, it's unlikely she'll go below $100.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you the best price."
