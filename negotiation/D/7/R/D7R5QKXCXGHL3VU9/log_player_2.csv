The product is worth $120 to me, so I can't afford to pay $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering Alice $110 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth $120 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer of $130 is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120. I'll accept her offer."
