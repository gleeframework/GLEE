"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
