"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice has met my best possible price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as I won't get a better deal."
