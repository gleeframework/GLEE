"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget and there's no point in accepting it. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for a much lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it is still above his maximum budget. He can continue to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for the price he can afford."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I need to make sure this deal works for me.  Could you do $1,425,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If he's not able to get the price down further, he can always buy from John for $1,200,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
