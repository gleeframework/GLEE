"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I need to make sure this deal works for me.  Could you do $1,425,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
