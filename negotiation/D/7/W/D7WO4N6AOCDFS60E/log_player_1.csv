Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,375,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has signaled this is his final offer and he's ready to walk. Accepting $1,375,000 ensures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
