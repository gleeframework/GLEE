Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $140 is higher than your minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value, making it a fair starting point.
* **Shows you're open to a deal:** By offering a price and asking for Bob's opinion, you encourage a back-and-forth exchange. 
* **Prevents you from immediately selling to John:** You're giving Bob the opportunity to make a deal, which might be more profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is still better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum target of $120. I'll try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $135? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, $132 is a good price and above my minimum goal of $120. It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, so it's best to secure the deal at this point."
