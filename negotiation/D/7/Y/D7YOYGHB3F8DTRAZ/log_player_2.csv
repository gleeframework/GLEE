"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still above your maximum budget. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for a lower price. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the discount, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good price for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle on this one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your comfortable range. You've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and with 7 rounds left, it's worth pushing for a better deal.  You can likely get closer to your target of $800,000 by continuing negotiations."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm happy to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $900,000? This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm going to need a little more to make this work for me.  How about $925,000? That's a small step closer to my target, and it still represents a great deal for you. Let's try to close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You've shown a willingness to compromise, and with 5 rounds remaining, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to bargain.  You're also within striking distance of your $800,000 target, and a bit more negotiation could get you there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is closer to your number and still represents a significant savings for me.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $915,000? That's just a slight increase from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but there's still some room for negotiation.  You've shown flexibility, and with only 3 rounds left, it's worth trying to push for a better deal.  You're just $115,000 away from your desired price, and a bit more negotiation could get you there.  If you fail to reach an agreement with Alice, you can still purchase from John, so there's no immediate risk in continuing to negotiate."
