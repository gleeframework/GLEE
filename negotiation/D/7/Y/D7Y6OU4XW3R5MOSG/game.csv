"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow you to get the product at a good price, while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let's try to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,
