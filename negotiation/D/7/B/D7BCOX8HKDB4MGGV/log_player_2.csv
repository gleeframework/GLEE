# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

* Buying from Alice for $12,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000. 
* Although you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not guaranteed, and accepting her offer is still a good deal."
