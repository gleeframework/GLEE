"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $800000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be substantial. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1000000. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This takes into account your valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
