"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $9,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to accommodate your budget, but that's the lowest I can go. This price still offers you a significant value for the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if this revised price works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,200. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose a final price of $10,600. This price reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. Let me know what you think.",10600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $10,400. I'm trying to be reasonable and find a price that works for both of us. If you're willing to come down a bit further, I'd be happy to consider your offer.",10400.0,Bob,6,
