Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $9,500 is unfortunately too far below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to accommodate your budget, but that's the lowest I can go. This price still offers you a significant value for the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if this revised price works for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.

This price reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.
