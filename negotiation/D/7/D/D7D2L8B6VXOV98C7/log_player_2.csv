"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John achieves the same outcome.  There's no reason to risk potentially getting a worse deal with Alice if he's guaranteed to get the product for the same price from John."
