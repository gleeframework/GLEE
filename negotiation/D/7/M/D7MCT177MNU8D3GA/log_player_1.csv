Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm offering $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is still fair to me while showing flexibility to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $180 is a good price, exceeding my minimum and closing the gap between our desired prices.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the sale to John outweighs the potential gain."
