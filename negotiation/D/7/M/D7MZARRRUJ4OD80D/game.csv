"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price point. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try to find a sweet spot between $900000 and $1050000? I'm thinking $950000 could be a good compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again and aim for $1000000.  This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, as it allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I respect your position, but $975000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal.  Let's settle on $1025000.  This price represents a compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. ",1025000.0,Alice,7,
