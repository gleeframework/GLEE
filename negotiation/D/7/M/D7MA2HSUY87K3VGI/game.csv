"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000?  This would still allow you to make a good return on your investment. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Please consider this my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
