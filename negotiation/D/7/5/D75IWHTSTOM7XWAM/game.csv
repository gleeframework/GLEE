"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
