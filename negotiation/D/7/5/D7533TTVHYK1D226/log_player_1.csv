Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, but still secures a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay $12,000. This means you don't have to desperately lowball the price to Bob.

By starting the negotiation at $14,000, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
