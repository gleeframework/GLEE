Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John provides a safety net at $800,000, Bob is willing to pay significantly more. The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'd go below your minimum of $800,000.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price without explicitly revealing his maximum valuation."
