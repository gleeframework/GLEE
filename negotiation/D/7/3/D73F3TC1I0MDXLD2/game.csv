"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, however. Would you consider $13,000? I think that's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
