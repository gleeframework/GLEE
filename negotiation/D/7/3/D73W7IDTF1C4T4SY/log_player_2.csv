"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

It's too expensive at $1,500,000.  Bob should try to negotiate with Alice."

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the price John is offering. This establishes a clear baseline and maximizes his potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above Bob's maximum. He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob should offer a price slightly higher than his maximum, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and forcing him to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal altogether."
