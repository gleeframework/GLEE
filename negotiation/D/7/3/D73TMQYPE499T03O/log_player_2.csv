"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since you're willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
