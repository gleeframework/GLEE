Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
