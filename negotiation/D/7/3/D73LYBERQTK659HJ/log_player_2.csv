"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000), indicating room for negotiation.
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is more expensive than Alice's offer.
* Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially saving more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point.  Would you consider $1,375,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but still higher than my initial counteroffer.

* Rejecting the offer allows for another round of counteroffers, potentially leading to a better deal."
