"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. It's a high-quality item worth over $150 to me. Would you like to explore this opportunity? Let's discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's important to start negotiating from a strong position.  Rejecting the offer allows you to control the negotiation and propose a price more in line with your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $180 is above my budget.  I'm interested in making a deal, but I can only go up to $80 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about considering the product for $100? This is still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $85. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to accept $90 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is getting closer to your target, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating. Remember, you have a backup option with John at $80, so you don't need to settle for a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $90 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87}
