"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. It's a high-quality item worth over $150 to me. Would you like to explore this opportunity? Let's discuss it further.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on your product, $180 is above my budget.  I'm interested in making a deal, but I can only go up to $80 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about considering the product for $100? This is still a premium price, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value I place on the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $85. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to accept $90 for it. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties involved.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $90 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. What do you say?",87.0,Bob,6,
