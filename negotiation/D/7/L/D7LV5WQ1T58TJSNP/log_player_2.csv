"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. He has 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm hoping to pay closer to $950,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's a better price than her first offer, it's still higher than his ideal price point. He has more rounds to negotiate, and there's potential for Alice to come down further.  It's not worth risking going to John at this point, especially since he can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price is fair, and we can both walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,020,000? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 5 rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice might be willing to budge further to avoid losing the deal.  Going to John at this point would mean paying more than he has to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,010,000. This price is only a little below your offer, and I think we can both find this to be a fair and reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 1010000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a competitive price, and it's still a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good deal for him, considering he can get the product for $1,015,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  While there is still room for negotiation, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and he only has 3 rounds left.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and saves him a significant amount of money."
