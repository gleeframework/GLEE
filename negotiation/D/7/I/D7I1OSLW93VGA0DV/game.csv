"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $107? This would be a good deal for both of us.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $109. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",109.0,Alice,5,
