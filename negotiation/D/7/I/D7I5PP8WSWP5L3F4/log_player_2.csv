"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to him. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum value ($120) as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice an incentive to accept while also leaving some wiggle room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There are still rounds left, so Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  While buying from John for $120 is a safe option, Bob is still hoping to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This is a good strategy to potentially reach an agreement quickly. Offering $110 is a midpoint between Bob's previous offer of $105 and Alice's latest offer of $115, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $112.5 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. With multiple rounds left, there's still an opportunity for further negotiation. Bob is motivated to save even a few dollars more, making it worth rejecting Alice's current offer and continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to Alice's price while still maintaining a strong negotiating position. Offering $111 is a small increase from his previous offer, showcasing his willingness to compromise but also demonstrating that he's not willing to cave in completely. This tactic could potentially lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still hoping for a lower price, Alice's offer of $112 is getting closer to his ideal price and there are only a few rounds left. It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might raise the price again or become less willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a worse deal. Accepting the offer secures the purchase at a price that is still within Bob's budget, and he can move on to other things."
