"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves you with a significant profit.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
