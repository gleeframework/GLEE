"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm countering with $85. This is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is now offering my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept the offer and move on."
