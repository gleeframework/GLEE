"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for Bob to buy from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
