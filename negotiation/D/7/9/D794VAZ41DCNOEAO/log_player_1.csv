{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is still within Bob's range of willingness to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This allows room for negotiation without dropping below your minimum of $10,000.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By opening with a price less than your maximum, you're signaling that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  While $8,750 is tempting, I'm going to counter Bob's offer again and try to get closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $8,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us finally make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it seems unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to move on and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
