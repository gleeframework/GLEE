Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him for $1,200,000, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I'm not sure if I can get him up to $1,400,000, but I'm willing to try."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  He's come up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my ideal price of $1,400,000 than what John is offering.  While I'd love to get even more, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  This is a good outcome."
