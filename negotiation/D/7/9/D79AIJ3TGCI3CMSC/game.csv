"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $950000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $920000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
