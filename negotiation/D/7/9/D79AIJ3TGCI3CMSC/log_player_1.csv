{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a good return on your investment.

Remember, negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still lower than what I would ideally like to get. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $920000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is still a significant profit for me and significantly less than what the product is worth to him.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal, and it's important to close a deal when there's a win-win scenario."
