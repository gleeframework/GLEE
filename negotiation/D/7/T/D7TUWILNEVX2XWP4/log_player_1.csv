"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value to see if I can push for a higher price. I am also aware of John's offer and I can walk away at any time to get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll offer $12,500, which is a reasonable compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. It's only round 4, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  I'm also aware that John is waiting to buy at $12,000, which is a good safety net if this negotiation doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to stick with it.  I'm aware I can always sell to John at this price if Bob continues to refuse.  I'm hoping that the fact that we're nearing the middle ground will make Bob consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned that we're not making significant progress.  We're already halfway through the rounds, and I want to ensure I get at least my minimum value. John's offer guarantees that, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially miss out on a guaranteed sale."
