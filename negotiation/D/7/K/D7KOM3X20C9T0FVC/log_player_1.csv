Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to make a serious offer, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold quickly enough.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
