"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $650000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $650000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $600000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $620000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",620000.0,Alice,5,
