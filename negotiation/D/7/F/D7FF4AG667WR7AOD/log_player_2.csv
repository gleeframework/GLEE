Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below $130.  At this point, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed deal from John at $120 and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
