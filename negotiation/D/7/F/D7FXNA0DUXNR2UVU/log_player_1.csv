Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

While Bob is showing interest, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
