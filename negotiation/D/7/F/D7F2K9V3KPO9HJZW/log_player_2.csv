"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and rarity, we believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you. However, considering the current market conditions and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction, I am extending a special offer to you. For a limited time, you have the chance to own this exceptional item for $950,000. This offer represents a significant savings of $250,000 compared to its full value, making it an attractive proposition for discerning buyers like yourself. I look forward to discussing the details further and potentially securing this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially leading to a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
