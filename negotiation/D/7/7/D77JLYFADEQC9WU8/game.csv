"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a bit more on the sale.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $112. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
