"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still beyond my budget. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $8,000.  While continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer, it's unlikely to be significantly more than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome at this point."
