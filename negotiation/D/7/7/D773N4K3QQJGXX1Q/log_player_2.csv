Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is still a great compromise. It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $100.  At this point, it's more strategic to take the guaranteed good deal from John rather than risk the negotiation with Alice going south and ending up with nothing."
