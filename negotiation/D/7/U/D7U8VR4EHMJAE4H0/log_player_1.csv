Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $800,000, so you'll be making a profit even if John ends up being your buyer.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting in the middle ground, you create an opportunity for negotiation and potentially increase your earnings."
