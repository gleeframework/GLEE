"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $11,800?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $11,800 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,200.  I think this is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",12200.0,Alice,5,
