{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even higher. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can negotiate a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired amount. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. This is a valuable product, and I believe we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I hope this is a price that you can consider reasonable while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,100,000. I believe we can still find common ground and reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,087,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,070,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price of $1,100,000, we're running out of rounds.  I'm not confident that Bob will increase his offer enough to make me comfortable with the deal.  Therefore, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most logical decision at this point. It guarantees a sale and ensures I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
