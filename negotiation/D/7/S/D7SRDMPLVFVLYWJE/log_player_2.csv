# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value and quality. This product is not just an item; it's an experience designed to enhance your daily life. Given its unique features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its high-quality standards and the satisfaction it promises, I kindly invite you to consider purchasing it for $120. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it at $120, you can get the same product for the same price from John. It's not beneficial to buy from Alice since there's no potential for saving money."
