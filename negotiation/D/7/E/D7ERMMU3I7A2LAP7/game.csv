"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, your asking price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,600,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
