"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  There's a risk that rejecting the offer could lead to a higher price or a stalemate, so accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a good price."
