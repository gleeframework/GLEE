"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $900,000 for this exceptional opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's best to try negotiating a lower price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I recognize the value of your product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below our $800,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In order to meet somewhere in the middle, I am proposing a revised price of $850,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise considering both the value of the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our walk-away price from John. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm afraid I can't meet that number. Would you consider $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

We're nudging our offer up slightly to show willingness to compromise, but we're still well within a reasonable range of John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am proposing a final offer of $825,000 for the product. This price aims to balance the value of the product with your budgetary constraints while maximizing the value for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and it's getting close to John's price. However, we still have some room to negotiate and every dollar saved is a win. We'll push one more time and see if Alice is bluffing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concessions you've made. To be completely transparent, I have another option available at a lower price point. However, I value your product and our communication throughout this process.  If you're willing to meet me at $780,000, I'm prepared to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 780000
}
```

This message does several things:

1. **Acknowledges Alice's final offer:** Shows we're taking her seriously.
2. **Introduces competition:**  Subtly lets her know there's a reason we're holding firm without revealing our exact walk-away price.
3. **Expresses positive sentiment:**  Keeps the tone collaborative and suggests we're willing to close if she meets our price.
4. **Presents a strong final offer:**  This is a significant jump from our last offer, signaling we're serious about closing at this price. 

This is a calculated risk, as Alice could walk away. However, it gives us the best chance of getting the product below John's price while maintaining a good relationship with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your detailed response and understanding throughout this negotiation. I am willing to accept a price of $800,000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met our price! This is the best possible outcome - we secured the product at the same price as John's offer, but we built a rapport with Alice through negotiation."
