,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would be a great price for you, and a fair deal for me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're willing to come up a bit, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $975000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",975000.0,Alice,5,
