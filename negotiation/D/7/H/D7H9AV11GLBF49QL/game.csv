Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $12000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. If we can't agree on a price closer to that, I'll have to consider my other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this unique product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  If we can't reach an agreement closer to that, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique product, and I think it's worth the investment. Let's meet in the middle at $10000.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down to $10000, but that's still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9750.  If we can't agree on a price closer to that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",9750.0,Bob,8,
