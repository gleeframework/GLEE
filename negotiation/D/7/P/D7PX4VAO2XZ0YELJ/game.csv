"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth that investment.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,250 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also buy an additional service from you that's worth $500. Would you be willing to accept $8,750 for the product and the service?",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and the offer for the additional service.  However, $8,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $8,500 for the product and the service. This will give you a great deal and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8,500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer.",8250.0,Bob,8,
