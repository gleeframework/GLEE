The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $115.  There's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is now offering $110, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer."
