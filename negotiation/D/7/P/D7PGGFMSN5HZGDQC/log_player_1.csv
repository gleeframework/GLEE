{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it gives me room to negotiate.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is close to my minimum, I think I can still push for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, it's a sweet spot that Bob will find acceptable."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel there's room for negotiation. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm getting closer to my minimum, so I'll need to be careful with my next offer."

```

I'm countering with $18,000.  This is a very small step down from my last offer, but I'm feeling the pressure to get a deal done. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000.  Bob's counteroffer is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can push for a higher price.  I'd rather guarantee the sale and avoid further negotiation."
