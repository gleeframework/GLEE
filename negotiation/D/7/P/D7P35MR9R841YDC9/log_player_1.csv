"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $7,000 is too low, and I can still get $10,000 from John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a fair price for me, and it's closer to the value I know the product has.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $8,500 is still not a good price for me, and I'm not sure how much higher Bob is willing to go. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise from my last offer, but still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate now, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if he doesn't come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not too worried about running out of time, as I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is my final offer. I'm getting closer to John's price, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If Bob doesn't accept, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a little below what I'd like, and I'm running out of time. I'm confident that John will buy it for $10,000, which is a good enough price for me."
