"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's much closer to her value than mine. I need to negotiate or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for my budget right now. I could do $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the realm of possibility. It gives me room to negotiate upward while making it clear I'm looking for a much better deal.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a low number first, I'm attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm aware this offer is unlikely to be accepted, but it leaves ample space for Alice to counter and for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Room:** However, $90 is still above my maximum price, and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Delay:** By rejecting again, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to drop her price further as we approach the end of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm raising my offer to show Alice I'm negotiating in good faith and willing to move towards her price.
* **Staying Below John:**  $70 is still a significant savings compared to buying from John, leaving me room to negotiate a bit further if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be and how close we can get to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is slightly above my ideal price, but it's a reasonable compromise, especially considering Alice started at $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might get the price down a little more, but it also risks Alice walking away or me wasting time for minimal savings.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John would save me $5, but accepting Alice's offer gets me the product I presumably prefer. In this case, the potential $5 savings isn't worth the risk of losing out on Alice's product."
