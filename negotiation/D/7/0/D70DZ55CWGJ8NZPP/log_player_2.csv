# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Consider this - you'll be getting a product worth $1,000,000 to you for a price that's significantly lower.  Let me know your decision. If you decline, I'll be selling to another buyer for $1,500,000.
