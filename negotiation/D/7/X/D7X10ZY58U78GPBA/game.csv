"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not quite convinced that the product is worth $1,600,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,500,000. This revised offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's settle on $1,425,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, but I still think $1,425,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
