Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation. However, I'm confident that I can get at least $100 from John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want and I can easily get more from John. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with $100. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $80. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
