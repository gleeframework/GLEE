"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation of $12,000, Bob can do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John for $8,000. There's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start with a significant counteroffer that shows his willingness to negotiate but also sets a strong price point.
* **Fairness:** He frames the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's desire for a quick and agreeable deal. 
* **Strategic Move:** This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if necessary, while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** Bob's goal is to get the product for $8,000. Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to his target, but still too high.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price, especially since he knows John is willing to sell for $8,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, Bob maintains his leverage and demonstrates his willingness to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000. How about we settle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:**  Bob is making a small, incremental counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Appeal to Efficiency:** Highlighting the ""quick finalization"" of the deal puts pressure on Alice to accept and avoid further negotiation.
* **Maintain a Buffer:**  $9,250 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, leaving room for Alice to potentially make another counteroffer, but keeps Bob in a comfortable position."
