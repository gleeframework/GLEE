"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit too high for me.  How about $9000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9000. How about we settle at $9250? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly.",9250.0,Bob,4,
