Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still considering the potential for rejection. Here's why:

* **The value to you:** You value the product at $1,000,000, so you are willing to sell it for at least that amount.
* **The potential buyer John:**  Knowing John will pay $1,000,000 guarantees you won't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Maximizing potential profit:** By setting the price at $1,500,000, you give Bob a significant incentive to buy if he values the product higher.

**Important Note:** This approach is based on limited information about Bob's valuation. A more sophisticated approach would involve gathering information about Bob's needs and possibly using negotiation strategies. However, with the provided context, this offer offers a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
