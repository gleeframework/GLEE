Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,075,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,075,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offers are getting lower and lower, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get him to my minimum price within the remaining rounds.  John is a sure bet for $1,200,000, which is closer to what I want."
