``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm aiming for the highest price possible while still ensuring a deal with Bob. I've kept in mind that John is willing to pay $10,000, so I'm not going to settle for anything below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good value for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $11,500 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not going to let Bob dictate the terms. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I want to make this happen.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $11,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one. While $11,000 is less than I hoped for, it's still $1,000 more than selling to John. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and the gap is narrowing.  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer. I think it's best to accept and secure the sale."
