"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a starting price of $16,000.  I'm confident it's worth the value, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lowball offer, but it's still within the realm of reason given that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving Bob a significant discount from Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with.  He could also choose to buy from John if he feels he won't be able to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but is still trying to secure a good deal.  Offering $10,000 shows that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible. This offer also leaves room for negotiation and the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than previous offers, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Bob can get the product from John for his maximum price of $8,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and further negotiation could result in a wasted time and potentially an even higher price from Alice. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids potential risks."
