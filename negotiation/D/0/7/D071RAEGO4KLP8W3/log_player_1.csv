Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I still feel like I can get a better price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup some of my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,000. This is the highest I can go, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he'll either walk away or counter with a lower price.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a sale and a decent amount of money."
