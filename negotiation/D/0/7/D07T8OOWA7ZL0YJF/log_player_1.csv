Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Show Confidence:**  By expressing your confidence in the product's value, you might influence Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves ample space for negotiation and potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value than yours. While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, there's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap and potentially get closer to your desired outcome. Selling to John guarantees your minimum, but leaving the negotiation table now might mean leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, the product's worth to me is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,500,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We're making a concession from the initial price but justifying it with the product's inherent value. This demonstrates flexibility while reinforcing your position.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, aiming for a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Above Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above your minimum acceptable price, providing  room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,450,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but the gains from further negotiation are likely to be small. It's often better to secure a good deal than risk it for a marginally better one. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations has a cost in terms of time and potential risk. Accepting now allows you to move on to other opportunities."
