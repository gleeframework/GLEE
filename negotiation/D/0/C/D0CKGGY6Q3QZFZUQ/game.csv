,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However,  $1,350,000 still leaves me at a significant loss. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit. Let's settle at $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that will allow both of us to walk away happy.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we make one final push at $1,400,000? That's the highest I can go.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
