"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize potential profit.  Starting at $1,150,000 gives us room to negotiate downwards while still staying well above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it attractive but leaving space for bargaining.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging open communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum, it's still a significant amount below what we believe we can get. We're only in round 2, and we have room to negotiate.  We'll counter with a price closer to our starting point to see if we can push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and the conversation. I understand your perspective, but I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,120,000?"",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer meets Bob closer to the middle of our previous offers. It shows a willingness to negotiate but still aims for a higher price point.
* **Strong Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value as justification for the higher price without being overly aggressive.
* **Open to Continued Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, suggesting we're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a price I feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a good sign. However, the current offer is still below our target range, and we have plenty of rounds left. By rejecting and countering, we signal that we're aiming for a higher price while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a clean split of the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,075,000) and our previous counter ($1,120,000).  This demonstrates significant movement on our part while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we highlight the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While we're still being patient, mentioning a compromise could signal that we're getting closer to a point where we might consider John's offer if an agreement can't be reached soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,087,500 is a significant amount above our minimum price and a solid profit. While we could potentially push for more, the difference is becoming smaller.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer and actively seeking a compromise, indicating he's serious about the purchase.
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point of our negotiation rounds. Holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer.

Accepting at this point secures a great deal and avoids the potential downside of continued negotiation."
