"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's not worth accepting.  It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation while still making it clear that I'm serious about acquiring the product but not at Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my target. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a lower price. Buying from John is always an option, but I'm not ready to commit to that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my absolute maximum budget. If Alice doesn't accept this price, I'll purchase from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product. This shows a clear commitment to buying, but also a firm stance on my price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget. There's a chance she might continue lowering the price, but at this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at my maximum acceptable price, saving me time and potential frustration."
