Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to potentially gain significantly more than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth a premium. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts,"" you signal that you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John at your guaranteed price."
