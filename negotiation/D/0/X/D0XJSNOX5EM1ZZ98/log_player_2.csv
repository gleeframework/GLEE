Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. He should counter with a lower offer and try to close the gap."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's slightly higher than his last counteroffer, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John and getting a much better price than Alice's initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process on and potentially lead to a worse outcome."
