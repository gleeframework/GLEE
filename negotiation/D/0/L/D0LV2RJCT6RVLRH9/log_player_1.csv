"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering the price, but I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to secure a price closer to my initial target. I hope this will be enough to convince him, but I'm prepared to go through further rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a higher offer, but I'm also starting to consider the risk of losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,850,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm not giving in completely. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to him, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is above my minimum, I feel like I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left. I'm going to counter with an offer closer to $1,700,000 to see if we can find some middle ground.  I'm also starting to seriously consider the possibility of selling to John if we can't reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. I'm  trying to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's, hoping this will finally be acceptable to him.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise or risk losing both Bob and the opportunity for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum price, I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob. It's better to secure a deal at a lower price than risk losing the sale completely."
