"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Bob,4,
