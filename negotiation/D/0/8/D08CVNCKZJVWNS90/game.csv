"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I agree the product has potential, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  This is the most I can afford at this time, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
