{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still making a substantial profit.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and recognizes Bob's potential gain from the product. This can help build rapport and encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, as indicated by the ""Let me know what you think"" statement. This suggests flexibility and can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum. This allows me to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a higher price closer to $950,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob's offer is lower than my ideal, but it still gives me room to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price closer to my target.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price in the middle ground between our current offers."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and while $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price that recognizes your potential gain while allowing me to make a worthwhile profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a compromise price that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the potential value of the product for Bob, reinforcing the rationale behind the price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the need for an agreement, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Room for Flexibility:**  This price is still above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  I'm still aiming for a higher price, ideally closer to $900,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap between our desired prices.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both parties, recognizing Bob's budget while ensuring a reasonable profit for myself.
* **Urgency:** I use phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as a final offer, which might make Bob feel pressured to accept. 

**Next Step:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider if I'm willing to go any lower or if I'm better off selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to pay $880,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is only $10,000 below my previous offer, bringing us very close to a deal. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  There's a high risk of Bob backing out entirely if I reject his offer. He's shown a willingness to negotiate but might decide it's not worth the effort if I continue to refuse.
* **Significant Profit:**  While not my ideal price, $880,000 is still a significant profit and well above my minimum of $800,000.  

**Conclusion:**  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal that ensures a solid profit than to risk losing him as a buyer and potentially needing to sell to John at a lower price."
