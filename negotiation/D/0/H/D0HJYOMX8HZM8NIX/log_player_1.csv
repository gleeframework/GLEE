"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is too low, and while I could try to negotiate him up, it's not worth the risk of him walking away or the time it would take. John offers a guaranteed $150, which meets my minimum."
