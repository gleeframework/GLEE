"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its potential value to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
