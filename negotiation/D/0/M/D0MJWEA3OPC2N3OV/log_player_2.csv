"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000) but still leaves significant room for negotiation. As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."

Round 2

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. While I value this product, $1,225,000 is still a stretch for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my target price, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer would mean securing the product at a reasonable price, especially considering the alternative of paying $1,500,000 to John. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's in my best interest to accept and avoid risking a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
