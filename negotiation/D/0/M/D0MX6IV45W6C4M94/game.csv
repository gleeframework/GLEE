"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10000 to me, and I'm willing to make some concessions to get it to the right buyer.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you're making. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $8000 to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the concessions you're making. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
