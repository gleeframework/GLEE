"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your target price of $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have room for further negotiation and can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer.  You're still better off than buying from John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $2,000 higher than your ideal price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance she won't budge much further.  Since John is offering the product at your target price, it's now the most financially sensible option.  It's better to secure the product at a price you're happy with rather than risk getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation with Alice."
