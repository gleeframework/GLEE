"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,500 is far above his budget and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $13,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
