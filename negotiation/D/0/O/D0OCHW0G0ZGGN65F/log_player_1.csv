Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 creates a significant profit margin for you ($125,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from countering with a much lower offer.

By aiming high but leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, you maximize your chances of securing a highly profitable sale."
