"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy with the product but I'm hoping we can find a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering your own valuation, and allows me to stay within my financial constraints. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my own valuation. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm ready to pay $1,225,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and ensures we both walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own valuation. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. If not, I'll need to consider other options.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
