"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a substantial amount. While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a potentially favorable price. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not sure if the product is worth $2,000,000 to me, and I'm not sure if I want to pay that much. Since I know I can get the product from John for $800,000, I will reject Alice's offer.
