Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I create an opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my target price and below what I can get from John. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I can likely push Bob closer to my price point with a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. If he rejects, I'll reassess based on how firm he seems on that price. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for Bob and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Reiterate my needs:**  I'm reminding Bob that I need to get a certain price to make the sale worthwhile.

**Why this strategy?**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while inching closer to my desired price point.  By being reasonable and flexible, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this offer. If not, I'm prepared to continue the negotiation or ultimately sell to John."
