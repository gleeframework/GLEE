Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting High:**  A common negotiation tactic is to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance of a price closer to your target.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it emphasizes ""value and potential,"" subtly implying he should be willing to pay a premium.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:**  If Alice's initial offer is too high, Bob might perceive it as unreasonable and refuse to negotiate further.
* **Alternative Tactics:** Alice could adopt a different strategy, like offering a smaller discount or highlighting the product's benefits to justify the higher price."
