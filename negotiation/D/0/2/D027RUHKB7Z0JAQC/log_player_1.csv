Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. While $875,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it's slightly above what I'm willing to pay. Could we possibly meet at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $825,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly more than my minimum ($800,000) and keeps the negotiation moving swiftly.  There's a risk Bob could walk away if I push further."
