"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is higher than your minimum of $800,000, so you're already starting with a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,000,000 is below Bob's maximum of $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate if he wants to, but it's still a good deal for him.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This offer opens the door for Bob to counter, allowing you to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $900000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 and still leaves some room for negotiation in future rounds.  

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal.  While there's a chance you could get a higher price by rejecting the offer, it's not worth the risk of losing this deal and potentially having to settle for the $800,000 offer from John."
