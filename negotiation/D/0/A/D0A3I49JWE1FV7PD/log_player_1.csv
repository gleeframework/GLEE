{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive price for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to the product's worth to her ($12,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While knowing Bob values it at $8,000 is helpful, it's unlikely he'd accept an offer close to that. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below Alice's minimum ($11,999) leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John guarantees Alice her minimum price. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is a rational buyer. If Alice knows Bob is prone to impulsive purchases, she might try an even higher initial offer.
* **Market Conditions:**  This strategy assumes a degree of scarcity. If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Alice might need to adjust her approach."
