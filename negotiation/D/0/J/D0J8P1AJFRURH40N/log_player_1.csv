Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial price is $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price by counteroffering.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to the $13,000 mark with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $11,000 is a fair starting point, I believe we can find a number that works better for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle at $12,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a fair compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $10,000 and is close to my counteroffer of $12,000.  It's important to remember that I still have some rounds left to negotiate, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and allows me to move on."
