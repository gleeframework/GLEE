"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm confident it will serve you well. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you consider something closer to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
