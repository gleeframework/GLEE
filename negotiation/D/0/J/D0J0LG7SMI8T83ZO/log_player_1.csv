Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm confident it will serve you well. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you consider something closer to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective on the price. While $10,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle around $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reasoning: While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, accepting $11,500 is a better outcome than risking a failed negotiation and getting $12,000 from John.
