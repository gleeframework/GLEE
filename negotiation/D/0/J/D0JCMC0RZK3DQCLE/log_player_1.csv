"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Being optimistic:**  I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product and hoping Bob will be enticed by the ""great deal.""
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message makes it clear I'm open to discussion. This keeps the negotiation going and avoids an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm not in a rush. 

**Next Round:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes a desire for a ""compromise,"" keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a bit less. I am willing to pay $97 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Close to the finish line:**  We're getting close to a potential deal, and I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I believe there's still room for a slightly better deal with Bob.

**Next Round:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than $97."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll go down to $101.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's just a few dollars more than you're offering. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This message emphasizes a desire to reach a compromise, making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Focusing on the ""few"" dollars:** Highlighting the small difference in price creates a sense of urgency and can encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, implying that the price is fair.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I am willing to pay $98 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and Bob's offers are stubbornly close to my minimum.
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer has only increased by $1 in the last two rounds, indicating he's not willing to budge much.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $100 profit, which is a safer and more efficient choice at this point.

While I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I'm satisfied with the $100 from John, which meets my minimum requirement."
