Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Justifying Value:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message implies the product is worth a significant amount (""given its value"").

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant.  You have a strong fallback position with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
