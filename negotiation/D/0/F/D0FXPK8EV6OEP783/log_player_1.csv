Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves room for negotiation and prevents you from losing out on a potentially higher offer. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible but assertive. You want to get the best price possible while still keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take the $9,000, you can likely do better with further negotiation.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Your minimum:**  Your product is worth at least $12,000 to you.  Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss.
* **John's offer:**  You have a guaranteed $12,000 from John. This gives you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your minimum and potentially get a better deal. 

Let's see if you can get closer to your target price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:** It's a significant drop from your previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** It's above your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out on value.
* **Focus on value:** It highlights the deal Bob is getting by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive tone:** It maintains a friendly and open dialogue, keeping the negotiation constructive. 

This counteroffer is designed to encourage Bob to come up a bit more without completely closing the door on a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still not enough to cover your value. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, so there's no need to settle for a lower price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Offer:** You have a surefire way to earn $12,000. There's no risk in waiting for a better offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** It's possible Bob might increase his offer if you counter again, but there's also a chance the negotiation could stall.
* **Time Factor:**  There's no mention of time constraints in this scenario, so you have the luxury to wait and see if a better deal emerges.

It's best to stick with your plan of selling to John. You're not under pressure to accept a price below your minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept. Let's try to split the difference.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,125? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. "", ""product_price"": 10125} 
```

Here's the breakdown of this counteroffer:

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  It frames the offer as a good investment for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  It maintains a friendly and collaborative approach to negotiation.

This counteroffer is a calculated move that keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining your target price."
