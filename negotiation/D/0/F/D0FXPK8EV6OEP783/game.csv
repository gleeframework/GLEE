"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept. Let's try to split the difference.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,125? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. ",10125.0,Alice,5,
