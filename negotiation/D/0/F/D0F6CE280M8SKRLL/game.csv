"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Is this something you'd be interested in?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product to me. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $14000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Is this something you'd consider?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's close the deal and move on. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. However, I'm only comfortable paying $11000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $12500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still below my initial price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,9,
