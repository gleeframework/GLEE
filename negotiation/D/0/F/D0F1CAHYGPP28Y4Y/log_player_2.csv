"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. 

* **Rejecting** Alice's offer means Bob will buy the product from John for $10,000. This is higher than what Bob wants to spend, but still cheaper than accepting Alice's $9,000 offer."
