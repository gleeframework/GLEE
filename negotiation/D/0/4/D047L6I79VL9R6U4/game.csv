"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $13,250? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",13250.0,Bob,4,
