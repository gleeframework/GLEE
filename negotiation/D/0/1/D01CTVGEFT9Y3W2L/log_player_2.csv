"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
