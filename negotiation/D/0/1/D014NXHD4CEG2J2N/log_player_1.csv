Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  The message lightly justifies the high price by mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly anchoring it in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains open for discussion and invites Bob's feedback, fostering a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere.

By starting high, Alice gives herself the best chance to maximize her profit. Even if Bob negotiates down, she's likely to secure a better price than her guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
