"Bob, I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate the compromise, I am still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. I hope we can find a solution that respects my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9,500, which is still a discount from my initial offer, but it's getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've made a significant concession, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is my lowest price, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me here.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your final counteroffer. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. However, I must stick to my budget. I propose a final counteroffer of $8,500, which is the highest I can go while still respecting my financial limits.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need you to meet me at $9,000. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,9,
