"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject and see if a counter-offer is possible.  Buying from John is an option, but it's a last resort as it's the highest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true value while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise.  It's likely that further negotiation will lead to more rounds and potentially a higher price.  Accepting this offer saves time and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
