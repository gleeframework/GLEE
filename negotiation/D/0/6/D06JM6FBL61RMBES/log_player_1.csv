Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I believe it can be truly transformative for your business.  My initial price is $1,750,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $1,500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping to find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for my business, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I can't go above $1,550,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already four rounds in. There's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, and it's a good compromise considering the time spent."
