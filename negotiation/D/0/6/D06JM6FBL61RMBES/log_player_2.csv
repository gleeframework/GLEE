# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping to find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business.  Let's work together to close this deal.

Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
