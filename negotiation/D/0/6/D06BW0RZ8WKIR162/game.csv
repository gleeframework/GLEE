"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  I'm willing to pay $115 for the product.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That way we both get a fair deal.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $117.50.  Would you consider $116?  It's closer to my budget, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",116.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $116 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle again, how about $116.75?  It's just a small step up from your last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",116.75,Alice,5,
