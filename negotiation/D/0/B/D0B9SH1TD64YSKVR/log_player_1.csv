Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's more than what the product is worth to him, but less than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,250. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping to close the gap and reach an agreement that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  This is getting too time-consuming and I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John."
