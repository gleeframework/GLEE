Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  My asking price is $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value I've placed on this product. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to emphasize its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Backup Option:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me the confidence to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While his offer is below my minimum, it's still within the range where negotiation is worthwhile. 
* **John as Leverage:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to push for a higher price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is closer to my desired amount while still remaining appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value,  I'm still confident in the unique value of this product and its potential benefits for your operations.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value while also being within a range that could benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I frame the counteroffer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the potential benefits for both of us. 
* **Leverage:**  Knowing John's offer keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in the previous round. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has remained steadfast at his initial offer of $1,050,000. 
* **Minimum Threshold:**  This price is below my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a quick and secure transaction.

**Conclusion:**

While it's always tempting to try to squeeze out a higher price, in this situation, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential risk of continued negotiation with Bob."
