I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I would have liked to get a higher price from Bob, it's becoming clear that we are too far apart in our valuations. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is too high. It's better to secure the sale to John and ensure a guaranteed profit."
