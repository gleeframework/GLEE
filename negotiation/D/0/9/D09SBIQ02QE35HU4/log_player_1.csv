Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a bit more.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, so I'll see if I can close the deal with Bob."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $11,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
