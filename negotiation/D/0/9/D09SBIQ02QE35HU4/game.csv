"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,500?  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $11,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my budget.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $11,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise. How about $11,100?  It's a small step up, but it's the last concession I can offer.  Let me know what you think.",11100.0,Alice,7,
