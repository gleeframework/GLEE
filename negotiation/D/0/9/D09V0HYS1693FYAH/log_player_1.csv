Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you can afford to start high. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. His response will give you valuable information about his perception of the product's value.
* **Room for negotiation:** The high price leaves room for negotiation.  You can always come down if Bob objects, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Maximizing profit:** If Bob accepts, you've significantly increased your profit beyond your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting point slightly lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might start with a slightly less aggressive offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving you room to maneuver and secure the sale."
