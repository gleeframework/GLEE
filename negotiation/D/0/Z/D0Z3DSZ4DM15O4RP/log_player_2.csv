"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He has a better option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting, Bob can start the negotiation and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. However, it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate, leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  Although it's a compromise, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  With John offering the product for $1,000,000, Bob should take the guaranteed deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
