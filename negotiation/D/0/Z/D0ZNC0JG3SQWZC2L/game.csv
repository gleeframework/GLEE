"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? ",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500? This feels like a fair deal considering its value.",862500.0,Alice,5,
