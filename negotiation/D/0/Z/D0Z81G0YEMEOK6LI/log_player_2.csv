"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above my personal maximum value for the product. I want to try and get a lower price. It's worth risking the negotiation to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is within my acceptable range and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out, the risk of her rejecting further counteroffers and me having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
