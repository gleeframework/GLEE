I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good buffer above my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested at this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is pretty close to what I'm willing to accept.  It's better than selling to John, so I'll take it."
