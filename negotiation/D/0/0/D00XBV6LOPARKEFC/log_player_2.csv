"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you my unique product for $120. It is a valuable item worth more than what you're willing to pay, and I believe this price reflects its true value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering your product.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I must maintain the integrity of my product's value. I am unable to accept $100 for it. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle, and $110 is a reasonable price saving $10 off the maximum.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
