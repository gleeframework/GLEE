Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Safety Net:** I know I can get $120 from John, so any offer to Bob should be significantly above that to be worthwhile. 
* **Psychology:** Offering a price slightly below his perceived value, and framing it as a ""great deal,"" might make Bob feel like he's getting a good bargain and encourage him to accept."
