Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product holds significant value for both Alice and Bob ($1,500,000 each), starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know if you'd like to discuss further"" signals willingness to negotiate, which can be important in securing a deal.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she can sell the product for its base value if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
