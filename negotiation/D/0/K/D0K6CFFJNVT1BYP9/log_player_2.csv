"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering your interest and the value you see in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price is a good balance for both our needs and reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to get closer to my desired price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob has already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely Alice will budge further.  It's best for Bob to buy from John at $800,000 to stay within his budget."
