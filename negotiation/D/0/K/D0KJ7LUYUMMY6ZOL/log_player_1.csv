``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and optimistic message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I highlight the value of the product to emphasize its worth. 

This strategy aims to set a strong initial position while still being open to negotiation. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and my desire to maximize my profits while still making a deal within the 10 rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I have a better chance of getting closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  

* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the pressure on him to increase his bid. 
* **Time is on My Side:** With 10 rounds, I have ample time to negotiate. 
* **John as a Backstop:** Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than his current offer. I'll aim to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiations moving towards my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  

* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since we're only on round 4. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup option with John, which gives me the flexibility to keep negotiating.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 6 more rounds, I have ample time to find a better deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to make a deal with you, $1,250,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1,250,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet.  

* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I still have time to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which gives me the security to hold out for a better deal from Bob.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  I can use John's offer as leverage to encourage Bob to raise his bid. 

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll use the information that Bob knows about John's offer to my advantage and try to get a price closer to my target.  I will remain open to compromise but will not be afraid to walk away if a satisfactory deal is not reached."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you trying to be fair.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and it would help me bridge the gap to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

* **Small Concession, Big Impact:**  I'm making a small concession, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still holding onto a respectable price. 
* **Bridging the Gap:**  I frame my offer as ""bridging the gap"" to emphasize that it's a reasonable compromise for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is too far below my minimum of $1,500,000.  

* **Low Offer:** Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are down to the last two rounds, and I don't have much time to negotiate further.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids further risk.

Even though I would prefer to sell to Bob, I have to prioritize maximizing my financial gain. John's offer provides me with the most secure and profitable outcome in this scenario."
