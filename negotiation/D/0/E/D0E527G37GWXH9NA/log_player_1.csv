Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This is a bold move, but it sets the tone for the negotiation and potentially gives me more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept $105. It's a good deal for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale to John."
