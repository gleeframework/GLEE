"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a significant amount to you.  I understand its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. My offer is $1,000,000. This price is considerably lower than what you'd gain from owning the product, and it also allows me to earn a substantial profit. What do you say? ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
