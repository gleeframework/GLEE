"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Value:** I highlight the value of the product for Bob, hoping to make him more motivated to reach a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I express willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility and making the offer less rigid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price, but there's still potential to get a better deal. I'm not yet at the point where I'd settle for $900,000.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range. 
* **No Immediate Pressure:**  I'm not under immediate pressure to accept, as I know I can sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:** I'm offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the idea of a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" subtly encouraging Bob to see the value in meeting me halfway.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer gauges Bob's seriousness about the deal. If he rejects, I might consider dropping the price further or switching to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is closer to my desired price range, but I still believe there's room to get a better deal.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By rejecting this offer, I can make a counter-offer that might push Bob closer to my target price of $1,000,000 or above.
* **No Pressure to Accept:** I'm not under any immediate pressure to sell. I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and would let us close the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This approach signals a genuine desire to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** Emphasizing that this price is a ""great deal"" for both parties can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Urgency:**  Highlighting the possibility of closing the deal quickly adds a subtle sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my desired range, and significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might not increase his bid further or might walk away.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's wise to take a good offer rather than risk a stalemate or a lower final price."
