"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $8,250? This is a fair compromise, and it's a price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
