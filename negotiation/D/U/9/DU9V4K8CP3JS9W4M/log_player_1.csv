Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** I want to avoid selling to John right away, as I might get a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob if I counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** I'm still hoping to secure a better price from Bob than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if I can achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $8,250? This is a fair compromise, and it's a price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500). 
* **Approaching Minimum:**  This price is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, making it more appealing to me.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and ""benefit"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the price, but I'm hopeful that this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
