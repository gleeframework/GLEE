Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while staying above your minimum ($120). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal and a small ""loss"" on your end, potentially enticing Bob to buy. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
