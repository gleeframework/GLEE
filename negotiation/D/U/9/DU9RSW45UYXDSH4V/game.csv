"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $8,500.  This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I need you to be serious about this negotiation. $8,250 is my absolute lowest - it's a steal for what you're getting.  Take it or leave it.",8250.0,Alice,5,
