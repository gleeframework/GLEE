"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. It makes sense to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. It's nice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $10,000 maximum budget and John's offer.  This tactic might incentivize Alice to counter with a more reasonable price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your ideal price. There's no benefit to going back and forth further, especially since you can buy it for the same price from John. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
