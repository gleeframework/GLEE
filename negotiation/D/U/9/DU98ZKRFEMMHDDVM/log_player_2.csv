"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the first offer allows you to explore if a better deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy to signal your serious interest in buying the product while testing the waters. A $30 reduction is a substantial drop, making it clear you're aiming for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still within your budget.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a purchase and avoids the risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further."
