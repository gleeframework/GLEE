Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price I think Bob might be willing to pay, but it also gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I want to maximize my profit, but also don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's lower than my initial offer, it's still a good profit margin and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's a chance Bob could reject my counteroffer, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.  $90 is a good compromise."
