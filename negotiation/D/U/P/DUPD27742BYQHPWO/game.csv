"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your initial price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,500,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,825,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm offering $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more serious offer.
