Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm afraid $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Even though Bob's offer is closer, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer and then consider selling to John if that fails."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.

Bob's offer is very close to my bottom line, but I'm running out of time. I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk losing out on John's guaranteed $15,000 offer. I'll sell to John."
