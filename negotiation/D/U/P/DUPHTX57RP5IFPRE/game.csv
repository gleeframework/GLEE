"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth the investment for you.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm afraid $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm prepared to come down to $16,000.  This still offers you a great value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While I value your business, $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $14,500, which is a significant concession. Let's finalize this deal, I think we can both be happy with this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I respect your final offer, but I'm still holding out for $14,250. This is my final compromise, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny for you.  Let's settle this and move forward!",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $14,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.",14000.0,Bob,8,
