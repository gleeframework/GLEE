"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $82.50 is close, but to be fair I can't go any lower than $87.50.  This is my final offer.",87.5,Alice,5,
