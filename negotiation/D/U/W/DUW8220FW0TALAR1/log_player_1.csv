Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $875,000?

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $875,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $875,000 is a substantial profit margin, well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. However, his concessions are getting smaller. There's a risk that pushing too hard could lead to him walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonged negotiations could cause me to miss out on other potential buyers or opportunities. The time value of money is also a factor.

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit while minimizing risk and potential delays."
