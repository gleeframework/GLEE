"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still more than your maximum value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.5 is closer to your maximum value, it's still higher. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You may be able to get Alice closer to your target price of $105."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $109.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $109.5 is closer to your maximum value, you're still within the negotiation range. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can get Alice to agree on your preferred price of $107.50.  You're not obligated to buy from Alice, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate."
