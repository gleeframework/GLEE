,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $200 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be comfortable paying $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $180. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $80, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $160. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal.  If not, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $80, which is $120. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $80, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,8,
