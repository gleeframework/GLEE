"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?  It's a steal for a product this good!",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's split the difference and see if we can close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for coming up. I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we split the difference again and settle at $145? That's my final offer.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $130?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",130.0,Bob,6,
