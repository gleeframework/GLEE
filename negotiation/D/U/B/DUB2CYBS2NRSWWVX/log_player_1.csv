I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but it allows me to potentially maximize my profits. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still fall back on John's $800,000 offer, guaranteeing a profit of at least $800,000. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing a sale to Bob with the potential for a larger profit."
