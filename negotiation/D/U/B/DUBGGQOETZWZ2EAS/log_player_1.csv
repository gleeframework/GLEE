``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a higher price, but also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for it, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $8000 to $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Given your budget constraints, I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  Would you be open to that?  "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still making a reasonable investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my desired price range and a significant improvement from his initial offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's a good compromise and I'm happy to accept."
