"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find the offer attractive and we can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm countering with a price of $90. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a good profit, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and potentially ending up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
