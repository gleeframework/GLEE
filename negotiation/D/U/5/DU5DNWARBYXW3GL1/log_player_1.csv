Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $111 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference one last time and go with $112.  It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really close to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? That's the last offer I can make.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $109 is too low, and I'm concerned that if I keep negotiating, I might end up with a price lower than John's offer. It's better to guarantee a $120 sale than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
