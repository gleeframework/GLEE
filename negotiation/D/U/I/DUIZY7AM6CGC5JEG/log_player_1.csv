Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still aiming for a profitable sale.  It also opens the communication with a friendly tone, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I need to counteroffer to maintain my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This allows me to make a fair profit while still providing you with a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $9,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit. It's also clear that Bob is motivated to buy the product, which makes it likely that we can close the deal. Selling to John for $10,000 would be the ideal scenario, but taking this offer from Bob is a good alternative and avoids further negotiation."
