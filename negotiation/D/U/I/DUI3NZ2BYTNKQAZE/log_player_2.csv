"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price of $1,200,000. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
