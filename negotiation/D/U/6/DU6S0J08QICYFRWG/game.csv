"Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. This is my best offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
