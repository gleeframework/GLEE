"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Setting the Tone:** The message is friendly but firm, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is still below Bob's perceived value of $800,000, allowing for a potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate. This high initial offer will also help gauge his willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $850,000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I want to make a deal, I believe there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Potential Loss:** Selling to Bob at this price would mean a significant loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll use the next round to try to bridge the gap and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,050,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000,  but it's closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I want to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I also want to maintain a price point that's fair to me. This counteroffer should hopefully push Bob closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We're only on round 4 out of 10, which means there's still time to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's a chance that Bob will raise his offer if I reject his current proposal.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my minimum value. My goal is to get Bob as close to $1,000,000 as possible before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to come closer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it's closer to Bob's offer and feels like a reasonable compromise. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""closing this deal"" to create a positive and collaborative atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

By offering $950,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. I believe this counteroffer has a good chance of being accepted by Bob, as it's significantly closer to his desired price point. I'm also preparing myself to consider selling to John if Bob rejects this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it's still $75,000 less.
* **Limited Time:** We're now on round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of Bob significantly increasing his offer is decreasing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and secures a profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible, the risk of continuing negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high.  Selling to John provides a surefire way to maximize my profit."
