"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've stated.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $1050000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm firm at $900000. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and your stated value for the product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $950000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $925000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a final agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
