"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. It's too low, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still above my minimum value of $150, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."
