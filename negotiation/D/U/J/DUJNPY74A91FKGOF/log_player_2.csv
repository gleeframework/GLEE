"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $120 to us. Considering its true value and the benefits it offers, I would like to propose a price of $140 for you to consider. This offer includes a limited-time discount compared to our regular pricing. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both the value of the product and your budget. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the product. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's sales pitch is compelling, the price of $140 is still above your maximum budget of $120. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $120.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
