"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that high just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $990,000 is getting very close to my ideal price, I still have room to negotiate.  My goal is to get the price as low as possible, and rejecting the offer gives me another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. $990,000 is a very tempting offer, but I'm still hoping to get it just a little lower. I'm willing to pay $995,000. This price is a fair compromise and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better price.  It's a small step down from Alice's offer, showcasing a desire to meet in the middle while still getting closer to my ideal price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $995,000. I'm willing to meet you at $998,000.
