"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9200? That's still a good price for you considering the value you'll get from the product, and it gives me a fair margin. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
