"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $8,875. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already found a better deal elsewhere. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but no higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to go with the other offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
