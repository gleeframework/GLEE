Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us, and I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. It's also well within my budget and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's work together to make this happen.
