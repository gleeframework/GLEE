"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me to earn a good profit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to you.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John, even if it means paying a bit more. This maximizes your savings."
