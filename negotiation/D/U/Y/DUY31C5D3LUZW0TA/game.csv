"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering what it's worth to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let's make this happen! ",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, as it's closer to your offer and I'm ready to buy right now. Let's close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
