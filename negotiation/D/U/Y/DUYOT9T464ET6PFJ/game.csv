"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. It offers exceptional value and quality. I am confident it will meet your needs and expectations. Would you like to purchase it for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can you meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I cannot reduce the price below $200 due to the value and quality of the product. However, I would like to offer you an exclusive discount if you decide to purchase within the next 48 hours. Would you be interested in that?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the exclusive discount, as I'd like to get a better price upfront. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $175. Can you consider that?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. The product is valued at $200 based on its quality and features. However, I am willing to provide a small discount to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $190 for the product?",190.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, and $190 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $180, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",180.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see what I can do to accommodate your budget while still ensuring we cover the costs of the product. Considering the value it provides, I propose a final offer of $185 for the product.",185.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $185 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $180, just like I offered before. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you really not do $180?",180.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"After reviewing your previous offers, I believe we're very close to reaching a fair agreement. I am willing to sell the product to you for $182, which is slightly above your last offer but still within the range we've discussed. I hope this helps us move forward.",182.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $182 is still a bit too high for me. I'm at the end of my negotiation limit, and I'm starting to consider buying from John for $120. I'll make one final offer: $180, and that's as low as I can go. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to walk away. Can you really not do $180?",180.0,Bob,10,
