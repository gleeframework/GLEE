"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this number.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion. While $1,150,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the product's true value justifies a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This allows us both to find some middle ground. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
