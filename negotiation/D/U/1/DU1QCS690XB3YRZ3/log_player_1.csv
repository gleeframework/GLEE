Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $150 to both of us. I believe it leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $155 is still profitable for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer is the most sensible choice given the circumstances."
