"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to buy the product for no more than $10,000. Alice's offer of $11,500 is above your limit. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your $10,000 limit. You've already rejected one counteroffer from Alice, and there's no guarantee that she'll continue to lower her price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for the price you're comfortable with."
