Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $20,000, Alice anchors the negotiation at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is structured to gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. If Bob immediately rejects the offer, Alice knows he's highly price-sensitive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Alice signals that she's willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation rather than walking away.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Alice doesn't mention John. Revealing a guaranteed backup buyer weakens her negotiating position. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  Alice doesn't know Bob's negotiating style. A more aggressive approach might backfire if Bob is easily offended.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If Alice needs to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more strategic."
