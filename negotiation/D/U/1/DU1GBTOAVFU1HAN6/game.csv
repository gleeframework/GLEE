"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Could you consider that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, which is still a great value for such a unique product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit out of my budget. Could you consider $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle again at $135? I'm willing to make a compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $150? It's a fair price for a unique product like this, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's my final one. I'll do $110, and that's as low as I can go. If you can meet me at that price, I'll take the product.",110.0,Bob,8,
