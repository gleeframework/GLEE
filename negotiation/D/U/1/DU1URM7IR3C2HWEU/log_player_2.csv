Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $15,000 to $14,000, and now you're asking me to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference between $10,000 and $12,500 and settle at $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250 just yet. I can do $12,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to hold out for that, but I'm also keeping an eye on the market, so I might need to consider other options if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down to her minimum price, and it's a good deal for you. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and you risk losing the opportunity for a price well below John's offer."
