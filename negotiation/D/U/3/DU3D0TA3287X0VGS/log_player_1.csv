Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth more than $120.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $150 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, given it's the maximum I'm comfortable spending. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
