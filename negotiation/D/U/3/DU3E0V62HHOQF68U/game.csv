,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, would $130 work for you?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $130 is still a little high for me. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this deal work for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is just too far off from what I need to make this work.  If you're serious about buying,  would you be willing to consider $115?  That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $105. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",105.0,Bob,6,
