"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is a fair price given your asking price and my budget. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $860000.  This is a very fair price given your last offer and the value I place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.  What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $860000. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, which is closer to my original asking price. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the negotiations so far.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $870000, which is a good compromise between our last offers.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not ready to accept $870000. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, which is a small increase from my original asking price.
