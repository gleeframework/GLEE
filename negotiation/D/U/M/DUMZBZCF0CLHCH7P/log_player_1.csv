Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that I can get at least this much from Bob, as he's a potential buyer.  If he rejects, we'll see what his counteroffer looks like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price.  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm confident I can get a higher offer from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again. I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again. I think I can get a higher price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering Bob with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if he rejects it.  I'm trying to balance the need to secure a sale with the desire to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. John's offer is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement, so it's the most logical choice."
