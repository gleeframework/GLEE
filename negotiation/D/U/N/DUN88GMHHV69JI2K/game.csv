"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value and return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the price of $1,025,000. Would you be willing to negotiate further? Perhaps we could aim for a price closer to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $975,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final offer of $980,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a reasonable balance between our interests.",980000.0,Bob,6,
