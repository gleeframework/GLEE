Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is your top offer, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go down to $120. You've done well negotiating, but John's offer is your maximum price, and there's no point in risking losing that deal."
