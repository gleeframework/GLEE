"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value.  This also leaves room for me to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. Let's split the difference and call it $10,500. I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500. This is still significantly lower than Bob's value, but it shows that I am willing to negotiate and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000, which is a small compromise on my previous offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to close the deal this round, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is my final offer. Please let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
