"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $9,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11,500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $10,750. I think you know the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $12,200. Can you meet me at that price?",12200.0,Alice,7,,
