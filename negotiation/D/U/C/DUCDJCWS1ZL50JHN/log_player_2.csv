"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $10,750. I think you know the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $12,200. Can you meet me at that price?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is not budging from the $11,000-$12,000 range.  She's rejected our attempts to meet in the middle, and now her offer is worse than before.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John. While it's not ideal to pay $15,000, it's better than getting stuck in a loop with Alice and potentially paying even more."
