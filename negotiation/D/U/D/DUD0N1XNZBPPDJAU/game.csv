,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $920,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $860,000 for the product.",860000.0,Bob,4,
