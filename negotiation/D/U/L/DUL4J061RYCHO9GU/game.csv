"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $20000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $17000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13000.  I think this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $13000 is still below my minimum price point, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $15500? This offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but I'm still struggling to reach $15500.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
