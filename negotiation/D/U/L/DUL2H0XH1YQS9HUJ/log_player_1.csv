"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $15,000.  This gives me a good starting point for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds.  I also have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob's offer is too low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise.  This allows for more potential negotiation rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 below my initial counteroffer, and it's significantly closer to my minimum than my previous asking price.  At this point, there's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a much higher price.  Accepting his offer is the best choice to maximize my profit without risking further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
