"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter-offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counter-offer slightly above Alice's value ($100) but well below my maximum and her initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating, but $115 is still above my target price. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm proposing a price directly between our last two offers. It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $112. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you to get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to inch the price up, but $112 is a reasonable compromise. It's getting close to the point where continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and it's better to secure the deal than risk it falling through."
