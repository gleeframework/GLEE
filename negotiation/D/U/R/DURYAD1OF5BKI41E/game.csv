"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm prepared to sell for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has significant value. I'm willing to move my price up some, how about $760,000?  This should represent a fair deal for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to work with you. However, $760,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to sell for $790,000. That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",790000.0,Alice,5,
