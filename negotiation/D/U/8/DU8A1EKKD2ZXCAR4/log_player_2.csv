Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating with Alice, we're getting very close to my budget and the deal isn't moving as quickly as I'd hoped.  Since I can get the product from John for $1,000,000, I'm going to go ahead and buy it from him."
