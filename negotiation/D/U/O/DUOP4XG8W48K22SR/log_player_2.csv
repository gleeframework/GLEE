# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm confident it can generate much more for you in the long run.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your limit and is unlikely to go any lower.  Taking this deal saves you the hassle of further negotiation and matches the price you can get from John."
