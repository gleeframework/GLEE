"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $12,000. It's not worth it to accept, even if it's a ""good deal"" based on Alice's perspective. I'm going to reject the offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good value for you considering your price range. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget, although closer than the initial offer.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a lower price. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is closer to my budget, but still not ideal.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems Alice is unwilling to go any lower.  Rather than continue to negotiate and risk losing the opportunity with John, I'm going to take the sure thing and buy from John for $12,000."
