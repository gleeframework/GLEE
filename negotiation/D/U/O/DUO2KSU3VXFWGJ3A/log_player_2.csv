"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal from Alice, and he has a safety net in John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's still hoping to get a better deal closer to his target price of $10,500.  While $10,800 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still stuck at $10,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has come down to $10,700, which is only $200 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his fallback option is to buy from John for $12,000. It's unlikely he'll get a better deal from Alice, and there's a risk that she'll walk away if he rejects the offer."
