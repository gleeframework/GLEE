"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's make this simple - $1,450,000, and we have a deal. This product has the potential to be incredibly profitable for you, and I want to see us both come out on top.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
