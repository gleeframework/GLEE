"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal at $75, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to earn a good amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I initially wanted to earn more, Bob's offer meets my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  I'd rather secure a sale than continue negotiating and potentially miss out."
