"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  This price is significantly higher than my minimum value but gives Bob some wiggle room to bargain.  Let's see what he offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,500 is still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is another compromise, but I'm still confident that Bob will see this as a fair price. I'm hoping he'll accept the offer this time.  If he doesn't, I'll start to think more seriously about selling to John."
