"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I do see the value in this product.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but we're still a bit too far apart for my liking.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects both its value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
