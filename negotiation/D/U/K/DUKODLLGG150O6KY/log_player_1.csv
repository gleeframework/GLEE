Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while ensuring I still make a profit. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he counteroffers, I'll consider his offer and either accept it (if it's close to my minimum) or counter with a price closer to $100. If he rejects or makes a very low counteroffer, I might choose to move on to John and sell the product to him for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($120).** While $90 is a decent profit, I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:** Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but there's a chance I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, perhaps $95. I'll try to strike a balance between being firm about my minimum price and being flexible enough to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation going.
* **Focus on fairness:** I frame the price as ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary.  If he rejects my counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).** While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.
* **I'm not desperate for a sale.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe I can still convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price by counteroffering again.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, perhaps $92. I'll try to strike a balance between being firm about my minimum price and being flexible enough to close the deal.  If he rejects my offer again, I will move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired amounts. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** My counteroffer of $92 is a slight concession, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I again use the term ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to see the value in my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will immediately move on to John and sell the product to him for $120.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  I've already made multiple concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **I'm not desperate for a sale.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  I believe further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately move on to John and sell the product to him for $120.  I've maximized my potential profit with Bob, and it's time to secure a deal with a guaranteed buyer."
