Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give me some profit, but low enough to be enticing to Bob, as it's still below his valuation. I'm hoping to start a negotiation that will lead to a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation.  My goal is to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price so much.  It's time to secure the guaranteed value from John."
