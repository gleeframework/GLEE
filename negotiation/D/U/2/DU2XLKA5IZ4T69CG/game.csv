"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for you. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go.  I'm willing to compromise, though, and meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a successful transaction.  Let's finalize this deal, shall we?",950000.0,Alice,5,
