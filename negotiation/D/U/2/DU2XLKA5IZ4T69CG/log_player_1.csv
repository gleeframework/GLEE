"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, but not too high to scare Bob off right away.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, hoping to get a good deal without risking a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer. I can pay $1,000,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leave room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I have more rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to $1 million, but I'll need to be prepared to potentially sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me to let this product go.  I'm willing to compromise, though, and meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a successful transaction.  Let's finalize this deal, shall we?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough spot. While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time and Bob isn't budging much.  John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is better than risking another round of negotiation and possibly ending up with nothing.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
