"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,800,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, so I'm proposing $2,100,000. This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial deal.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $2,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any higher.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
