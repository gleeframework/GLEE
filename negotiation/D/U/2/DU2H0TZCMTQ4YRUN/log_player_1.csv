"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the conversation at $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, we establish a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this initial high number. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness and provides insight into his potential price range.

We have John as a backup plan, so we can afford to be a bit bolder in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our minimum acceptable price. We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more. We'll use the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a significant concession by dropping $200,000 from our initial offer. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Justification:** We're not just lowering the price arbitrarily. We're highlighting the unique value of the product to justify the higher cost.
* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It's still above our minimum but acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and moves the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,600,000, which is a significant increase from his initial offer and a good margin above our minimum price of $1,500,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:** He's already made several offers, and further negotiation could make him feel like we're not serious about reaching a deal.
* **Time is valuable:** We have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly better outcome. 

Accepting the $1,600,000 offer is a good balance between maximizing our profit and ensuring a successful sale."
