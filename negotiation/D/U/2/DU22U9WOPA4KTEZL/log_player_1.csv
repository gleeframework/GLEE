Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, while still aiming for a profit.  I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $8,500.  This is still a fair profit for me, but it's also more appealing to Bob than my initial offer.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although $7,800 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  Considering John is willing to buy the product for my minimum value, I'm going to choose to sell to John to guarantee a satisfactory outcome.  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further."
