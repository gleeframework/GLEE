"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John. Alice's offer is higher than that, so it's not a good deal for you. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
