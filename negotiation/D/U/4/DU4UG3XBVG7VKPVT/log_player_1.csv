Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me in the middle?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price."
