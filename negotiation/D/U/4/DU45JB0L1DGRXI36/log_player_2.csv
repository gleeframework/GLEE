"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a significant value for your investment, and I get a sale closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further, or you can always fall back on buying from John and saving $250,000."
