"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1350000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1250000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
