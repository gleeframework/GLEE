**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,250,000 and showing no signs of moving higher.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price that's significantly more beneficial than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer is the most logical choice at this point to maximize profit."
