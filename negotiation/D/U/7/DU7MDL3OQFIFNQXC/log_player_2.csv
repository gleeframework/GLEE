Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.

Alice's offer is still a bit high.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price before going with John."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum budget. At this point, it's worth going with John and getting the product for my target price."
