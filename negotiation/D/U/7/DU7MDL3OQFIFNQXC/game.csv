"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $1400000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm afraid $1400000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1550000.  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1550000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1580000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
