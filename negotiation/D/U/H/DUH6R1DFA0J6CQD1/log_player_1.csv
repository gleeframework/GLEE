Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a price significantly higher than our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive haggling.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
