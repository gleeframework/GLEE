"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation room while still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm also mindful that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a loss at this stage. I will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a considerable decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm getting closer, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,250,000. This is a significant move towards Bob's price point, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, and it might entice him to counter with something closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close, but Bob is still below my minimum.  I've reached the point where the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. I'm  going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum acceptable price."
