"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you're looking for, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a significant amount for me. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $13,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's reach a deal in this round.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final concession. If we can agree on $13,000, I'm confident we can close the deal today.",13000.0,Alice,7,
