Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) allows you to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling at a price still significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000). 
* **Secure a Sale:** While aiming high, it's important to offer a price that's palatable to Bob. A price too close to $15,000 might deter him, pushing him towards a rejection.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential reward of a higher sale price."
