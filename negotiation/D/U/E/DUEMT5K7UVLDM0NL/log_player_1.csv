Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup buyer at $100, ensuring I don't make a loss."
