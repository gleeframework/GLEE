{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth $10,000 to me, and I believe it holds similar value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $9,500 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's try $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I could get from John.  I'm going to accept his offer to close the deal."
