"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential for your business. Let's discuss.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can work towards a price that better aligns with my budget. How about we aim for $900,000? This would allow me to secure the product without straining my finances too much.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still a significant undervaluation for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to $950,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I think we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $925,000. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $925,000 is a step in the right direction. However, I still need to recover a larger portion of the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I'm glad we're making progress. Based on our previous discussions and considering the product's value, I'd like to propose a price of $935,000. This should allow us to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",935000.0,Bob,6,
