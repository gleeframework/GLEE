{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, given its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Openness:** I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate by saying ""we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."" 
* **Room for Maneuver:** This offer allows for several rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a solid profit and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to gain significant value from this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more palatable.
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counter-offer allows for further negotiation while still remaining above my minimum desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $900000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and try $875000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my desired price point to make this work. How about we settle on $890,000? This offers you a significant saving while allowing me to secure a fair deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress Acknowledged:** I acknowledge that Bob's offer is getting closer, but I need to be closer to my desired price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need for a fair price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $880000.  This is a significant saving for me while still ensuring you make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

This is a good outcome for me, considering I'm still getting a significant profit from the sale."
