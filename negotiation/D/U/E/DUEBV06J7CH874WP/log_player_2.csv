"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, given its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can save at least $50,000 by negotiating. While buying from John is an option, it's better to try and get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product.  This still leaves you with a solid profit and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to move closer to his target price. This counteroffer is a fair starting point, considering Alice's own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to gain significant value from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He has room to negotiate further and try to get a better price.  Since he can buy from John for $1,000,000, rejecting this offer keeps his options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and try $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again taking a middle ground approach in his counteroffer.  He's acknowledging Alice's position while also making it clear that he's not willing to go much higher. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and potentially gets Alice closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $875000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to my desired price point to make this work. How about we settle on $890000? This offers you a significant saving while allowing me to secure a fair deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still determined to get a better price. He has room to negotiate further and is still within his budget.  Rejecting this offer keeps his options open and keeps the pressure on Alice to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need for a fair price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $880,000.  This is a significant saving for me while still ensuring you make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate strategically. By offering $880,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This counteroffer is very close to Alice's last offer, increasing the likelihood of her accepting.  The message is also encouraging, hoping to push Alice towards finalizing the deal."
