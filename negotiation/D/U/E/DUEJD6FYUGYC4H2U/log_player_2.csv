As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,350,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both be happy with. What do you think?

Alice has met my best alternative price. There's no benefit to haggling further or going with John."
