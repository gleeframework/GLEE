"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still a good value for you considering your cost, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $860,000?  This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while staying within my budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,
