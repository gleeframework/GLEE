"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,250,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,175,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,075,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $1,075,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This price is a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
