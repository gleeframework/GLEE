"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm sure you'll agree that $900,000 is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to him, hoping to create a sense of urgency and willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for a complete win in the first round, allowing space for Bob to counteroffer and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While it's a move in the right direction, I'm not willing to accept it yet.
* **I have room to negotiate.**  I have 8 rounds left, and there's still potential for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a viable option:**  If the negotiation continues to stall, I can always secure the $1,000,000 from John. 

**Next Round:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Given the product's unique value to you, I believe $875,000 is a fair compromise.  This would be a great deal for both of us! Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes a deal seem more achievable.
* **Highlighting the value:** I continue to remind Bob of the product's value to him.  This subtle pressure could incentivize him to move closer to my price.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need for a decision (""let's see if we can make this work"").  This implies that I'm not willing to negotiate for too much longer, and could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling for that amount.
* **We are still in the early stages of the negotiation.**  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Selling to John remains a good backup option.**  If the negotiation fails to produce a better outcome, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Round:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for your investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down in price but still maintaining a significant profit for myself.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the ""great value"" the product offers for Bob's investment to further encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I reiterate the need to ""make this deal happen,"" subtly pressuring Bob to accept the offer.

I'm moving closer to Bob's desired price but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable amount.  The next few rounds will be crucial to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal increases with each round.
* **John remains a strong option:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good return, and it's a more secure option compared to continuing with Bob.

**Next Round:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, but with a slightly more aggressive approach. I need to make sure we reach a compromise soon or I will need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I'm still not sure we're close to a deal. Given the product's value to you, I believe $840,000 is a fair final offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my last compromise. If you're serious about this product, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  I'm dropping the price slightly, but I'm also emphasizing this as my ""last compromise."" This creates a sense of urgency and finality, encouraging Bob to reconsider.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, implying that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Creating a Deadline:** I'm setting a clear expectation that this is the final offer, making it more likely that Bob will either accept or move closer to my price.

With only 3 rounds left, I need to start pushing for a decision.  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but $840,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $820,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 8, and with only 2 rounds left, the probability of Bob coming up to my desired price is slim.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $820,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

While I'd love to have a deal with Bob, I can't risk losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a much lower price.  John provides a more secure and profitable option at this point."
