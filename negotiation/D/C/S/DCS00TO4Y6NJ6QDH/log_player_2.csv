# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to us both.

This price reflects a fair valuation while allowing us to share the benefits of this exceptional item. I believe this offer presents a unique chance for us to collaborate and achieve mutual satisfaction. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly overselling the value of the product to you. While she claims it's worth $1,200,000 to you, you know your own valuation is lower.  Her offer of $1,150,000 is still too high. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or move on to John, who's offering the product for $50,000 less."
