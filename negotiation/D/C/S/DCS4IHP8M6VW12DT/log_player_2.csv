"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
This is a no-brainer. $140 is way above your budget and Alice's valuation.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do it for $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counteroffer of $80 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but clear that the initial price is not acceptable.

This strategy allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for a potential bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I think my product is worth more than $80. I can do $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $110 is still a bit above our $100 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. We can likely get the price closer to our range. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  We know we can get the product for $100 from John, which gives us a strong position to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a price exactly halfway between our last offer ($80) and Alice's current offer ($110). This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help close the deal.
* **Approaching Our Limit:**  While we're still aiming for a lower price,  $95 is getting close to our $100 maximum. We need to be prepared to potentially accept if Alice agrees. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We want to keep the negotiation friendly and positive to increase the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $95. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice is firm at $105, which is above our $100 budget. 
* **No More Room to Negotiate:**  Alice has explicitly stated this is her lowest price.
* **John's Offer is Better:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It makes no sense to pay more with Alice. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the guaranteed deal with John."
