Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal, especially since the product is worth $8,000 to him. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm still not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $11,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a compromise to show I'm willing to negotiate. I hope Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to drop my price that far. It's time to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
