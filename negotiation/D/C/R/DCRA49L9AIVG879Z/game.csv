"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me. This product has great potential, but I need a more competitive price.  How about we bring it down a bit?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 was a bit steep, but I have to consider my investment in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to make sense for my budget. Would you consider $825,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already invested a significant amount in this product, and $825,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final concession, and I respect that.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer you $860,000. This is really the best I can do. If you can't accept it, I understand, but I'm hoping we can close this deal today.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad we're having an open conversation. However, $860,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find common ground. I can offer you the product for $920,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that final offer is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  I'm hoping we can make this work!",880000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my investment. I can offer you the product for $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my last chance to make a deal, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",900000.0,Alice,9,
