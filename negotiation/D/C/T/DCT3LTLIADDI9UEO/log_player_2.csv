I'm starting with a significantly lower price to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This gives us room to find a mutually agreeable price."

While $850,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $750,000."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $800,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer."
