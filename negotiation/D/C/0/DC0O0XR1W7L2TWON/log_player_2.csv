"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500, which is still a fair price considering your value of $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $8,500 is significantly lower than $12,000.
* **No strong reason to keep negotiating:** While Bob could try to get the price down further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price is too high. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Continued negotiation takes time and might lead to missing other opportunities. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice for Bob."
