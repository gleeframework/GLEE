Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $150 and  leaves me with a very small profit.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep the cost below $100. Would $95 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $95 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $97.50 is getting close to my minimum, I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher. At this point, selling to John for $150 guarantees me a much better profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
