"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While the product looks great, $120 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a compromise at $125.",125.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm happy to pay $115 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $115, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $120. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",120.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I can only afford $110 right now.  This would still allow you a decent margin, and it's the best I can do.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can offer you a slight compromise at $118. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",118.0,Alice,7,,
