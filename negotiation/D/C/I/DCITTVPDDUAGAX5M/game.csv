"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?  That would be a fair compromise I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. How about we try $10,500? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make this concession to keep the negotiation going.",10500.0,Alice,5,
