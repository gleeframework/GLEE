{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer leaves space for negotiation without going below my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).  
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value Bob will receive. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my $10,000 value as possible, but I also want to keep Bob engaged. By starting high and being willing to negotiate, I increase my chances of striking a deal that benefits both of us.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.  If negotiations stall, I have the safety net of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit limited on my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to take the deal to avoid losing the sale entirely, accepting his offer would leave me with a significant financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground.  If negotiations continue to stall, I'll sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Maintaining my Value:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still safeguarding my financial interests. I'm confident that $9,000 is a fair compromise that could be acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make a final counteroffer, but I'm ready to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown a slight increase in his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial financial loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll make one final counteroffer, aiming to meet in the middle.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John, ensuring I don't lose money. I'm running out of negotiating room, so I'll need to make a firm decision in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  This is my final offer: $9,250. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to find a solution. If you're not able to meet me at this price, I'll unfortunately have to sell to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing this as my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $9,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's last offer ($8,750). 
* **Decision Point:**  I'm clearly stating the consequences of rejection, making it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This is my last chance to reach a compromise with Bob. I've lowered my price significantly, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John and secure my desired profit."
