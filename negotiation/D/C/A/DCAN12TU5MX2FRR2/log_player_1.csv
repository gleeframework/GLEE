"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away.  I'm hoping this will give me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $19,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement and I want to see if I can get a bit closer to $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $18,500. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get as much as possible.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17800}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,800.  I'm now very close to Bob's offer, but still trying to squeeze out a little more. I'm hoping the small difference will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting dangerously close to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left.  I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17200}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,200. This is a significant jump from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise.  I'm getting low on rounds and need to get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While I would love to get more than $15,000, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher. With only one round left and the risk of not getting any deal at all, I'm going to sell to John. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the most secure way to get a decent profit."
