"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1500000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1800000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still below my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1850000. This would allow both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1800000 still falls short of the product's worth. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1825000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair price considering the value of the product.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
