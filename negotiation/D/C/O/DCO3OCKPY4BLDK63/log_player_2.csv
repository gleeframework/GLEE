# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let's start the negotiation with a strong offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high.  There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer keeps the process moving towards a more favorable outcome for you."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a strong price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,325,000, which is within your budget and represents a good deal considering your initial goal of saving as much money as possible.  While you could potentially continue negotiating and try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or the deal falling through is increasing. It's a good time to accept and secure the product."
