"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Buying from John immediately would be worse than negotiating with Alice, even if you don't get the best price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, and you're willing to pay up to $10,000.  A counteroffer of $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, splitting the difference.
* **Negotiation:**  This offer shows Alice that you're serious about buying, but are also looking for a good deal. It gives her room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:** Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is closer to her original price than your counteroffer. This suggests she's not willing to budge too much.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** You still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John for $10,000 is still a worse option than potentially getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. 
* **Midpoint:**  It's also closer to Alice's latest offer, showing that you are willing to meet halfway.
* **Remaining Room:** This offer still leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling forced to accept a price significantly below her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice's offer keeps creeping up, showing she's not very flexible. 
* **John's Price:** Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There are still 5 rounds left, giving you time to potentially get a better deal.

**Strategy:** Continue to negotiate with Alice to see if you can reach a price lower than $9,400. You're still in a better position than buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below her price. It signals a final push to try to reach an agreement before you consider John's offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's important to make a move that shows you're serious about buying but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Risk Assessment:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll need to carefully weigh the risks of accepting her next offer or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice's offer is getting increasingly close to your maximum price point. 
* **Limited Time:**  You only have 3 rounds remaining, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge much.
* **Better Alternative:**  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you get the product. While it's not the ideal price, it's a safer option given the limited time and Alice's stubbornness.

You've tried to negotiate a lower price, but at this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential benefit. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the chance of a last-minute stalemate with Alice."
