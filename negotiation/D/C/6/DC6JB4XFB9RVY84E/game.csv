"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,150,000 remains beyond my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
