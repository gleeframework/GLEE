Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this represents a fair offer considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. Therefore, she starts high, aiming to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible.
* **Room for negotiation:** The message hints at potential flexibility (""open to discussing"") without committing to a lower price immediately. This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above John's offer. 
* **Value justification:** Alice emphasizes the product's benefits (""highly valuable"", ""unique features"") to justify the high price, even though she knows Bob values it less.

This strategy maximizes Alice's chances of:

* **Scenario 1: Bob accepts:** Alice gets a higher price than John's offer.
* **Scenario 2: Bob negotiates down:** Alice has room to maneuver and potentially still get a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Scenario 3: Bob rejects:** Alice can move on to John, knowing she tried to get the best possible deal."
