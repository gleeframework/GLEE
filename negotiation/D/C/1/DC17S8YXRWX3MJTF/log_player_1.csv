Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000 for this product.  That's a fair price given its value to me.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1250000.  This would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it's still a fair price for you considering its value to you.  Let's try to bridge the gap.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for a price that is below my minimum acceptable offer."
