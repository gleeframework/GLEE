"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That would be fair to both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $78.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $78 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $80 - that would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I could finalize the sale right now.",80.0,Alice,5,
