Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize profit.  I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation. I also want to see if he's seriously interested in buying at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less, but I can try to negotiate a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from him.  It's not worth risking losing the deal for such a small difference. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell him the product."
