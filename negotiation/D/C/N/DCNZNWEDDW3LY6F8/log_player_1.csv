Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
