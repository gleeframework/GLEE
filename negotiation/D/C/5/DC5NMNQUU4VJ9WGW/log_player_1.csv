"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm aiming for a price around $2,300,000 for it. What are your initial thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By setting a high anchor, I influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading him to counteroffer within a range more favorable to me. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims for a collaborative tone rather than a confrontational one, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy seeks to maximize potential profit while leaving me the option to adjust my approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has value, $2,300,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, I still see potential to negotiate a better deal with Bob over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise to move the negotiation forward. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price by $400,000, signaling flexibility, but I remain well above both my minimum and Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation alive while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I aim to reframe Bob's perception and justify the higher price point. 
* **Encouraging Engagement:** The message ends with an open question, prompting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  To be frank, I'm considering my other options closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere near there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) but is still significantly below my minimum. I suspect he has room to move, especially since he mentioned ""considering other options"" implying he sees value in my product.  I'll continue negotiating strategically to see if I can secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $950,000 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a significant gap from my perspective. To be completely transparent, I have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $300,000, a smaller jump than before, indicating I'm approaching my limit.
* **Transparency and Alternatives:**  By mentioning ""other interested buyers"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency and competition without explicitly threatening to walk away.
* **Final Push:** This offer represents a strong but potentially acceptable compromise. It allows for one or two more rounds of smaller adjustments if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand you have other potential buyers, but so do I. I can go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point. Bob has moved significantly and presented his ""absolute limit,"" which is a good sign he's serious. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. While selling to John is tempting, I believe there's a small window to push Bob slightly further in the next round or two.  I'll reject, but I need to be prepared to either accept a price very close to his last offer or walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a great potential buyer and I respect that you're sticking to your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to consider my bottom line. Given everything we've discussed,  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with other buyers. "", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm splitting the difference between his last offer ($1,100,000) and my previous ask ($1,500,000). This represents a significant concession on my part, but I'm still above my absolute minimum. 
* **Walk Away Ready:**  I'm prepared to walk away if Bob rejects this. I've negotiated in good faith and the potential profit loss is becoming too great to justify further concessions."
