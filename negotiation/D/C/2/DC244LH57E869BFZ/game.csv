"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which I think is a fair starting point given its value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $7,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is worth more than $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm really limited to $8,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
