Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm really limited to $8,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
