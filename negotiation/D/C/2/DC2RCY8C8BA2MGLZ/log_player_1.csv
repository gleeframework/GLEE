Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, and this price gives you a good profit margin.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This shows you're serious about selling but are also open to negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, it's worth trying to get a bit more from Bob.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Remains above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **Explains your reasoning:** This shows Bob you're serious about a deal but can't go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $13,000. I'm willing to pay $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is only a little bit above my minimum, it's still a good profit. It's a risk to reject and counter again since there's always a chance he'll walk away.  I'll take this offer and secure the sale!"
