"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can on this purchase.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget at $13,000. I'm willing to pay $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
