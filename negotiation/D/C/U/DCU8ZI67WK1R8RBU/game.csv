"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. This product is a game-changer, and its worth is undeniable.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this reflects its value while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I hope this helps us reach a fair agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. However, $1,100,000 is still cutting it close to my bottom line. Let's settle this right now. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. While I'm impressed by your flexibility, I must stick to my budget. I'd like to propose a final price of $1,125,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
