Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum allows for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so our offer must be significantly more attractive to Bob than that.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing potential profit."
