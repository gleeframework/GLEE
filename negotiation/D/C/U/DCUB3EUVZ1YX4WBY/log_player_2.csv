"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,100,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but you want to save money.
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum, but there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Alice won't budge on her price. In that case, you can always accept her offer or buy from John for $1,200,000."
