Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While further negotiation might be possible, Bob's offers are escalating too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point acceptable to me (above $1,200,000) without significant time investment. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
