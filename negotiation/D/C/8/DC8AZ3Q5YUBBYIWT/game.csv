"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment and opportunity, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me, and it allows for a profitable deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground, but I'm serious when I say that $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still providing a significant opportunity for you.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
