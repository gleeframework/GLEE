{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to John's offer. This might entice Bob while ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to discuss the offer further."
