"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000, my maximum budget. This is a strong opening position, and it will let Alice know I'm serious about getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects this, I have options to either continue negotiating or buy from John at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,000,000 and still have the option to buy from John. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,200,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a price closer to my budget. This gives her some room to negotiate while still leaving me room to reduce the price further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not willing to go above my budget.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,300,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a good deal.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between our desired prices. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm getting closer to my fallback option with John, so I'm not as concerned about making further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm not confident that I can get Alice to go lower. I'm better off buying from John for my maximum price to avoid risking losing out on the product altogether."
