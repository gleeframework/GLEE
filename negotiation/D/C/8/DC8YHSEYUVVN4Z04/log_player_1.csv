Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first might lead to a faster sale even if it's at a slightly lower price than I might ultimately get through negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some time flexibility. If I need to sell the product immediately, offering it to Bob at $10,000 would guarantee the sale."
