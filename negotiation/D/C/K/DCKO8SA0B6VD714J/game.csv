"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $1,300,000, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,350,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,250,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
