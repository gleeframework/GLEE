Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While we could push for more, accepting $1,350,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still securing a $350,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer risks Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer.
* **John as Backup:**  While John offers $1,000,000, it's better to secure the higher offer we have on the table."
