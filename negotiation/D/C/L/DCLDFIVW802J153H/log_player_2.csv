"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than her product's value to her ($120), it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80 and the guaranteed price of $80 from John.  You can save money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
