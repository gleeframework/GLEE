"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to settle there.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9000. How about we try $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and $9500 is a reasonable offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $10000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a bit closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can we meet at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
