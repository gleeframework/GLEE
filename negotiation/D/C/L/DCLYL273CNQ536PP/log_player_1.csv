Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while still exceeding your minimum. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you don't need to go below $12,000.  However, a price slightly above Bob's perceived value might entice him.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $12,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Urgency:** The message creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""unique value"" subtly hints that the price might be negotiable.
* **Profit Margin:**  The $12,500 price gives you a $500 profit over your guaranteed sale.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes Bob is somewhat price-sensitive. If you know Bob is an aggressive negotiator, you might start higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly lower price might be more suitable.
