It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:** We're getting close to John's price of $1,200,000. Continuing to push might backfire.
* **Alice is negotiating:** Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Saving money:**  $1,075,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer.

While we could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
