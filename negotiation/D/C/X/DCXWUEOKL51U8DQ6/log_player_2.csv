"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  To be fair, the product is worth a significant amount to me as well. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects the value while hopefully finding some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a price that's hard to ignore.  However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial solution. My absolute final offer is $975,000. This takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to walk away pleased. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still above his target price of $800,000. He has already shown Alice he's willing to negotiate, and has a backup option in John. It's worth trying to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
