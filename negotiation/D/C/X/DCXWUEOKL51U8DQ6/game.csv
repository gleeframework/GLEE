"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 right now.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  To be fair, the product is worth a significant amount to me as well. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects the value while hopefully finding some common ground.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $900,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a price that's hard to ignore.  However, I believe in finding a mutually beneficial solution. My absolute final offer is $975,000. This takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to walk away pleased.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation, but $975,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,6,
