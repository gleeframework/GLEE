Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows it's worth $1,500,000 to her and she has a guaranteed buyer at that price. Therefore, she starts the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob.  This allows Alice to potentially secure a price even closer to her desired amount.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly nudge Bob towards considering a higher price than he might have initially intended. 
* **Backup Option:**  Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed buyer, giving her leverage in the negotiation. She doesn't need to desperately lowball the price."
