"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe that's a fair price given I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
