"Alice,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. It shows you're serious. While $2,000,000 represents the high-end value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant but fair discount for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and the potential I see in it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
