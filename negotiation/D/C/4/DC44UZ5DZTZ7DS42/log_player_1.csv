"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe it's a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see from this."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but reasonable):**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly above his valuation leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge his interest level. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it sets a strong anchor.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly implies the price is justified and focuses on Bob's potential gain rather than just the product itself. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is positive and suggests this is just the opening move in a negotiation (""initially proposing"").

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** We want to secure the highest price possible, exceeding John's offer.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give valuable insight into his willingness to pay and negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is already above his perceived value of the product, indicating there's room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting $1,200,000 would be settling for less than John is willing to pay. 
* **Early Stage:**  It's still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows us to gauge Bob's flexibility and potentially secure a better deal. 

**Strategy for Next Round:**

In the next round, we'll make a counteroffer that's still above John's offer but lower than our initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. It shows you're serious. While $2,000,000 represents the high-end value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a significant but fair discount for you."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price by $250,000, which is a significant move to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  The new price is still substantially higher than John's $1,500,000 offer, preserving our goal of maximizing profit.
* **Justification:** We're framing the lower price as a ""significant but fair discount"" rather than a desperate reduction. This reinforces the product's value. 

**Goal:** We want to see if Bob is willing to move significantly closer to our price range. If he counters with a small increase from his previous offer, we may consider accepting John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and the potential I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now greater than John's standing offer of $1,500,000.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a serious intent to purchase. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting now secures a significant profit. 

**Conclusion:**

It's best to accept Bob's offer of $1,400,000. This represents a successful negotiation where we've secured a price significantly higher than Bob's initial willingness to pay and above our guaranteed offer from John."
