``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him some room to negotiate. However, it's also significantly below my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for me to potentially increase the price during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can potentially get a better price by counteroffering. I'll proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired amount. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. I'll proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
