"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. If you reject the offer, you can make another counteroffer closer to your budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This compromise acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,200,000.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate with Alice will be a long and arduous process, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to get her to come down further.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for your maximum price, it's more efficient and less risky to simply buy from John."
