"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,000,000 to you. However, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum value of $1,000,000. You can get the product from John for a lower price, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
