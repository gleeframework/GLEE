Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is more than his stated value for the product, it's still significantly less than what I consider fair. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,500.  Let's split the difference at $12,150. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12150}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, he's not getting close enough to my desired price.  I've already gone through several rounds and don't want to risk losing any more time and potentially getting a worse deal.  John's offer is the best option right now, ensuring I get the full value for the product."
