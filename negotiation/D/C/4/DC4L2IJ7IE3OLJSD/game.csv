"Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This price still allows for a healthy profit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet. I'm happy to offer you $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward with this deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but I need to be honest, I've got another buyer, John, who's interested in the product at a higher price. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I might need to explore that option.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this deal happen.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have another offer, but I'm still interested in your product. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to go with John's offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll be moving forward with John's offer.  Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
