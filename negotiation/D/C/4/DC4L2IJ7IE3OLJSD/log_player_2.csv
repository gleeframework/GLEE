"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,200,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This price still allows for a healthy profit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm not willing to go above my budget of $1,000,000. I'll reject the offer and see if we can get closer to my price range.  I'm also keeping in mind the option of buying from John, which is always available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet. I'm happy to offer you $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward with this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but I need to be honest, I've got another buyer, John, who's interested in the product at a higher price. If we can't reach an agreement soon, I might need to explore that option.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,450,000 is still too high. I'm not comfortable going above my $1,000,000 limit.  Since I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, I'll continue to negotiate with Alice but am ready to walk away if she doesn't come down further.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have another offer, but I'm still interested in your product. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll be moving forward with John's offer.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  While we're getting closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is a much better deal for me.  I'll take the safe route and buy from John."
