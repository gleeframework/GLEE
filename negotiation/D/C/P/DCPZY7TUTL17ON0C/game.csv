"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's true value to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering your valuation and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that makes us both happy.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",875000.0,Alice,5,
