"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would still allow you to make a decent profit, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,150,000.  Would you be open to $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,187,500. This is a fair compromise and would allow you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
