{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, as the product is worth the same to him."

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still aim for a profit.  $850,000 is a good compromise, and I believe it's still within Bob's range of willingness to pay."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of time.  To ensure I get a decent price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  This is a good outcome considering Bob's unwillingness to meet my expectations."
