Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and recognize the product's potential, I'm looking to make a more significant investment. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $700,000. This would give us both a solid profit margin and allows me to move forward confidently. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.
