"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to her value of $10,000.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** We're aiming to buy as low as possible, so starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite & Interested:**  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away. We express continued interest in the product to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have some bargaining power.  While $10,500 is closer to her value, it's still above the midpoint between our initial offer and her starting price. We'll try to inch closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Slowly:**  We're increasing our offer, but in smaller increments to show we're negotiating seriously while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Finding the Middle Ground:** This offer is slightly above the midpoint between our last offer ($9,000) and her current price ($10,500), showing movement towards a compromise. 
* **Positive Language:**  Continuing to be polite and respectful increases the chances of Alice accepting our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $10,250 is a good price considering her product value is $10,000. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We've used half of our rounds, and continuing to haggle over small amounts might make Alice less willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try for a slightly lower price, there's a chance Alice could become firmer in her position, and we'd risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $12,000. 

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk getting a worse outcome later."
