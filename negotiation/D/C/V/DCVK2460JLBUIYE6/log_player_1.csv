Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,350,000 is not feasible for me. I can do $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter to guide the price closer to a mutually acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to consider $1,125,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and bridges the gap between our valuations."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, and it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It seems unlikely he'll substantially increase his offer in future rounds.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation risk."
