While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely negotiate a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is only $20,000 more than what John is selling it for.  It's not a huge difference, and it's likely you won't get Alice to go lower.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
