"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this asset.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
