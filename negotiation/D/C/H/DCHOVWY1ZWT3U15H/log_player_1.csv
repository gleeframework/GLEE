"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $80 is too low for me. I'm going to try and get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget, but I can't go any lower than $95. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get. I'm open to discussing this further if you'd like."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $92 is the highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful not to let the negotiation drag on too long and risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  I'll see if I can get him to budge just a bit more in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but I'm still firm at $93.  It's a fair price for the value you'll get. Let's see if we can close this deal on this round."", ""product_price"": 93}
