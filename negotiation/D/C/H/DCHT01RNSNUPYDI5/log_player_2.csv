"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's actually more than double my budget! I need to negotiate this down significantly.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum selling price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's intrinsic value while still offering you a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than my budget. I'll hold firm and send another counteroffer in the next round.  I need to guide her closer to a price I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I can go a bit higher, but $1,200,000 is just not feasible for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm serious about finding a price that works for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be candid, $700,000 is still below what I can accept, and I wouldn't be maximizing the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This allows me to achieve a fairer price while still giving you a great deal on a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still too high. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to signal to Alice that I'm willing to walk away if we can't find a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to be mindful of my budget, and I'm prepared to explore other options if we can't make a deal at this price."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
