"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I clearly state my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while leaving room to move closer to Bob's valuation if necessary. I can always adjust my offer downwards in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I will reject his offer and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum selling price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's intrinsic value while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm holding firm at my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This conveys the seriousness of my valuation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential return on investment for Bob, emphasizing why this price is justified.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** While holding firm, I'm framing this as an attempt to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

I'm willing to risk Bob walking away at this stage, as selling to John is still a guaranteed option. This strategy prioritizes maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I can go a bit higher, but $1,200,000 is just not feasible for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm serious about finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. I believe there's still some room for negotiation, and I'm hoping that by firmly holding my position, I can encourage Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be candid, $700,000 is still below what I can accept, and I wouldn't be maximizing the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This allows me to achieve a fairer price while still giving you a great deal on a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Holding Strong:** I'm acknowledging Bob's movement on price but holding firm above the midpoint between our last offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **""Fairer Price"" Language:** This implies my previous offers were already fair, making this concession seem more significant.
* **Focus on ""Great Deal"":**  Shifting emphasis from just the price to the value Bob gets reinforces the idea this is a good opportunity for him, even at a higher price point.

I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be preferable if Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer. This round aims to either close the deal quickly or give me a clear signal of Bob's upper limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to be mindful of my budget, and I'm prepared to explore other options if we can't make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $750,000 is his absolute limit. This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

While there are rounds left, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant shift in Bob's position. It's clear that our valuations are too far apart. 

Therefore, the best course of action is to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum acceptable outcome without risking further time and effort with Bob."
