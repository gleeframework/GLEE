"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic with my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum selling price. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's intrinsic value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but we're still quite far apart on price.  I can go a bit higher, but $1,200,000 is just not feasible for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm serious about finding a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be candid, $700,000 is still below what I can accept, and I wouldn't be maximizing the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This allows me to achieve a fairer price while still giving you a great deal on a valuable asset.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to be mindful of my budget, and I'm prepared to explore other options if we can't make a deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
