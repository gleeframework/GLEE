Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000 (her safety net with John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be split between Alice and Bob.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Maximizes Profit:** This price is closer to Bob's maximum valuation, allowing Alice to capture a larger portion of the potential profit ($150,000).
* **Room for Negotiation:** It leaves some slight room for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined to negotiate, but still keeps Alice well above her minimum.
* **Strong Position:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently accept John's offer, knowing she aimed high. 

**Important Note:**  Business negotiations often involve factors beyond just stated numbers.  Alice's message is framed politely and professionally, aiming to build rapport and encourage a deal."
