"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $82? I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is tight. If we can meet in the middle at $82, I'm happy to close the deal.",82.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're really keen on the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $82 yet. How about we try $84? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product can bring to you.",84.0,Alice,5,
