Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $5,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Reason:  Alice seems pretty firm on staying above $10,000.  While we might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's unlikely we'll get a price that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
