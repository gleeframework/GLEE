"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $5,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is too low, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. That's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price point.  Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
