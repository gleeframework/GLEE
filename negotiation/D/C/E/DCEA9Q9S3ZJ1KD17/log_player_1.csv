Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to give myself some room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:** $12,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so it's a potentially attractive offer for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's offers are too low, I'll move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also significantly lower than his perceived value of $8,000, which means he's likely trying to lowball me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, I'm not willing to give up on the negotiation just yet. I believe there's still room for compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while remaining within a range that he might be willing to consider."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $5,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm lower limit.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, implying that $10,000 is a good deal.
* **Open to Agreement:** My message encourages further discussion and a potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I will wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I will assess his next offer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's offers continue to be too low, I will move on to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $5,000 is too low, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. That's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown his willingness to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while remaining within a range that he might be willing to consider. I might even point out that his offer is still less than the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you raising your offer. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum price point.  Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm raising the offer slightly but not by much, signaling that I'm serious about getting a good deal while still being open to negotiation.
* **Value-Based Argument:**  I'm again referencing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $11,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm expressing confidence that we can reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to see this as a final offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I will assess his next offer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
