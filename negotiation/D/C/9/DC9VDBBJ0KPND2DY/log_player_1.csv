{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a price higher than your minimum:**  $850,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:**  Mentioning the value to Bob strengthens the justification for the price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The message makes it clear you are open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still higher than what you'd get from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $750,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price ensures both of us benefit from the transaction.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  We're offering $800,000 which is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Benefit:**  We highlight the benefit to both parties of the transaction.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's make this happen!"" emphasizes the value of a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $780000? I'm really interested in this product and would like to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:**  While not ideal, $780,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Future Negotiations:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and you'll be left with only John's $800,000 offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting the offer now allows you to close the deal and move on to other opportunities. 

It's a calculated risk to accept, but in this situation, it's the best course of action to maximize your potential earnings while minimizing risk."
