"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $13,750. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,750? This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $13,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession, so I'll offer $13,250. I hope this is a more reasonable compromise for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,6,
