I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000. It's risky, but I'm hoping he'll come around."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push him higher. There's still a chance he'll accept a price closer to my goal."

I've reached a point where Bob and I are very close in price, but I'm worried about running out of time. Since John is willing to pay my desired price, it's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing.  I'll sell to John for $1,200,000."
