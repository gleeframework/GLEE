"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original price. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal happen.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay closer to $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,200?  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10200.0,Alice,5,
