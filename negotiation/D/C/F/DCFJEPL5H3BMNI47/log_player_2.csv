"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save $1,000 by negotiating with Alice further. Even if the negotiation fails, he can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to split the difference with Alice's offer, offering $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum price of $12,000. It gives Alice some room to counter while still allowing Bob to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation and potential delays."
