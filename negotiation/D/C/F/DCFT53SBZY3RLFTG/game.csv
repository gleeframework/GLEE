"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1100000 is a more reasonable price. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1050000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making one last concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1090000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1090000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1090000. I've already made significant concessions, and I think it's time for me to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1000000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to him. I'm done negotiating with you, Bob. If you're not willing to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with, I'll sell the product to John.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
