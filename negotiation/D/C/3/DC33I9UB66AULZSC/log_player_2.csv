"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it reasonable. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.** $13,500 is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer, and is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice getting frustrated or walking away. It's also possible that Alice could make a counteroffer that is higher than $13,500, forcing Bob to pay more.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  While John's offer is on the table, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500. 

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this round."
