"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident in the value of the product and I want to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it immediately. I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm countering with a price of $150. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, I can convince him to come up a bit more."
