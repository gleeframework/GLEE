,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $10,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still a bit far off.  How about we split the difference at $8,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can do $9,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might miss out on a better opportunity if we don't reach an agreement soon.",9500.0,Alice,5,
