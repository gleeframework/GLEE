"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,300,000 is still a little too steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,237,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but that price is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,200,000.  If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,225,000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
