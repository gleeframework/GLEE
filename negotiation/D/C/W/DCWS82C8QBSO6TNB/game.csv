"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $77 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",82.0,Alice,5,
