"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we settle in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $77 is closer to my desired range, it's still a bit too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $77 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 82}
