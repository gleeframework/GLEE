"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I have to consider my costs and value the product at a minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm comfortable paying $12,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to get a bit more out of the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
