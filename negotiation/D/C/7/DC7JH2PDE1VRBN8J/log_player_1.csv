Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I am hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
