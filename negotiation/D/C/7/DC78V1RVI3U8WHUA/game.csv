"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
