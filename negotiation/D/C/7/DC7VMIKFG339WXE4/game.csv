"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a profit. My initial offer is $1200000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1050000 to make it worth my while. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need $1075000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $975000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good price for a product like this, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let's finalize the deal.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $980000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $965000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",965000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $975000, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $955000, Alice. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. Let's see if we can make a deal.",955000.0,Bob,10,
