# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $18,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. I could meet you halfway at $15,000, which is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
