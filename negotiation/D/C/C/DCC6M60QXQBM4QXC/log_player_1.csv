"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $950,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $950000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm hoping we can continue to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'm offering $900000, and I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm selling the product to John.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's shown some willingness to compromise, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that is acceptable to me.  John's offer gives me a price that I'm comfortable with, and it's time to move on."
