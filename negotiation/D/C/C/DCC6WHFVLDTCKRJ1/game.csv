"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $100 to you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $80? That's as low as I'm willing to go.,80.0,Bob,4,
