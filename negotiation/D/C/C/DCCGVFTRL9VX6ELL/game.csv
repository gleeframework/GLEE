"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the unique benefits it offers and its potential for return.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,100,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
