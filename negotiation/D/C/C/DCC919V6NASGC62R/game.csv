"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to purchase today.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm still making a significant profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm still making a decent profit. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
