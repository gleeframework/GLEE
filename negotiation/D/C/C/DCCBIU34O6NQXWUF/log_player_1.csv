Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm setting the price at $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your absolute minimum ($15,000) gives you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and demand,"" you create a reason for the high price, potentially persuading Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price too high. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum."
