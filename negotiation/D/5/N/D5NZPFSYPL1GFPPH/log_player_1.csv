Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $12,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still giving him a strong incentive to buy (he saves $3,000). 

This approach balances risk and reward, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price that benefits both parties."
