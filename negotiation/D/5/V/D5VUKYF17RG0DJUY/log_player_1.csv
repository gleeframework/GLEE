"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, leaving space for potential negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, even though his offer is closer to his perceived value.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects this, I'll likely have to choose John in the next round. 
* **Remaining assertive:** While lower than my initial offer, it's still a significant profit for me and likely a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be cautious about accepting offers that are too low. 
* **John's offer is a safe haven:**  If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John and ensure a substantial profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** This counteroffer is a further compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's a significant drop from my previous offer but still above Bob's latest offer.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to gauge Bob's final willingness to pay. If he rejects this, I'll likely choose John in the next round.
* **Time pressure:** With fewer rounds left, I need to find a balance between maximizing profit and not losing the deal completely. 
* **John's offer still available:**  I have a strong safety net if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the chance of getting a significantly higher offer from Bob is low.
* **Small negotiation gains:** The difference between Bob's latest offer and my desired price is shrinking with each round, and the potential gains are diminishing.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a slightly higher price is not worth the potential loss of the guaranteed $15,000 from John. 

It's better to secure the deal with John and guarantee a substantial profit."
