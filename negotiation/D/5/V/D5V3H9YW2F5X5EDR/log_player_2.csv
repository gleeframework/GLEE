"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's both attractive to him and leaves some room for negotiation.  A $11,000 offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob.  While I value your offer, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price.  However, it's closer to his maximum budget, and there's still room for further negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to compromise further, especially since she rejected his previous counteroffer.  Buying from John is still an option, but Bob wants to exhaust all possibilities with Alice before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  How about $12,000?  That's a good midpoint, and I think we can finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a reasonable counteroffer by offering $12,000. It's closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget.  Bob is showing he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. This strategy is likely to lead to a successful negotiation."
