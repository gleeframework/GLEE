"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be interested in buying the product from me for $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $110? That would be a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a good middle ground.",130.0,Alice,5,
