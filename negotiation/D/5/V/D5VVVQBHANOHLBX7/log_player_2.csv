"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you be interested in buying the product from me for $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can potentially get the price down to $100, especially since you're willing to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $110? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $130? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a good middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $130 is still above your budget. Even though you've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, it seems like you're not going to be able to get her down to your target price of $100. It's better to buy the product from John for $100, which is within your budget, rather than risk continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to get the product at a reasonable price."
