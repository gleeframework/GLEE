Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This leaves some room for negotiation but still gets me closer to my goal of maximizing profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is technically above my minimum, it's still far below what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal.  There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and I'm not giving up on getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair compromise. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob in the next few rounds, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. John's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with him in the future.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
