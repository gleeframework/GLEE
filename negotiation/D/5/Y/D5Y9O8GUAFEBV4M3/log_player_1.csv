{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a higher price is ideal, Bob has drawn a firm line and is unlikely to go higher. Accepting the $1,150,000 offer is still a significant profit ($150,000) over John's offer.  Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob altogether and being forced to accept the lower offer."
