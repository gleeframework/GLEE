"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,15000.0
"I understand that $12,000 is your target, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. ",13000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going below that. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
