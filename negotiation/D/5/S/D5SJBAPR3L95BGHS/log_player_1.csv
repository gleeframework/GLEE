Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price gives you a buffer. 
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $19,000 allows for a potential $4,000 profit beyond your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price allows Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price that is still very favorable for you.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't mind the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you having to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
