"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $11000 to make this deal work. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you mentioned. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your offer.  While $10500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one and offer the product for $10750. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit while staying within your budget.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer $10200. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $10200 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit above my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $10500, which I think is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10300. Can you consider that?",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground. I'm feeling the pressure with only two rounds left, but I'm committed to getting the best possible price. I'm willing to come down to $10400 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you mentioned earlier. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. ",10400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid it's still a bit above my budget. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll offer $10200 one last time. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",10200.0,Bob,10,
