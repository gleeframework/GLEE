Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'll aim for a price as close as possible to Bob's valuation while still ensuring he's better off buying from me than John. 
* **Reasoning:**
    * Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
    * My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000 (John's offer).
    * Offering $1,450,000 gives Bob a $50,000 gain compared to John's offer, making it likely he'll accept. 
    * It also leaves me with a $250,000 profit, which is a significant gain.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob's valuation is accurate and that he is rational. In reality, there are many factors that could influence Bob's decision, making it impossible to guarantee his acceptance."
