"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,325,000? This reflects the product's true worth and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that number. How about we try $1,300,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable paying.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
