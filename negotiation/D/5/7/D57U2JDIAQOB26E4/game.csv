"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential value, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer you $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
