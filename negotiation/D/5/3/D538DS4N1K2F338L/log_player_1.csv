Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and would be a significant asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly lower than your minimum, making it attractive to Bob. It's also much closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances risk and reward, giving you a strong chance of securing a higher profit with Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
