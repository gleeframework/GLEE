"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,100,000 is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,500. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1100500.0,Bob,4,
