"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to get a better deal. I'm not going to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $1,100,000 is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,500. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my original goal of $1,150,000, Bob's offer is just slightly lower. It's a good compromise, and with only 6 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the chance of a worse outcome in future rounds."
