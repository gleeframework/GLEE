Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $1,600,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

While I could push further, Bob seems firm on his $1,600,000 offer. It's a solid profit above my minimum, and further negotiation might risk losing him entirely."
