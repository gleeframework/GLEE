I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to go lower than my initial price, but not that low. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to a price we can both agree on."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is getting too low. It's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
