"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both of our positions.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation.  While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept that price.  I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,250,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a solution, but it's my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
