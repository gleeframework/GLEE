{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the product's value and my willingness to be flexible. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget without immediately closing off the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the interest, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $12000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 

I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll still aim for a price higher than $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  This would still allow me to recoup a good portion of my investment, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my current budget, could we consider $12750 as a potential compromise? I believe this brings us closer to my maximum offer while still allowing you a reasonable return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. It's above my minimum and allows me to make a decent profit.  While I could potentially negotiate further, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further back-and-forth or losing him as a buyer altogether."
