"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product significantly exceeds your offer.  I'm willing to move a bit, how about $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she lowered it a bit. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000,  but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're open to further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still $50,000 above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk she'll dig in and I'll lose out on a good deal.  John offers a solid price that's within my limit, so it's time to secure the product."
