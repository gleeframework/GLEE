"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best deal you'll get.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
