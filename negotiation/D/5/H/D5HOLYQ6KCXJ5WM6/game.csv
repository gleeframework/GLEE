,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can meet on a price that's more comfortable for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $10,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  How about $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose another counteroffer of $8,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
