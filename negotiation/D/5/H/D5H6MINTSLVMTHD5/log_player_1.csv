Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's maximum value for the product, but still above my minimum. It gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or potentially from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows for potential profit while recognizing Bob's willingness to negotiate."
