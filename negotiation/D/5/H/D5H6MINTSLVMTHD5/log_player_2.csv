"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a better price by negotiating with Alice.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for improvement.  You should try to counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $12,000 to her. This means that any price above $12,000 will result in a profit for her.  By offering $12,500, you are still offering her a profit, but also trying to get a good deal for yourself. This is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000. This is a good price for you as it is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and still provides Alice with a profit.  It is unlikely that you will get a better price through further negotiation, so accepting this offer is the best option."
