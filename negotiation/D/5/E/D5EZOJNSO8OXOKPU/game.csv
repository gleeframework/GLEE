"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects my desire to make this work. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting closer to a price point that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $11,250 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
