Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $15500? This price would be a good compromise for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $15,500 is a good price, especially considering I have a backup buyer in John. This deal ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal entirely."
