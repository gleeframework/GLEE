"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
