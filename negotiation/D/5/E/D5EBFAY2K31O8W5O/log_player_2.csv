Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer.
