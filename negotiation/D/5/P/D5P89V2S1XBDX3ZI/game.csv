"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant discount.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $15,500. I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",15500.0,Bob,4,
