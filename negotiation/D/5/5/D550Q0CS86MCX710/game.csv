"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit stretched on the budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,200? I really think this product could bring a lot of value to me, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my limits.",11200.0,Bob,4,
