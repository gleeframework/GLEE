"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1300000.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be happy to pay $1150000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. ",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1150000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1250000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product, while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
