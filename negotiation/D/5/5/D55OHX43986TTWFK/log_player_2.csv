"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but it's still higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $1,300,000.  Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'd be happy to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1150000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1250000. This price takes into account your budget and the value you see in the product, while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal for both of us.  It's within my budget and gives Alice a profit. Continuing to negotiate might get the price lower, but it also risks Alice walking away and leaving me to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to settle on this price."
