# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $715,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will walk away from the deal, forcing me to buy from John at the higher price. Accepting $715,000 is a good compromise."
