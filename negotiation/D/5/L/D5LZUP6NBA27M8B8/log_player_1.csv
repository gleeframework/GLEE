Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at $145 gives Bob a chance to get it for a price lower than its value to him ($120) while still netting me a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with an offer slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and highlights the potential value to Bob."
