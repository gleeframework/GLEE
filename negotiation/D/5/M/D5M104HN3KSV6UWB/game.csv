"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $10,750, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still think the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on the higher end.",11000.0,Alice,5,
