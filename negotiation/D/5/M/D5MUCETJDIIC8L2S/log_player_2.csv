"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for a steal at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. It's the lowest price I can go, but I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unwilling to budge below $100. Since John is offering the product at that price, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice.  I can get the product for the same price without further negotiation."
