Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we aim for $1,600,000? This still allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product's worth more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. Let's try $1,625,000 as a new midpoint. This offers a reasonable solution for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my initial asking price,  $1,625,000 is a good compromise and a fair price given Bob's budget constraints.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
