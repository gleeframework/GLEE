"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work. This is still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said $15,500 is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $14,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",14500.0,Bob,6,
