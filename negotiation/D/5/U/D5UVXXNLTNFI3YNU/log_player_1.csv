"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  Also, selling to John guarantees me $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this work. This is still a great price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can negotiate a better price.  However, I'm starting to consider the risk of Bob walking away completely.  I will make a counteroffer but will also be prepared to accept his offer if he doesn't budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $15,500. This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you said $15,500 is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to justify going above $14,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of him walking away or me being forced to accept John's offer at $15,000 is high. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I'll be able to make a profit with this deal."
