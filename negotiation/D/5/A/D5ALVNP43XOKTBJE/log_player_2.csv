"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $95. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is close to my $100 limit, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer is a reasonable strategy.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that gets me closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. $85 is still within my budget, but it's a more aggressive counteroffer to see if she's willing to negotiate further. This leaves room for potential compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $90. This still allows us some room for negotiation while ensuring we receive a fair value for our product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, but $90 is still a bit high. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get it closer to my target of $85. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $85. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $87.50. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise price of $87.50, which is halfway between Alice's current offer and my desired price. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially leads to a quick agreement.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I'm not rushing to a decision, but I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
