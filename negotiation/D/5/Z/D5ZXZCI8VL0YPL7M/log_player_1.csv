"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll be tempted by the deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $1,500 difference gives us room for potential counteroffers and compromise.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to explore those options. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed outcome:** While $12,000 is a good price, I'm motivated to get the best possible deal, which might be possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,250? It's still a great price for the product, and it would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his initial proposal.
* **Midpoint compromise:**  $10,250 is roughly the midpoint between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm willing to increase my offer a bit, how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to explore those options.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While $12,000 is a good price, I'm motivated to get the best possible deal, which might be possible with Bob.  However, I'm not willing to sell for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000,  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his initial proposal.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $10,000 is the exact middle point between Bob's latest offer and my previous offer. This shows further flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Clear minimum:**  I'm stating my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to set a clear boundary.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using a question to encourage Bob to respond positively and potentially close the deal."
