"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000).  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while still being a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $13,500 is still lower than John's price of $15,000 and is closer to Bob's ideal price.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's price.  Further negotiation might risk her rejecting the offer entirely, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing negotiations takes time, and Bob might be better off securing the product now at a reasonable price."
