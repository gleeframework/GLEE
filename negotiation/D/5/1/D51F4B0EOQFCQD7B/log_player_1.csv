{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above your minimum, but still attractive to Bob as it is below the product's worth to him.  This allows for room for negotiation without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,000 is a good deal, it is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'll reject this offer and counter-offer to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a decent profit while still being a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
