Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I'm aiming for a higher price and still have 8 rounds to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold ($10,000), but I'm still willing to negotiate. I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, how about $10,200? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. Would you be willing to consider $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and with only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better price. While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a safe and secure transaction, which meets my minimum threshold."
