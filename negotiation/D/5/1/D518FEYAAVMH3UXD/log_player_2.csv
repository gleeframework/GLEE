"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it really useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $105? That's the most I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down to $110, which is closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay from John.  Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially sensible choice."
