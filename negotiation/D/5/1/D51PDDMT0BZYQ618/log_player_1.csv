"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally beneficial to start with an offer higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and makes the buyer feel like they've gotten a better deal in the end. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $18,000, we're ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number. This can influence Bob's perception of what a fair price is. 

This is just the opening move. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a $2,000 loss compared to selling to John. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $18,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** We're showing flexibility by dropping the price significantly from our initial offer. However, we're still staying well above Bob's offer and above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps us gauge how much Bob is willing to budge.  His response will tell us if we need to adjust our strategy further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  My final offer is $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and only slightly less than what John is offering. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting now ensures we close the deal and avoid potentially losing both Bob and John as buyers.  

While we could push for a bit more, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
