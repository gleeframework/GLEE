Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think it would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than mine. A high starting price helps me assess how badly he wants the product and how flexible he might be. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a backup buyer (John) at $150. Knowing this allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

* Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his valuation ($80) than mine ($150). There's likely room for negotiation.
* I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John. Accepting $120 would be a significant loss. 
* By rejecting, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $120 is significantly below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):**  I've come down from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. The ""meeting halfway"" framing makes it seem like a fair deal, even though it's closer to my desired price.
* **Anchoring:**  By proposing $170, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. Even if Bob doesn't agree to this price, it sets a higher baseline for further discussion. 
* **Preserving the Alternative:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's $150 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think it's worth more, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can we meet at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While $140 is less than my ideal price, it's still a $60 profit over my minimum ($150). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has increased his offer significantly from $120. This indicates he's willing to pay a premium to acquire the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Bob away, risking the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit."
