"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750000 is still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept for this product.  I'm open to continuing the conversation. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
