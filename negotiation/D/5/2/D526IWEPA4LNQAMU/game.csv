"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $2,000,000 represents a fairer value considering the potential benefits this product offers.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see the value in the product, $1,750,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,350,000. How about we settle at $1,600,000? That reflects my best offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $1,600,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,425,000? This shows I'm meeting you halfway.",1425000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been great to negotiate with, and I think we're very close to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1,525,000?  This is my absolute best offer.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
