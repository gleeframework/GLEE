"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's high enough to maximize my potential profit, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds.  
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  While Bob's offer is acceptable, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He's already demonstrated a willingness to pay more than my minimum, and I can potentially push him closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm serious about getting a better deal and that I'm not desperate to sell. This could encourage him to raise his offer further.
* **Time Constraint:**  With 10 rounds remaining, I have time to explore other options and see if I can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10,500 doesn't quite meet my needs. How about we split the difference at $11,750? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between our last two offers. This is a common negotiation tactic that can show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good outcome.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, subtly suggesting that $11,750 is still a good deal.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** The counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $11,750 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will become less interested or walk away completely. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With 6 rounds remaining, accepting the offer provides a good profit without the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I'll be wasting valuable negotiation rounds."
