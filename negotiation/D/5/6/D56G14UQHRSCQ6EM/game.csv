"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,325,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Think about the value this product can bring to your business, and consider this offer carefully.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement. Would you consider $1,050,000? This is a substantial investment for me, and I need to ensure it aligns with my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I truly believe this product will generate much more revenue for your business.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,075,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
