Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that aligns with the product's true value.  Would you consider $975,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. Would you be willing to go down to $920,000 is too high for me, how about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $900,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly more than my minimum and Bob is clearly trying to stay within a reasonable range. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiations breaking down."
