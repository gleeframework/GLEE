"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that aligns with the product's true value.  Would you consider $975,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,,
