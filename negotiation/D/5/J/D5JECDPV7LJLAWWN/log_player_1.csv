Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leave room for compromise:** The $115 offer signals willingness to negotiate but still secures a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **The John factor:** Having a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net. I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a reasonable offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was quite close to my initial ask, suggesting he's quite interested. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $112?"", 
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm not dropping my price significantly, signaling that I believe in the product's value.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still above my safety net of $100, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking of making an offer of $108. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:** Bob's latest offer of $108 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and secures a decent profit. 
* **Diminishing returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob's incremental increases suggest he might not go much higher. 
* **Time value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth and potential delays."
