Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a tempting figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,112,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are still significantly above our minimum acceptable price. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get closer to $1,150,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I believe your current offer still undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,118,000. This is a very slight adjustment on my end, reflecting my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,112,500.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000.
