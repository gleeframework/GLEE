"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can do better.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $150, which is what the product is worth to him. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me more leverage to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about $115? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd ideally want more, $107 is significantly better than the $100 I'd get from John. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
