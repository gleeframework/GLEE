Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it leaves a significant margin for you while still allowing me to achieve a substantial profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $875,000, I'm still confident I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $887,500 for the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $887,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal and make this a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $880,000 is a good profit and it's only one round away from my floor price. It's better to lock in the deal now than risk losing it and having to settle with John."
