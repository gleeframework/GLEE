"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm trying to be a savvy buyer and save some money.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, as it's below your estimated value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $12,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $12,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
