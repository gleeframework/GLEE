"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence, but not arrogance, sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to Agreement:** Mentioning a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" implies you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  See how strongly he reacts to a high price.
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  We can come down in price while still staying above your minimum. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:** Remember, you always have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below your minimum.  While it's tempting to take a sure profit, there's room for negotiation. You have the leverage of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** We're coming down by $400,000, a substantial amount that might signal flexibility to Bob. However, we're still well above both your minimum and his initial offer.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the ""product's true worth"" and ""middle ground,"" we're anchoring the price in a zone of value rather than just haggling. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We're not rushing to accept a lower offer. We have time and the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit."
