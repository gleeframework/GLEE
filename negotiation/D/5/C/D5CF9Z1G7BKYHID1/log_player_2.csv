"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget and your maximum willingness to pay. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both recognize the inherent value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though she came down from $2,300,000, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  It's better to continue negotiations to see if we can get closer to my target price, while still keeping the option to buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
