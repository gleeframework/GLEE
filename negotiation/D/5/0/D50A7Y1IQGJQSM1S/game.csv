"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. The value this product holds for you is significant, and I believe a price closer to $1200000 would be fair for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, and I see we're getting closer to an agreement. While $1100000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1150000. It's a fair price that reflects the value you place on this product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
