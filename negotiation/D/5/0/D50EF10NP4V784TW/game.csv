"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. Can we discuss the possibility of a compromise at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I've already compromised a lot from my initial offer of $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
