"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you meet me at $11,500? It's a strong compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from $11,500. Could you consider meeting me at $11,000? It's still a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
