,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",97.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we try $96? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",96.0,Bob,6,
