Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential concessions if needed. It also acknowledges the value to Bob while still aiming for a significant profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not ready to pay that much.  Considering your cost and my budget, I'm offering $950000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still below Alice's desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and provides me a fair profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $975000? This would give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, $975,000 is a good deal for Alice. It's significantly higher than selling to John and is closer to her desired profit margin. While further negotiation might yield a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away entirely is too high."
