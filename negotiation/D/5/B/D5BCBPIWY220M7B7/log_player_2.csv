Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,220,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's already very close to her own valuation of the product.  Continuing to push is unlikely to yield a significantly better price and risks pushing her away from the deal entirely."
