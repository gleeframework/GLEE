"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,225,000.
