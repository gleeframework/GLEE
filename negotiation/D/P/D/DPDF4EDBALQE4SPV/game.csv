"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This price still allows you to get a great deal on the product, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet at $9,250? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Can you consider my revised offer?",9250.0,Bob,4,
