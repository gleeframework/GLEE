Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. Let's meet halfway - I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. This would allow both of us to achieve a fair outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting the $1,475,000 offer secures a significant profit above John's offer."
