Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.
