,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering both our perspectives and will allow us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is my final offer, as I know I have another buyer at that price point.",14500.0,Alice,5,
