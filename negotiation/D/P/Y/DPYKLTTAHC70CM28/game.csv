"Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that far. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more flexibility. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This gives us both some wiggle room, and I'm confident this is a fair price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $10,900? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to meet in the middle. Let's make this happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
