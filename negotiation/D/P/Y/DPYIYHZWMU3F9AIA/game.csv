"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we meet at $1050000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you a price of $1025000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.
