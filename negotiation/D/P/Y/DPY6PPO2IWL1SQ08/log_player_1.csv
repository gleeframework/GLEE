Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to earn more than $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a higher value for the product, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to meet in the middle.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  It shows you're confident in the value of your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum goal of $1,000,000. You have a chance to get closer to your ideal price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counteroffer Bob. Aim for a price that's closer to your initial offer and still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,100,000? "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Your Goal:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while getting you closer to your desired price. 
* **Compromise:** It's a compromise from your original offer, showing you're willing to work with Bob.
* **Reasoning:** You're providing a clear justification for your counteroffer, making it more likely Bob will consider it.

Let's see if this counteroffer is enough to convince Bob!"
