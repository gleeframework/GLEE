"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. This might seem aggressive, but it gives me room to negotiate down and still get a decent profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low for me.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied.  I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of him before I go with John's offer.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm getting close to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to secure a deal that's more favorable than selling to John.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement that meets my needs.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
