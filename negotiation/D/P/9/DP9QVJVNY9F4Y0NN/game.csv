"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Considering your own value of the product, I'm offering $1200000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal right now at $1250000. This is a good price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1325000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
