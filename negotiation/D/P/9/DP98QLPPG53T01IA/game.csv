"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $12,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
