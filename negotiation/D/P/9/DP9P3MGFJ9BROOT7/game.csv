"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds tremendous value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  This price reflects the significant potential I see in this product.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to provide you with more details.  However, I want to be upfront - this is a limited-time offer. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1000000.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
