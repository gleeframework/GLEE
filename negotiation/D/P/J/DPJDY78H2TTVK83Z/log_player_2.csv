"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation environment. We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice moved closer to her value, which is a good sign. It suggests she's willing to negotiate. We still have room to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Not at Our Limit:**  $85 is still significantly above our ideal price. We can afford to push back a little further without risking the deal too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $70 is low, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $77?"", 
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a compromise that sits almost exactly between our previous offer ($70) and her counteroffer ($85). This shows willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Still Beneficial:** $77 is still a significant saving compared to John's price ($100) and a reasonable price below our maximum budget. 
* **Creating Urgency (Slightly):** By offering a specific number, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Alice to respond quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  How about $81 to make this a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow and Steady:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and move closer to a price we both find agreeable. We're doing well by making small concessions.
* **Not Quite There:** While $81 is tempting, we're only a few dollars away from potentially securing an even better deal. 
* **Limited Risk:** We still have several rounds left, and the difference between her offer and John's price is shrinking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I can do $79, and I think that's more than fair."", 
""product_price"": 79
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concessions:**  We're continuing the pattern of small incremental increases to show willingness to compromise, but without conceding too much too quickly.
* **Psychological Price Point:** $79 feels significantly different than $80 or $81, potentially making Alice more likely to accept.
* **Final Offer Implication:** The tone of the message implies this is our best offer, adding a bit of pressure for Alice to accept."
