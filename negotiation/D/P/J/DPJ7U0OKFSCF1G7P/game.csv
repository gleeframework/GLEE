"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000 yet. I can do $1,050,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
