"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Starting with a low offer gives us room to negotiate and see how much Alice is willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice is still significantly above our backup price with John. We need to keep negotiating."

}

We're increasing our offer substantially to show Alice we're serious while still leaving space to negotiate before reaching John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000 yet. I can do $1,050,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're now close enough to John's price that it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal."
