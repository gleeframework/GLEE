"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even my own minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Presentation:** Highlighting the product's unique value and my confidence in its worth can influence Bob's perception and potentially lead him to accept a higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While John's offer is tempting, securing a deal above my minimum with Bob is ideal.  This first offer is a calculated risk to see if a significantly higher price is achievable before considering John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but selling to John is becoming increasingly appealing as a secure option. By rejecting and countering, I aim to close the gap quickly or potentially take John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on its value.  However, the price needs to reflect the true uniqueness and worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price. This signals my willingness to negotiate but keeps me firmly above my minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the high price point, even with the reduction. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're nearing the halfway point in negotiations, and the offer of $1,000,000 from John is looking more attractive as a safe bet. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to make significant moves if he wants to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's uniqueness, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating more slowly than I'd hoped. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for him to move. Rejecting keeps the pressure on, but I'll need to be ready to accept a smaller increase in the next round or seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm open to closing this deal, but the price needs to reflect the true value of what you're getting.  How about we settle at $1,300,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Concession:**  I'm dropping my price, but only slightly, signaling that this is a serious offer and likely my bottom line.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""this is my final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. He's now aware that I have other options and may walk away.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Half the rounds are gone. This offer keeps the potential for a deal with Bob alive, but prepares me to shift to John if needed in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000 for the product, but that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  While not my ideal target, $1,275,000 is a substantial profit and significantly above my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push Bob could backfire. He's signaled his firm limit, and I risk him walking away completely. John's offer is secure, but accepting Bob's counteroffer nets me an additional $275,000.
* **Time Factor:**  With only four rounds remaining, accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of protracted negotiations."
