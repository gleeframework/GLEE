"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a product that's worth a lot more to you than that.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your offer. I'm proposing a price of $887500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. I believe it's worth considering.",887500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825000 is still a bit too high for me. Can we try to get even closer to my target price? I'd be willing to meet you at $850000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to reduce the price to $900000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit above the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you at my previous offer of $850000. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to consider buying from John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
