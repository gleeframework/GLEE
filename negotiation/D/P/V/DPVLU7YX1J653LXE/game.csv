"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to spend while still recognizing the product's worth to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,400,000 is a very fair reflection of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a strong alternative buyer lined up.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. This price is closer to what I am willing to pay, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
