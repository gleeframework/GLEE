Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than Bob's value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation, but still above your minimum of $12,000. It also shows you're willing to compromise and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $14,000.  I'm really interested, but I'm only able to go up to $13,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is more than your minimum, it's still below the price you initially offered. Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
