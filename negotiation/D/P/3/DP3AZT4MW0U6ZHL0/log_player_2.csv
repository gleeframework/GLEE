# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair deal considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
