Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one.

Alice is clearly very attached to that $10,000 mark and is unlikely to go much lower.  Accepting at $10,750 secures a good deal for you while avoiding the risk of her pulling out of the negotiations entirely."
