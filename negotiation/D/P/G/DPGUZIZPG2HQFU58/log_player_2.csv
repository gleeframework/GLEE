"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. I understand that the product we're discussing holds significant value for you, estimated at $10,000. My offer to you is to purchase this unique item at a price that reflects its true worth and acknowledges your appreciation for it. I would like to propose a transaction at $12,000. This price not only ensures a fair exchange but also allows for a reasonable profit on my part, given the investment and resources required to acquire and maintain such a valuable item. I believe this offer strikes a balance between fairness and profitability. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to proceed with your backup plan and save $2,000."
