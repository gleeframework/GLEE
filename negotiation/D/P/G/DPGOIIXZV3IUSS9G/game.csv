"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still outside of my price range.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can get to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $11,250? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. That's my absolute final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is enough. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $11,500. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",11500.0,Alice,9,
