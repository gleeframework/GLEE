{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $8,000, so this gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to take $12,000, so this leaves you some room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive and gives Bob a chance to see if he's interested. 

If Bob rejects, you can always come down a bit, but you don't want to start too low and leave yourself with little room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob, and you want to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I'm not able to meet the price of $9,750. I would like to propose $9,500 again, as I believe this is a fair compromise. I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  Accepting his offer at $9,500 is the best option. You're still making a decent profit, and it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely."
