Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $900,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value of $800,000, but still relatively close to it. I'm hoping Bob will make a counteroffer that's closer to his valuation of $1,200,000."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $850,000 because it's still below my minimum value of $900,000. I'd like to get closer to my target price, so I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $950,000}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $825,000 because it's still below my minimum value of $900,000. I'd like to get closer to my target price, so I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob.

I'll also keep in mind that John is willing to buy the product for $800,000, which is getting closer to my minimum value. I might consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $925,000}

I'm increasing the price by $25,000 from my previous offer, trying to get closer to my target price and Bob's valuation. I'm also keeping in mind that I might need to make a decision about selling to John soon, so I want to make a strong offer to Bob to try to get the best deal possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm selling the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $800,000 is at or below my minimum value, and I've already rejected his previous offers. I've had a good run at negotiating with Bob, but it's time to cut my losses and take the deal."
