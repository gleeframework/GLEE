{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value, especially if he really wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is above my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm confident I can find a buyer in the future who will be willing to pay more, but it's risky to keep negotiating and potentially miss out on this sale."
