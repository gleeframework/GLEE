"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,500?  This would be a great deal for you and would allow me to sell the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'd be willing to do $12,100. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",12100.0,Bob,6,
