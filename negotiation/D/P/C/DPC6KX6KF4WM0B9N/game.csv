"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000. This price still allows for a good deal for both of us, considering the product's unique value. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This price reflects the product's unique value and offers a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
