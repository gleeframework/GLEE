Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while still making the sale.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $80 (Bob's value) or less leaves money on the table. 
* **Below Your Minimum:**  Offering it at $120 (your minimum) means no profit if Bob declines.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is a strong starting point. It's a price that could entice Bob while still giving you a significant profit margin. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
