"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to move a bit, how about $1,000,000 even? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to move closer to my target price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm thinking of $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
