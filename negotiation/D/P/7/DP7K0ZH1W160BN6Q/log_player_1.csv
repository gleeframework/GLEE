Round 2

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $130 is still a bit low, but I want to see if I can push him higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $130 is tempting, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $130 is tempting, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're holding firm on $130.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  I'm only able to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a good value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $129 is getting too close to my minimum of $100, and I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
