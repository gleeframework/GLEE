"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $130 is tempting, I'm hoping for something a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's still a great deal for a product worth $150 to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $130 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're holding firm on $130.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway,  I'm only able to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a good value.  What do you say?",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $132. How about $129? I'm trying to stay as close to my target price as possible.",129.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $129 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",130.0,Alice,7,
