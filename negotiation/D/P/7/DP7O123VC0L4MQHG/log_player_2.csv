"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price or buy it from John for $80. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $80 maximum.  It also conveys strong interest in the product, which might encourage Alice to accept a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our price range, but $85 is still above what John is offering. We should try to negotiate a bit further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're proposing a price point directly between our last offer and Alice's counter-offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below our maximum.  Framing it as a ""win-win"" might make it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $75 is still a bit low for me. How about $80? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John, as they both offer the same price now.  We'll accept Alice's offer."
