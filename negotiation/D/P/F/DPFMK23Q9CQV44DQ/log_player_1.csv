"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for closer to my value of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's trying to meet me halfway, $980,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm going to try to get him to move a little closer to my desired price range before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, but $980,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference, how about $1,040,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a wise investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get a good deal, but I need to make sure it's worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price that works for me.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
