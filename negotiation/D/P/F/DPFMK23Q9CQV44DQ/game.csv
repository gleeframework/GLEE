"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, but $980,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference, how about $1,040,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a wise investment for you.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get a good deal, but I need to make sure it's worth it.",950000.0,Bob,6,
