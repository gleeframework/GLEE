Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering Bob values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering $170. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $165.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $170, it's a good deal considering Bob's previous rejection and the risk of losing the sale to John."
