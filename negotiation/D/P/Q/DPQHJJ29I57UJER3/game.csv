"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $16000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to be flexible, but $14000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14500? This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay $14500. I'm willing to pay $13800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",13800.0,Bob,6,
