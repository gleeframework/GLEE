Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. I've given it some thought, and to be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit and me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
