"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the negotiation and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to find a middle ground, $950,000 doesn't quite do it for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,025,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that we're close, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This price is fair, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to meet my own financial goals. Let's seal the deal and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. I think this price is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",985000.0,Bob,8,
