Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a strong opening offer, as it's significantly more than my minimum price of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob as it's still below his perceived value of $12,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my ideal selling price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price.  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also maintains a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob as it is closer to his perceived value than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $11,000, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or a deal falling through is too high. It's likely that I won't get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would only yield $10,000.  Therefore, accepting this offer ensures a safe and profitable sale."
