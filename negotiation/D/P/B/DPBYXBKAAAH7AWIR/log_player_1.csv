"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for a high-quality item, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and Bob's perceived value. I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $9,500 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm still only two rounds away from the end of the negotiations.  I believe I can still push for a price closer to $9,000.  There's a chance Bob might accept a slightly higher price in the next round to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,850.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my desired price range. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8850}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to take a slightly bigger hit and meet me at $8,700? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at the halfway point in the negotiations.  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, but he's still significantly below my desired price. With only four rounds left, the chance of closing a deal with Bob at a price closer to my goal is low.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option that guarantees a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
