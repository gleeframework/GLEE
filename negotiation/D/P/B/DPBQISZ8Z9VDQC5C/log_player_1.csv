Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this strategy will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product at a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, and while I could counter, there is no guarantee he'll budge. John's offer is my minimum, and it's the safest choice to ensure I don't lose out on my desired value."
