"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $8,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and this price would be fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,200? It's a fair price that's closer to what I'm looking for, but still a great deal for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $9,200 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,800.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! $8,800 is a good step, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target.",9000.0,Alice,5,
