"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $110?  That's a good price for both of us and allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $107.50. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to consider other options.",107.5,Bob,4,
