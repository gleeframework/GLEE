"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to negotiate. Could you meet me at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll meet the $12,000 I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it makes the most sense to take that deal."
