"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, it's still worth exploring if you can get a better price.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice's minimum is $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within your budget and gets you closer to your target price. It's a good compromise, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal. Accepting the offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
