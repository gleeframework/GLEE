"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
