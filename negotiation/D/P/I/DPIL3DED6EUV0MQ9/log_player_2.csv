{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $13,000 when you can get it from John for $12,000.  Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a lower price to see if we can find some common ground.  $11,000 is still a fair price for the product, considering its value to me."

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still too high. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if we can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $11,500. It's a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than what Alice is currently offering."

Alice's offer of $12,000 is the same price as John's. Since I want to buy the product, I'll accept her offer to close the deal."
