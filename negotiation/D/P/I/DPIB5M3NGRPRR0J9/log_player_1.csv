Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation but signals the product's value to you.
2. **Justification:**  Provide a brief, plausible reason for the high price (e.g., market demand, unique features).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its current market demand and unique features, I'm valuing it at $1,475,000. I'm confident this represents a strong investment opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1475000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:**  The $1,475,000 starting point is a strong position.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market demand"" and ""unique features"" provides a rationale without revealing your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below $1,500,000. 
* **Walk-Away Power:** Your ability to sell to John gives you leverage. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob won't meet a price you find acceptable."
