Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting point.** $20,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but not so high that it's immediately off-putting.
* **It leaves room for negotiation.**  The message clearly states you're open to negotiating, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **It's a good opening to learn about Bob's perceived value.**  By asking ""What do you think?"" you can gauge Bob's interest level and potentially learn how much he's willing to pay. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Understand your leverage:**  If you have other interested buyers or if the product is very valuable, you can start at a higher price. If you're desperate to sell, you might need to start lower. 
* **The art of negotiation:**  This is just the first offer. Be prepared to adjust based on Bob's reaction,  consider his counteroffers, and use your best judgment to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer is still too low, and you have leverage. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15,000 is your minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $17,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum, and you've already rejected his previous offer. Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but it's likely to be a lot more effort and time.  It's better to take the $16,000 and move on."
