"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $10,000, but still wants to secure a significant discount. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is very close to Bob's ideal price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the limited rounds remaining make accepting this offer the most strategic choice. Bob can save $200 compared to buying from John, and the deal is likely to be close to Alice's minimum acceptable price."
