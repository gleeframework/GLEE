"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the potential benefits I see.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price, I understand the need to find common ground.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver a strong return on your investment.  What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. Given the product's value to me,  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this price represents a fair balance between our needs, and allows us to both achieve a positive outcome.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're making progress.  While your offer is still below my initial expectations, I recognize your desire for a fair deal.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
