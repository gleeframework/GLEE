# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price, or ultimately purchase the product from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective. While $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price, I understand the need to find common ground.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver a strong return on your investment.  What are your thoughts on this revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially push for a lower price, or secure the product from John at a more favorable price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range. Given the product's value to me,  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. I believe this price represents a fair balance between our needs, and allows us to both achieve a positive outcome."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're making progress.  While your offer is still below my initial expectations, I recognize your desire for a fair deal.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still outside your budget of $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that you won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. Given the opportunity to buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that option.  You'll save a significant amount of money compared to any offer Alice is likely to make."
