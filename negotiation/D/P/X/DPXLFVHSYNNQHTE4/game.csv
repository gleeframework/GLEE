"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This aligns more closely with the value I place on the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to see $900,000 to make this work.  Let's keep the conversation going, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
