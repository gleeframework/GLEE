"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we settle around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,5,
