"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price.  Could you consider $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but there's still some room for negotiation.  Rejecting again allows Bob to keep trying to push the price lower.  It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further, or that another counteroffer from Bob might lead to a deal."
