"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'll come down to $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",15500.0,Alice,5,
