"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its true value."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer close to my minimum value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""fair price considering its true value"") might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm aware that Bob values the product less, so this offer allows for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to make a deal, accepting $900,000 would mean a $300,000 loss compared to selling to John. I'll counter-offer in the next round to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've reduced my price by $50,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal by emphasizing the product's inherent value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims for a middle ground while still keeping the price above the midpoint between our initial positions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but $950,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer. I need to hold firm and see if I can nudge Bob closer to a more acceptable price. I'll continue the negotiation in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,025,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm reducing my price by $25,000, a smaller step that signals I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer is a clear attempt to meet Bob closer to the middle of the remaining price gap.
* **Urgency and Compromise:**  By stating my desire to ""close the deal"" and calling it a ""significant compromise,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency and highlighting my flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but I believe there's still some room for negotiation. Bob is consistently increasing his offer by $25,000, indicating a willingness to move towards my price point. Accepting $975,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer.  I'll use the next round to push for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground here.  To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm at my limit. 
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession of $15,000, indicating I'm firming up my position. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that this is a ""fair deal,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness while still aiming for a price above $1 million.

**The next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a deal that's still significantly better than my alternative.
* **If Bob counters:**  I'll have to seriously consider if his counter-offer is close enough to justify continuing or if it's time to walk away and accept John's offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,010,000. I'm willing to go up to $985,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses.  While Bob is slowly moving towards my price point, it's clear he's unwilling to meet me at a level that's significantly better than my alternative. 

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer of $985,000 is only a $10,000 increase from his last offer. This indicates he might be reaching his maximum price, and further negotiation could be fruitless.
* **Opportunity Cost:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially ending up with no deal is too high. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $1,200,000 secures my desired profit margin, and it's more advantageous than risking a lower final offer from Bob."
