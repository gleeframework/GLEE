Round 5
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $870,000, which is only $10,000 more than my last counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this offer as it is a good deal for me and I have several rounds remaining if I need to continue negotiating.  It's better than risking going to John and paying $1,000,000."
