Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high probability of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **It's significantly better than selling to John:**  I'm getting $200,000 more than I would if I sold to John.
* **It's still attractive to Bob:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so a price of $1,400,000 is still a good deal for him, allowing him to make a profit of $100,000.

This offer gives Bob a strong incentive to accept, while still allowing me to make a substantial profit."
