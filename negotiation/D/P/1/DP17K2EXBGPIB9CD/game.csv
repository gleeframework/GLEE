"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair for both of us. It's a significant discount from what you'd likely pay elsewhere. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I think we can find a price closer to the product's true value for me. I propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, but I would like to negotiate further. Could we agree on $1,000,000 for the product?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This price represents a good compromise, and it ensures both of us get a fair deal.  Let's finalize this now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
