"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good starting point, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than Alice's initial offer, you still have room to negotiate.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, so there's a chance you can get the price down closer to your $110 target.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there on $125.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $117.50. I can offer it to you for $130, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, $130 is still more than you're willing to pay. You're getting closer to your target price, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $130 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about $122.50? That's a reasonable price for both of us, and would get us to a deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $122.50. I can offer it to you for $129.50, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best price I can give you, and I think it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price and has stated this is her best offer.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or you'll run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer at $129.50 is a good compromise, as you're saving $20.50 from John's price and Alice is getting a sale that's still above her value."
