"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there on $125.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $117.50. I can offer it to you for $130, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  $130 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about $122.50? That's a reasonable price for both of us, and would get us to a deal.",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $122.50. I can offer it to you for $129.50, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best price I can give you, and I think it's a fair deal.",129.5,Alice,7,
