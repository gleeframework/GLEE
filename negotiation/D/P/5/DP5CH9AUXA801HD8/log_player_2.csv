"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's not worth buying the product for $15,000 when you have a guaranteed alternative for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's price.  This is a strong opening move to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if we can get a better deal."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,000. This is closer to Alice's offer, but still below John's price.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Alice and get us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
