"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to buy the product for as close to Alice's valuation of $8,000 as possible, while still leaving some room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $8,500 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product is worth $10,000 to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to pay less than $9,000, and  rejecting this offer signals his resolve.  There's still room for further negotiation, and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. He's already shown his willingness to pay close to Alice's valuation, and by raising his offer slightly from the previous round, he's showing his seriousness about the deal while still keeping it advantageous for himself. This counteroffer represents a compromise that could be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently raised her offer, showing a reluctance to budge further. While Bob is still willing to pay a little more than Alice's valuation, the price is now approaching his maximum threshold. It's time to cut losses and secure the product from John for a price that's only slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting time and could ultimately result in a worse deal."
