"I understand you think the product is not that good, but I have to make a living, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. How about we compromise at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but that price is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000. It's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I'm not going to go any lower than $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
