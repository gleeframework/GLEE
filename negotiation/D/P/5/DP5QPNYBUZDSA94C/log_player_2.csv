"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within your budget, you can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is within your budget and a good price considering your maximum willingness to pay is $150.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
