"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to consider this offer.  If he still rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price. Bob has shown some flexibility, and I believe a compromise is within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. It's risky to continue, as I might not be able to secure a higher price in the remaining time, and I could end up with nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
