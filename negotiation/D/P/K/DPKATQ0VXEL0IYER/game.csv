"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $1200000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1200000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. This price still allows me to profit and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the potential of the product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a profit.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1400000 is still a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $1550000. This would give you a great deal on the product, and it would allow me to cover my costs.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1550000 is still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to close a profitable sale.  I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
