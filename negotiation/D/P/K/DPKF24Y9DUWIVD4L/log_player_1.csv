Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still higher than Bob's perceived value ($120), so there's a chance he'll accept if he really wants the product and is willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you suspect Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to give yourself more bargaining power.
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell the product quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more appealing to Bob."
