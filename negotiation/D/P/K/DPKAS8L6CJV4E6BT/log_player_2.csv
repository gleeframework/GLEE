"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $150.  This is more than you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $120, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
