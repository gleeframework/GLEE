"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. Let me know if that works for you!",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but my budget is quite limited. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still working within a tight budget. Could we possibly meet at $16000? This would allow us to both reach an agreement that is reasonable for both parties.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $16000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $19000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued effort to accommodate my budget, Alice. However, I am unable to meet you at $19000. I would like to propose $17000 as a compromise. This would be the highest I can go while still staying within my financial constraints.",17000.0,Bob,6,
