Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for it, and if not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $95, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing him and ending up with $100 from John."
