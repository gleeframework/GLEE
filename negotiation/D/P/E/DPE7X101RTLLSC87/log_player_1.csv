Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $119. This is a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120 gives me leverage in this negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
