"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you, and allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I can't quite meet that price.  Would you consider $825,000? It's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
