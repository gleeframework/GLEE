"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you, and allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. This is my final offer.
