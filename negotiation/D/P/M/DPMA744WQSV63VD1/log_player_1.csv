Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations with Bob significantly above his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your safety net.
* **Slight room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your confidence in its benefits to Bob, aiming to influence his perception and encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by first attempting to secure a price closer to your ideal selling point. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
