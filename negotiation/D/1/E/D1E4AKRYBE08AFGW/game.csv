"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it. This price represents a substantial return on your investment, and I believe it's fair given the product's potential. Let's discuss this further, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
