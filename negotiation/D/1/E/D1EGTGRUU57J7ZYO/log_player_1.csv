Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.
