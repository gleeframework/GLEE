"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's only $50,000 below my maximum budget, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,125,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still $25,000 more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm going to counter again and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
