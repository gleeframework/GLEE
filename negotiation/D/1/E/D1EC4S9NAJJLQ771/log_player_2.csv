{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You have no idea how much the product is worth to her. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is well below Alice's initial offer, leaving room for a potential compromise while still remaining within my budget."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $850,000 is still too high. There's still room for further negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't overpay."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to raise my offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  $775,000 is a significant increase from my previous offer, indicating that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's current offer, giving us both some room to negotiate.  With only five rounds left, I need to start closing the gap."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $812,500 is still above my target range. I'm not ready to settle yet, and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  We're down to the last few rounds, and I need to keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, I'm making a significant jump in my offer, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal. $800,000 is a significant amount, but it's still below Alice's offer.  I'm taking a calculated risk that Alice will see this as a fair compromise and accept, knowing I can always fall back on John if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round. It's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers, as I could end up buying from John at a much higher price. While $810,000 is still above my ideal target, it's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better offer in this limited time. It's time to close the deal."
