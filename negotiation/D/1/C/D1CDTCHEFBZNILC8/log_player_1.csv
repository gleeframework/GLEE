{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still attractive to him. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, which will be helpful if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind and be willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really hoping to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still lower than my minimum desired value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  This will give me a better chance of getting a price closer to my minimum while still potentially closing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but not too much.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired value, I'm going to reject it for now.  I'm willing to negotiate further but am also aware that I have a solid alternative with John.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price point. This offer is a small compromise that shows flexibility while still allowing me to potentially reach a favorable outcome.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to accept."
