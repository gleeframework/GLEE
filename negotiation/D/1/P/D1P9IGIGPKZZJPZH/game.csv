"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's see if we can find common ground!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8700? I think this is a reasonable compromise, and it would allow me to get the product at a price that works for both of us.",8700.0,Bob,4,
