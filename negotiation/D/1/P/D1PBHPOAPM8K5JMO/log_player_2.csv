"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That's still a great price for a product worth more than that.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to spend. You've already rejected Alice's previous offer, and there's no guarantee she'll budge further. It's better to lock in the guaranteed $120 price with John."
