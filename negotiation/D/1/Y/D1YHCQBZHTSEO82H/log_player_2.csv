"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's best to start negotiating with Alice and see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
