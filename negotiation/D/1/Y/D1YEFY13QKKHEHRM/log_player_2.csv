Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To make this happen, I'll come down to $127. That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, her ""final offer"" is still higher than John's price.  It's unlikely she'll go below $127, so it's more beneficial to buy from John at this point and secure the lower price."
