"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I think this product is great, $140 is a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,3,
