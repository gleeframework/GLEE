"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
