Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message positions the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By aiming high initially, you increase your chances of getting closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having a backup plan."
