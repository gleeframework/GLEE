"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $600,000 is too low.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue discussing a fair price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still a bit wide for me. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That's a fair price considering the market value.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $750,000? I'm willing to be decisive to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer with his offers, the negotiation is taking longer than I'd prefer, and I'm concerned we may not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the secure option and sell to John for $1,000,000."
