"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my budget under $8000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $8250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $8000 for the product?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'd like to counteroffer at $8200. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
