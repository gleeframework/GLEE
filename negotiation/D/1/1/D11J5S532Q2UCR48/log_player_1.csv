Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Given the potential return on investment, I believe this is a very competitive offer. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** We're aiming high because the worst-case scenario is selling to John for $1,500,000.  There's room to negotiate downwards if Bob shows resistance.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential worth to Bob justifies the high price. We're not just stating a number; we're anchoring it to the value Bob would receive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative, not demanding.  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob into the conversation and signals flexibility.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine the next move in the negotiation."
