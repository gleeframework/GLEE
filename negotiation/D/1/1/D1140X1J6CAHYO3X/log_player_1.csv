Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and the unique benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I want to start high with Bob to see if I can significantly exceed that amount.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a random high number. The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the tone remains open for discussion (""What are your thoughts?"").  This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still above my minimum."
