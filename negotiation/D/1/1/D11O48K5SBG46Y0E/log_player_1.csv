Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $22,000, I'm setting a high anchor.  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this starting point and be closer to my desired range. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer will give me information about Bob's willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to significantly adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and my initial offer. Accepting this would be leaving a lot of money on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you do $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial drop from $22,000 to $18,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still well above my absolute minimum price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying my higher price.
* **Encouraging Movement:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to move closer to my range. I'm hoping he'll meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could potentially push for a bit more, the difference is relatively small. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
