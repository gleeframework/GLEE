"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still reflects the product's significant value while allowing for a fair compromise. I believe this price represents a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,050,000. This price should be more comfortable for both of us. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
