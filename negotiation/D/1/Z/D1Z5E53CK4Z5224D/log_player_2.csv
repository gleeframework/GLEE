"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and Interested:**  Keeps the negotiation friendly and shows we're still engaged.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting significantly lower than our target ($60 vs. $80) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Open-ended:** Doesn't commit us to a specific price, allowing Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer, but $90 is still above our maximum. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $90 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Would you be willing to go any lower?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We recognize Alice's compromise, building goodwill.
* **Budget Justification:** Giving a reason (""tight budget"") makes our position more understandable.
* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving up from $60, showing we're willing to pay *something* more.
* **Still Open-Ended:** We leave room for Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $70, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to negotiate further, $85 is only slightly above our ideal price, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a reasonable deal now than risk the price going back up or missing out entirely."
