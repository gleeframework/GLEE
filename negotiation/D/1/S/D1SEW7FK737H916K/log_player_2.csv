Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1100000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being a fair reflection of its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially not getting a better deal.  You are guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price by buying from John."
