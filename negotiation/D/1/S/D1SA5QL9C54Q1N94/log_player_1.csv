Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, maximizing your profit while ensuring you don't go below your guaranteed amount. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its benefits. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Targeting the High End:** By starting at $1,400,000, you're aiming for a significant profit margin while still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Language:** Phrases like ""special price"" and ""fair deal"" are used to frame the offer positively.
* **Clear Call to Action:** You directly ask for Bob's decision, encouraging a prompt response.

**Important Note:**

 This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly lower if you want to increase the chances of Bob accepting quickly. However, it's crucial to balance that against the potential profit you'd be giving up."
