"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $150, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150."
