**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and we are getting close to a price point that might make sense.  However, I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000.  I'll make one more strong counter-offer before considering John."

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly beyond his $980,000 offer. It's time to cut my losses. Selling to John for the full $1,200,000 is the best decision at this point to ensure I receive the product's full value."
