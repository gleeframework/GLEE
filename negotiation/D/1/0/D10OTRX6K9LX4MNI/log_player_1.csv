Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $1,000,000, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a potential $50,000 profit if he leverages the product effectively.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning another buyer, I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
