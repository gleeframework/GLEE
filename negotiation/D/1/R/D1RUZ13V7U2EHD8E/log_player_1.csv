Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob sees a strong incentive to buy. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and straightforward, highlighting the value Bob will gain. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:**  $1,000,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message is open-ended, prompting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** By keeping the negotiation open, I have the option to accept a counteroffer or make my own if needed. 
* **Have a backup option:** The option to sell to John for $800,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original asking price.  I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to $1,000,000.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** This allows me to counter with a price that is still favorable to me while giving Bob the opportunity to further negotiate. 
* **Avoid settling too early:** Accepting $900,000 would be a missed opportunity, especially considering the value the product holds for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still being beneficial to me.
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob to justify the price. 
* **Open-ended message:** This allows for further negotiation and leaves room for Bob to adjust his offer if needed. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** While I'm willing to negotiate, my counteroffer keeps the price above my minimum and demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value. 
* **Signal a willingness to compromise:** Offering a price in the middle shows flexibility and encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Keep the door open for further negotiation:** This approach keeps the conversation flowing and increases the chance of reaching an agreement that benefits both of us."
