"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $132. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to go above $125, and I respect that. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132 and $125, which would be $128.50. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",128.5,Alice,7,
