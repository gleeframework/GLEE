Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's still less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm not willing to settle for just $10 more than my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value Bob places on the product, and it will hopefully lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only $8 more than John's offer, it's still a better outcome for me than selling to John.  It's closer to my desired price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
