"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000.  This is my best price, and I believe it's fair considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.  This price reflects the value to me and allows for some room for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and is as high as I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $925,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $937,500, meeting you halfway. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's make this happen. ",937500.0,Alice,7,
