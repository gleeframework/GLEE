"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer ($110) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $110 is close to my minimum, it still leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob recognizes the value of the product (worth $120 to him) and is willing to pay more than my minimum ($80).
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum, and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Seeking a Better Price:**  I believe I can potentially get a higher price by rejecting this offer and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and still a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going too low. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $100 is still significantly above my minimum and provides a good profit for me.
* **Reiterating Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, encouraging him to consider this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for a Deal:**  Bob seems motivated to buy, and we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.  I don't want to risk losing this potential sale by being too stubborn."
