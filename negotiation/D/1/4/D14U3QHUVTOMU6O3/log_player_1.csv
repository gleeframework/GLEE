Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good price as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,000,000, making it appealing to Bob. However, it's still a good profit for me. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the mutual benefit of the deal. It opens the door for negotiation without being overly aggressive.

**Reasoning:**

This offer allows for several possible outcomes:

* **Bob accepts:** Great! I secure a good sale.
* **Bob rejects and counteroffers:** I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation stalls:** If the negotiation drags on, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I meet my minimum value. 

This strategy balances my desire for a good price with the need to potentially reach a compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $900,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a safety net:** If I can't get a better deal from Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise between his offer and my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $850,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I earn a profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and acknowledges Bob's perspective. It emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It signals that I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Provides a strong starting point:** $850,000 is a good compromise for both of us. 
* **Keeps the door open for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer again, trying to reach an agreement.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  It's a good deal for both of us and secures a sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer would only be a $25,000 loss compared to my minimum value.
* **Time and risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or a failed deal.
* **John's offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, this would require more effort and time.

**Conclusion:**

Given the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum value, and the potential for a quicker and more certain sale, I've decided to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $825,000."
