,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still above what I can afford. I'm firm on my offer of $8000. If you're unable to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller. ",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
