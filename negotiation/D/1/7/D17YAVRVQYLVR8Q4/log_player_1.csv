Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, but still maintaining a price that's higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price,  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
