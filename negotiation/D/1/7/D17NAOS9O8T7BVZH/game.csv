"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a significant concession from my original offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the value this product brings to the table.",10250.0,Alice,5,
