"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $140. This is my lowest price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $130. This is getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair offer. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I'm counteroffering at $125. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,
