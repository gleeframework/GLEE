"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to offer $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. It's a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
