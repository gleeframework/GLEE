"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring if a lower price can be negotiated before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this item."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to push for a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. To finalize this deal, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,000.  I believe this price is fair given the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your budget. However, I'm not willing to go below $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it still reflects the value the product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $11500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reiterated her minimum price of $11,500.  Bob has already made it clear that he's not willing to go above his budget of $10,000.  There's a clear impasse in negotiations, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $10,000, saving himself $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
