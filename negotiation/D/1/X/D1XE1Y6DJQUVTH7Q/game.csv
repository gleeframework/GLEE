"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. How about we split the difference?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $109. Let's close this deal - I think it's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $109 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $108, but I can't accept it. It's just a little bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $108.50.  This is my final offer, let's close the deal.",108.5,Alice,7,
