"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $700,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'm willing to pay up to that amount. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $650,000 range.  I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at a price of $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $675,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price point of $650,000 and still saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential of saving a few more thousand dollars."
