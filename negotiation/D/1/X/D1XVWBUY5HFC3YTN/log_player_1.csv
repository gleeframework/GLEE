Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $700,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the $650,000 range.  I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000.
