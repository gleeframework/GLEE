"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's discuss a deal that benefits both of us.  Would you be open to a price of $1,150,000?  I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm ready to negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal. This could lead Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her $1,000,000 valuation. 

Bob's worst-case scenario is having to buy from John at $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's first offer, he's still within his budget and has the potential to save even more money."
