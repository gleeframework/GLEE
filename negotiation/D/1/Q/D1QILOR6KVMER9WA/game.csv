"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's discuss a deal that benefits both of us.  Would you be open to a price of $1,150,000?  I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm ready to negotiate further if needed.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
