"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for to someone else.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm hoping we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,,
