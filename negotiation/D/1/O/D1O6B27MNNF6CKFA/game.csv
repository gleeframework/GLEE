"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000? It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice. While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price that meets both of us closer to the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? It's a fair price that still gives me some room for profit.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to move up a bit more to show I'm serious. How about $12,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my minimum price of $15,000. How about $13,750? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",13750.0,Alice,7,
