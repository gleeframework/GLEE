Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for coming down, Alice. While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price that meets both of us closer to the middle.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
