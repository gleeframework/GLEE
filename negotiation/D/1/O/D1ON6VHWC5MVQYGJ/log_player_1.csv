"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Value proposition:** I'm subtly implying that the product has value and benefits that Bob will appreciate. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving and potentially reach an agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Although $110 is tempting, I'm not desperate to sell. There's still a chance that I can get a better price with more negotiation or from John.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for the value you'll get. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm making a final offer that's only $5 above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Finality:** I'm using phrases like ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price that is acceptable to both parties and close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer, I'm still looking for a better deal. Would you consider $110? It's a fair price and allows us both to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** With only four rounds left, the negotiation window is closing.
* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer is at my minimum, and it's unlikely he will budge further.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John than to risk a further rejection from Bob and potentially end up with no sale at all."
