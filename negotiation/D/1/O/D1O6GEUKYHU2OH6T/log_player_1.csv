Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and negotiate. This shows flexibility and encourages further dialogue.

**Note:** This is just a starting point.  The optimal strategy will depend on Bob's responses and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? It's still a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room for me to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my initial offer of $10,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup option, which gives me the security to be firm in my negotiations with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I want to see if I can push Bob further. I'm confident that he values the product enough to potentially increase his offer.

**Next Move:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $9,500? That's still a significant savings for you, and it allows me to get a fairer price for the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that $9,500 is still a great deal considering he values the product at $12,000.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a quick decision from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'm keeping my options open. If Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, I'll carefully consider if I should:

* **Counter Offer Again:** I could make another counteroffer, potentially offering a slightly lower price.
* **Accept Bob's Offer:** If Bob refuses to budge, I might accept his offer of $9,000, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I'll proceed with selling the product to John for $8,000, ensuring I still make a profit."
