Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the value to Bob to make the offer more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, allowing us to explore a potential deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,200,000 is enticing, it's important to remember that selling to Bob now could still be more profitable in the long run if I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers, but I will also be aware of John's offer as my ""fallback"" option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is far below my expectations, it's still a good sign that he's interested.  I can potentially use this to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum. I'll need to carefully consider how high I can go while still making a profit and remaining competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value you've placed on the product and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I reiterate the value Bob places on the product to reinforce the fairness of the offer. 
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language (""appreciate your interest"", ""willing to compromise"") to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Opportunity to Close:** I frame the offer as a chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  Remember, John is willing to pay $1,200,000, but I'm prioritizing a potential deal with Bob at this point.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  I will be ready to adjust my counteroffer based on Bob's response. I might even be willing to go a bit lower than $800,000 to secure a deal.  However, I will always keep my minimum price of $1,200,000 in mind."
