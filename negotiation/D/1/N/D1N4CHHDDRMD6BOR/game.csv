"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above the number I'm willing to go. I can offer it to you for $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. I'm getting closer to the original price, but I need to make a profit.",11500.0,Alice,5,
