"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
