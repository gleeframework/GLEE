"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($14,000 vs. $8,000). You have 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above your absolute maximum. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, while also setting a clear boundary for your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget and you still have 7 rounds left. You can likely negotiate a better price by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but also demonstrates that you're sticking to your budget.  A $500 increase from your previous offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying below your maximum price. You're also framing it as a fair compromise to increase the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but you're getting closer. You have 5 rounds left and there's still potential to negotiate further.  You should try to counter her offer and see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer signals to Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are sticking to your budget.
* **Small Increase:**  The offer is a $500 increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Framing:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to close the deal at this price,  creating a sense of urgency.

This is a calculated risk. You're pushing the limits of your budget, but if Alice rejects, you still have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope you can accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your budget, you are nearing the end of your rounds. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000. You've already shown Alice you're serious about negotiating and even though you could potentially get a slightly better price in the next couple rounds, it's not worth the risk of a stalemate.  You've successfully negotiated the price down, and now you can secure the product for a good price with John."
