"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a deal. ",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope you can accept it.",10250.0,Alice,7,
