"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000, and I believe that's a fair price considering what I'm getting.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
