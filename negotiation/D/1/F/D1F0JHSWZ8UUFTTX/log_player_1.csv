{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 offer:**  This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  This helps build rapport and keeps the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

This offer allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum than Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, but I have a backup plan (selling to John) if it doesn't work out.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider:

* **Reducing the price slightly:**  I might offer a lower price, but not too low to avoid losing too much.
* **Making a counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer to try and meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Moving on to John:**  If Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable or the negotiation drags on, I'll switch to selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can make a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and can walk away if necessary.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully consider my counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum, but also acknowledges Bob's interest in the product.  If the negotiation stalls or Bob continues to offer low prices, I will move to selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $12,500:** This is a compromise between my minimum of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. It's a significant price reduction, but still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** This helps maintain a good rapport and encourages further negotiation.
* **Focus on value and compromise:**  I emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate to find a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Test the waters:**  It gauges Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that's too low.
* **Stay within my range:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price.

**Next steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the price slightly:**  I might offer a lower price, but not too low to avoid losing too much.
* **Making a final counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffers are still too low, I'll make a final counteroffer and be prepared to walk away if necessary.
* **Moving on to John:**  If the negotiation stalls or Bob continues to offer low prices, I will sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, accepting it would still result in a significant financial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. This allows me to:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can make a final counteroffer, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and can walk away if necessary.

**Next steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that's close to my minimum, but also acknowledges Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I will move to selling to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a great price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer of $13,000:** This is a final compromise, significantly closer to my minimum of $15,000, but still above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Emphasize Finality:** The message clearly states this is my final offer, adding pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Reiterate Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth strengthens my position. 
* **Threat of Moving On:**  This is a subtle but necessary reminder that I have alternative options.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer allows me to:

* **Maintain Control:**  By making this final offer, I control the negotiation and can walk away if necessary.
* **Prepare for a Decision:** I'm ready to either sell to Bob or move on to John, depending on his response.

**Next steps:**

I'll await Bob's response.  If he rejects my offer, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000. If he accepts, I'll finalize the transaction and move on."
