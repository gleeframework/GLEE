Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable paying $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the gap between his valuation and mine is still significant. It's unlikely he'll come close enough to my $1,000,000 valuation to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
