"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While my maximum is $10,000, I want to start significantly lower to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I acknowledge Alice's offer but clearly state it's not acceptable. Offering a specific price shows I'm serious.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a considerable gap between $8,000 and Alice's $18,000. This allows for back-and-forth negotiation. I'm prepared to increase my offer gradually, but I always have John's $10,000 offer as my fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $12,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved considerably from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $12,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer. I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do any better, perhaps closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Clear:** I'm now stating my maximum price directly. This signals to Alice that I'm serious about this budget and unlikely to go higher.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  While firm, I'm still using appreciative language to keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Pressure Point:**  By presenting my maximum, I'm putting a bit of pressure on Alice. She now has to decide if she'd rather make a deal at my price or risk losing the sale altogether (since I have John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get close to your target, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $14,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has barely budged from her previous offer and is still significantly above my $10,000 limit.  It's clear she's not willing to come down to a price that works for me.  At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. I'm better off taking John's offer and securing the product at my target price."
