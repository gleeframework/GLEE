"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is quite a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $12,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you do any better, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get close to your target, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $14,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do.",14000.0,Alice,5,
