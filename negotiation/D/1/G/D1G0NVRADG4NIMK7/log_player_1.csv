Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I have a more realistic budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds significant value, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to invest in this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's highly unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. Accepting $800,000 would mean a loss of $400,000 compared to John's offer.  Therefore, the most profitable decision is to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
