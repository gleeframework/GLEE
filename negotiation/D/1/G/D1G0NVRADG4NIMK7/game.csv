"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I have a more realistic budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,350,000? This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still quite far from what I had in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects my genuine interest while acknowledging the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While I aim for a deal that benefits both of us, $750,000 undervalues the product's potential.  To move towards a close, would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds significant value, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to invest in this purchase.",800000.0,Bob,6,
