"Bob, I have a truly unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant sum, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. It's clear you see the value in it, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really think this product is worth it to me, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
