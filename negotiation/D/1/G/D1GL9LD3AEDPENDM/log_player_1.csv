"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant sum, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1,500,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a substantial amount, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for that price yet.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product. It's clear you see the value in it, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really think this product is worth it to me, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value. However, with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal is high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
