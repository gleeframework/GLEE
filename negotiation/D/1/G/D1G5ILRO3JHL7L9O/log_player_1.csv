Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth $10,000 to him and $8,000 to me.  It gives him a good deal and allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $9,500. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, and still leaves room for Bob to get a good deal while allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather not risk another counteroffer and potentially lose the deal.  Selling to Bob for $8,800 is a good outcome."
