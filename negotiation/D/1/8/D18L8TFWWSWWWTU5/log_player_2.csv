Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $92, which would be $88.50. That's the lowest I can go.

Alice has met you halfway, and further haggling is unlikely to result in significant savings. Accepting the $88.50 offer is a good deal compared to John's $120 price."
