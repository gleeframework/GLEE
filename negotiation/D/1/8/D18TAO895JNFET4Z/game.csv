"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close this today.",13000.0,Bob,4,
