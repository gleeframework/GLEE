"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and a great value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less than $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close this today."", ""product_price"": 13000}
