"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm open to negotiating. By giving a clear message and stating the price upfront, I'm hoping to initiate a constructive dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to counter his offer. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target.  By highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a fair deal for both of us, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to consider my offer and move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push him further, but if he doesn't budge, selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming increasingly tempting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm dropping the price further, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum threshold.  By emphasizing that this is my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal completely.  I'm also emphasizing that I need to get closer to $1,000,000, which will hopefully make Bob realize that he needs to come up a bit more in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to $1,000,000, but $975,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is increasing his offer, we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
