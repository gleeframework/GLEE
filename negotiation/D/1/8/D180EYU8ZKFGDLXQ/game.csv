"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
