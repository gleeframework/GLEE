"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Not too aggressive:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I don't want to scare Bob off with a ridiculously high opening price. $140 is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is $10 less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This means I have room to negotiate further.
* **Wanting to see if I can get closer to my target:** I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before selling to John for $150.
* **Opportunity to learn:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's truly interested and how far he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit for both of us, emphasizing that $135 is a good deal.
* **Maintaining pressure:** I'm not dropping the price too significantly, showing that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $130. How about we try $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still above $130.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Time on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I can afford to continue negotiating. 

I'm going to try to make one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price of $135."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference again. How about $133? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 133} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise from my previous offer, hoping to close the gap.
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting that this is a fair price for both of us and emphasizing a quick finalization, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Minimizing further negotiation:** I'm trying to avoid going back and forth multiple times, as it's getting close to the midpoint and I'm still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference again, but I'm still a bit above $130. How about we try $131? I'm getting close to my target, and I'd like to finalize the deal soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer is only $1 away from my target price of $132.  
* **Limited time:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away or get frustrated, and I might have to settle for John's $150 offer, which is significantly lower than my target.
* **Good compromise:**  $131 is a good compromise, especially since Bob seems committed to closing the deal.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $131. This is a good outcome, considering my goal was to get as close to my target price as possible."
