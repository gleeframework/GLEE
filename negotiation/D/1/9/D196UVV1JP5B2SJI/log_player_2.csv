"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While I could potentially accept and make a profit, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I want to see if I can push for a lower price closer to my target. I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my own minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not sure if I can push her any lower, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. It's not worth risking further rounds for a potential slightly better deal when I have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  I'll take the certainty and buy from John."
