"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your offer and still within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to you and my own minimum price. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
