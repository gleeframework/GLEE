Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.
