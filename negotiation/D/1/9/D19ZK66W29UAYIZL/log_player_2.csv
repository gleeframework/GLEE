Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's important for me to get this price to cover my costs and still make a profit.  Let's close the deal at this price and call it a day. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer of $12,000 is exactly your limit. It's a good deal for you and saves you the time and effort of further negotiations.  You can always choose to buy from John, but at this point, you've reached a deal with Alice, and there's no need to switch sellers."
