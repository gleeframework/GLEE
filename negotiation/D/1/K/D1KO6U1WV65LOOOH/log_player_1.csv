"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a higher price than $150, so I will reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  While $150 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $175? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $175 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to pay $155 for it. Can you meet me in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $155 is getting closer to my minimum of $150 and it's better than what John is offering.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid risking losing out on the sale completely."
