"I appreciate your interest, Bob!  While $150 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $175? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",175.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not convinced that $175 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to pay $155 for it. Can you meet me in the middle again?,155.0,Bob,4,
