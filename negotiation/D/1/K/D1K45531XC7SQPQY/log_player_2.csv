**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice has been steadily coming down and meeting us closer to the middle.  $825,000 represents a significant savings from both her initial offer and John's fallback price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a much better outcome, and we risk Alice becoming firmer in her position."
