"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  Could we settle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $675,000.  Would that be acceptable?",675000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $675,000, which would be $687,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",687500.0,Alice,7,
