"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more to Bob than he initially thinks.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and negotiation style. His response will give me valuable information for subsequent rounds.
* **John as Leverage:** I have the security of John's offer, meaning I'm not desperate to close a deal below my minimum. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now.  I could do $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his stated value of $1,000,000, indicating he's willing to negotiate and likely sees more value in the product than he initially let on. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a significant gap between his offer and both my minimum ($1,500,000) and my initial ask ($2,000,000). Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me space to work towards a more favorable price.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer because I have John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is substantial. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm making a significant concession to show willingness to negotiate. Moving down $250,000 from my initial ask demonstrates flexibility.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,750,000 counteroffer is still comfortably above both my minimum price and Bob's initial offer. It keeps me in a strong position to work towards a favorable deal.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me understand how much Bob is truly willing to pay and how he responds to my negotiating tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It seems like we're getting closer, Alice.  How about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  
* **Strong Offer:** While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, this is already a very good offer, and there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now means securing a significant profit without the risk of the negotiation continuing and potentially breaking down."
