{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** This price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I'm open to discussion and willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a suboptimal offer from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore further negotiation possibilities with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest in my product, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $975,000 to demonstrate my flexibility, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering at $975,000, a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, indicating that I'm serious about getting close to my desired price.
* **Flexibility:** By mentioning my willingness to compromise, I'm showcasing flexibility, which could encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still hold the advantage since I can walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still committed to keeping my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $960,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still a significant loss for me.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could drag on, potentially costing me time and ultimately leading to a lower price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a secure outcome. 

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision at this point. I'm willing to sacrifice a slightly higher price for the certainty of a guaranteed sale and the time saved from further negotiations."
