Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $1,300,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but still leaves a substantial profit for me. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and straightforward, highlighting the value to Bob while also being open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** This initial offer is high, but I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The difference between my minimum value and the initial offer allows for some give and take.
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed alternative buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm not afraid to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000 and much lower than the initial offer I made.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and ensuring the deal doesn't fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows you to make a significant return on your investment, while also giving me a fair return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message remains polite and acknowledges Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the potential value of the product for him.
* **Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's low offer and making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed alternative buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000.  There's no reason for me to settle for a price that is significantly lower than that.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll sell the product to John and avoid any further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not acceptable for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and if you're unable to accept it, I will have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  $1,050,000 is a compromise that reflects Bob's willingness to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* **Message:** This message is firm but still respectful. It clearly states that this is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll move on.
* **Deadline:** The message subtly creates a sense of urgency, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By setting a clear deadline and demonstrating my willingness to walk away, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a reasonable price from Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll confidently move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
