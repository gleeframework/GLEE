"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $7,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,100 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal. ",7100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $7,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.
