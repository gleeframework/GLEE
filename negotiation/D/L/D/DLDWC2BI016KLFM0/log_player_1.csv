Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, signaling that I'm open to a counteroffer.

This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I won't accept anything less than $120.
* **John is a secure backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to hold out for a better deal. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I can likely get a higher price from Bob than his current offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within range:**  $92.50 is closer to my desired price point of $120, but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using positive language to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal with Bob without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is becoming unproductive:**  Bob is not willing to budge significantly, and further rounds of negotiation might be time-consuming and frustrating.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price without any risk or further negotiation.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the current situation makes selling to John the most logical and profitable decision."
