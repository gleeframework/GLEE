Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  $8,000 is too low.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $9,000. It's a good compromise and I'm confident I can find a similar buyer in the future if I need to."
