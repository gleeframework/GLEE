"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
