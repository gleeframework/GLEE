"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is starting high at $12,000. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) to give myself room to negotiate upward. 
* **Polite and Open:** My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's initial offer. I want to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving a significant gap between my offer and Alice's to allow for back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my desired price range, I'm still above my backup option with John ($10,000).  There's still room to negotiate, especially since she's eager to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $9,750? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to move, but not by much. 
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm using language like ""fair compromise"" to signal I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me below my maximum price with John, giving me a bit more negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,000 is my final offer.  This price is fair for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our bottom line.  There's no point in rejecting her offer and risking her walking away, as we can't get a better price from John."
