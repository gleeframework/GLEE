Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, acknowledging that we might need to adjust the price. 
* **Knowing my fallback:** I'm aware I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate and can walk away if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $10,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to push for a higher price, potentially closer to my initial offer of $14,000.

I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive:** I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the fairness of the offer. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a final price, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Back-up plan:** I'm still aware of my fallback option with John, which gives me confidence in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I still think I can do better. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer again, I risk pushing him away completely. He might decide to walk away and find another seller, leaving me with John as my only option.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially lead to a lower offer or even the loss of the deal. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a price that's significantly higher than selling to John. 

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable option to secure a sale and maximize my profit at this stage."
