"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product's value to me is higher than $750,000. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $790,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",790000.0,Bob,6,
