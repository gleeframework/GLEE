"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and recognizes the value of the product. Let's come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a final offer that takes into account the value I see in the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
