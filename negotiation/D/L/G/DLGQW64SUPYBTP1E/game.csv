,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $9,500 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about $10,500?  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10250.0,Bob,6,
