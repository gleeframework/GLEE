{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which encourages Bob to counter-offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me the confidence to push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest. I can still negotiate upwards with him. 
* **John is the backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more, and I'm confident you won't regret it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make my offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Leveraging John:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. Knowing John is waiting gives me confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Leveraging John:**  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my full price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation is getting a bit drawn out, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and sell to John to secure my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $9,500 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about $10,500?  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value and price:**  I'm again emphasizing the quality of the product and how this price is still a good deal for something worth more.
* **Setting a deadline:** By stating ""this is the best I can do,"" I subtly create a sense of urgency and finality. This could encourage Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept. This gives me confidence to stand my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,250. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $10,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm likely not going to get a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Time and Effort:** The negotiation has gone on for a while, and it's getting tiring.
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $15,000, which is worth the time saved in continuing the negotiation. 

I've decided to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed higher price."
