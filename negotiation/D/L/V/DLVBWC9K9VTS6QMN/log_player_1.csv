{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if I can get a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $15,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13,500, which was $1,000 less than your current offer. I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm getting concerned that we are not going to reach an agreement, and I'm getting close to the end of my rounds.  I'm going to sell to John to avoid losing a guaranteed $15,000."
