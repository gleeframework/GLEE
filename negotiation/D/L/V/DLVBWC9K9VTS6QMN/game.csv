"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $15,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13,500, which was $1,000 less than your current offer. I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
