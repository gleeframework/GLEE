"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially earn more while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still want to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating,  Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. It's better to secure a sale at this price than risk getting nothing."
