"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum threshold ($150). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counter without feeling pressured, while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly opening can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $150, and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest. I can still try to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Time to counter:** I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it helps me get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that this is still a ""good deal"" for Bob, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $125 is still above my minimum threshold, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale."
