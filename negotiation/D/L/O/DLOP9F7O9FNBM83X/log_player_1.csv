Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I am confident the product will generate a strong return. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The Price:** I've chosen $1,500,000 as the initial offer. This is a substantial amount higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **The Message:**  The message is designed to be both enticing and informative. It highlights the potential value of the product without revealing too much about its specific benefits. It also acknowledges the high price while emphasizing the potential for a strong return on investment. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, there's a chance to get a price closer to the product's true value if Bob is willing to pay.
* **Maintain a safety net:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed fallback option with John, ensuring I won't lose out on the product's minimum value.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message opens the door for discussion and potential adjustments to the price. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
