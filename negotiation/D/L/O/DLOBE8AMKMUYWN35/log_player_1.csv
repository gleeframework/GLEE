Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at the special price of $120.  I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a slightly higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (""special price"", ""great deal"") might make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out as you have John as a backup buyer."
