"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  This gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate, and I'm confident I can still get a good price.  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.  This also leaves room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,125,000 is a good deal, especially considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for a stalemate.  I'm also considering the time factor and the fact that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
