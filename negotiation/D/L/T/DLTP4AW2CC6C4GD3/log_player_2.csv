It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is. A lower price will hopefully encourage her to negotiate further."

$700,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems stuck on her price. We've gone back and forth several times, and it's looking like she won't budge much further. At this point, it's more sensible to buy from John for $1,000,000 than to continue the negotiation. The risk of further rejection is high, and the potential savings aren't worth the time and effort."
