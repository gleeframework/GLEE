"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Is there any room to negotiate?  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That way we're both getting a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
