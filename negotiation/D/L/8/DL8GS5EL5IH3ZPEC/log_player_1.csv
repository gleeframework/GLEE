"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows Bob to see the value of the product without immediately rejecting the offer.  I'll keep an eye on the value of the product to John ($1,500,000) as a baseline for accepting counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,800,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $1,700,000 is a good price, especially considering we're only on round 4. It's above my minimum threshold, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
