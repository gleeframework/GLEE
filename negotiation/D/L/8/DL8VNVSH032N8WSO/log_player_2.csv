"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $85, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum price. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in accepting an offer above that."
