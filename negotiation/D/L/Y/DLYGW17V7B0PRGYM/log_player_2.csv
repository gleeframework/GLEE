"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get it for a little less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:** I'm starting with an aggressive counteroffer at Alice's value ($100). The goal is to maximize my savings, and there's a chance Alice might accept to avoid losing the sale.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  Even though it's a low offer, the tone remains polite and suggests I'm genuinely interested.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This leaves room for further negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my price until we reach a mutually agreeable point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and while $112.50 is better than her initial offer, I think there's still room to haggle. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to her revised figure to signal my interest while aiming for further savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  What if we settled on $105? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer ($100) and her counteroffer ($112.50). This shows a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Close to Target:** At $105, I'm getting closer to my target of maximizing savings while still staying within my budget. 
* **Maintaining Interest:**  The tone remains positive, emphasizing fairness and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
