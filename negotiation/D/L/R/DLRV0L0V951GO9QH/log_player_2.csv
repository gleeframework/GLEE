Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds (only 3 left).
