"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and John is selling the product for $150, there's no point in negotiating with Alice.  It's guaranteed that John will sell the product at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.  There's no potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."
