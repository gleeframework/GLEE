Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than what John is offering, and it's a fair compromise considering her initial offer. I'm going to accept and save myself some money."
