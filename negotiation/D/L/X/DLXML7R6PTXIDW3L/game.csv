"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to acquire the product for a slightly lower price. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
