"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to offer $13,500. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
