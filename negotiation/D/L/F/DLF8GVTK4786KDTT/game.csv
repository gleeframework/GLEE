"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,250, which would be $7,875. Can you consider that price?",7875.0,Bob,4,
