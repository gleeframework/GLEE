**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to meet above the $825,000 mark.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance we won't be able to bridge the gap significantly. Accepting a lower price means potentially losing out on a substantial amount. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,000,000 value and avoids the risk of further negotiation stalemates."
