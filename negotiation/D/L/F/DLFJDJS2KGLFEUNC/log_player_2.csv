Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a slight improvement from the previous round, $10,500 is still over Bob's target price.  He should continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his desired price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think the product's value to you is higher than $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,250. Can we meet in the middle again?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his desired price, $10,250 is still above his target of $12,000.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. There are still rounds left and he can still try to close a deal closer to his target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $9,750.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a tempting offer, it's still above his desired price point, and there are still rounds left for negotiation.  He can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer or even consider buying from John if the negotiations don't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,875. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is worth $1,000. So, the effective price would be $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is the best deal he's gotten so far.  Even though he's technically paying $9,000, the added value of the warranty and maintenance package makes this a good deal for him.  He's closing in on his desired price range, and the extra perks make it worthwhile to close the deal."
