,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think the product's value to you is higher than $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $10,250. Can we meet in the middle again?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  Let's try to meet in the middle again. If we can close the deal at this price, I'll be happy to move forward with the purchase.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,875. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",9875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is worth $1,000. So, the effective price would be $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
