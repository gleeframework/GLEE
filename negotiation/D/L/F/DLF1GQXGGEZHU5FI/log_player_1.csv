{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) risks insulting him and might make him less likely to engage. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before having to go with John's guaranteed offer."
