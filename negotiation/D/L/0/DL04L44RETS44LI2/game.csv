"I understand your perspective on the market value of similar products, but I'm afraid I have to consider the unique features and benefits of this specific product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
