"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $700,000 is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $850,000. This reflects a significant discount and gives you a good deal while still allowing me to reach my minimum. Let's work together to finalize this.",850000.0,Alice,3,
