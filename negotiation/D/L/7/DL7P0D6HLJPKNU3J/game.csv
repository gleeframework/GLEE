"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more. How about we try $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like.  Could we consider $1,175,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,250,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worthwhile. I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
