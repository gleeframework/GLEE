"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. That's a good deal for both of us, what do you say?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's my top price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,375. That's my best and final offer.",12375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're set on $12,375, but that's still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $12,625. That's a fair price for both of us and will get this deal done. Let's shake hands on it!",12625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,625. Let's try $12,312.50. That's my final offer.",12312.5,Bob,6,
