Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth $15,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $13,500. That's a good deal for both of us, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's my top price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price of $13,500. Bob is clearly interested, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,375. That's my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my ideal price of $13,500. Bob's offer is only $375 more than what John is offering, and it's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $12,375, but that's still a little below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference? I'll accept $12,625. That's a fair price for both of us and will get this deal done. Let's shake hands on it!"", ""product_price"": 12625}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,625. Let's try $12,312.50. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,312.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,312.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his price, and I'm not comfortable dropping any further.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to convince him to go higher. John is offering me my minimum, so it's time to cut my losses and secure the deal."
