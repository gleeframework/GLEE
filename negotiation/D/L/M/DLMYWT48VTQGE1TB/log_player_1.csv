Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price far below the product's value and my minimum. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
