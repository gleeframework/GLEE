Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also a strong starting point, as it's still lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  We'll see if Bob is willing to pay this much, or if we need to adjust our strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my target price and still well above my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and secures a good profit."
