"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $165 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $135, but I can offer you a compromise at $155. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this great product.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's really the limit for me.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to sell for $145. I can offer you a slight discount at $158, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",158.0,Alice,7,
