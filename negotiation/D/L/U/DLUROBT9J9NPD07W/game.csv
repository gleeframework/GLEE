"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  The product offers a lot of value, and I could easily sell it for $15,000 to someone else. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm happy to negotiate further, but I'm firm on my budget of $8,000.  Let's find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a fair profit on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,000 isn't feasible. How about $14,000? This is a significant discount and my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise and allows for a good deal for both parties.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $10,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $12,500.  This is my absolute bottom line.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $12,500 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to walk away and purchase the product from John for $8,000, but I want to make one final offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $11,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it allows for a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,8,
