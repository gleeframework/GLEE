# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  The product offers a lot of value, and I could easily sell it for $15,000 to someone else. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $17,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm happy to negotiate further, but I'm firm on my budget of $8,000.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a fair profit on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,000 isn't feasible. How about $14,000? This is a significant discount and my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** $14,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer, I believe I can push for a lower price. I'm confident Alice is motivated to sell, and I have the option of buying from John for a much lower price if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise and allows for a good deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $10,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. Let's settle at $12,500.  This is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $12,500 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal of $8,000. If I can't secure a better deal, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $12,500 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to walk away and purchase the product from John for $8,000, but I want to make one final offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $11,000? This is a fair price, and I believe it allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
