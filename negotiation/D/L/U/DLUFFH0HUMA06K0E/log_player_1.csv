Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our own $12,000 minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves space for potential counter-offers, bringing the final price closer to his $10,000 valuation.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While we have John as a backup, a sale to Bob is preferable as it avoids potential delays or complications involved with a second transaction. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a quick and profitable sale with Bob while ensuring we don't undervalue the product if he rejects the offer."
