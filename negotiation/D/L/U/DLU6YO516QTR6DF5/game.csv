"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $12,000, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  Honestly, though, at this price point, I'm very close to just going with another seller who offered me $15,000.  If you can do $9,500, I'm ready to close the deal right now.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make it happen if you're willing to meet me here.",10000.0,Alice,7,
