"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $180.  This is significantly higher than your desired price. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $155. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, so I'm offering it to you for $147.50. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $147.50 is still higher than your budget. While it's closer to your desired price, it's not worth continuing the negotiation since you can get the same product from John for $120."
