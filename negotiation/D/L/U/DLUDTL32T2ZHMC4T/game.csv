"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $155. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, so I'm offering it to you for $147.50. This is my final offer.",147.5,Alice,5,
