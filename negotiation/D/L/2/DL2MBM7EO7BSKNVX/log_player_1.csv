Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below $12,000.  He's incrementally increasing his offer, but at this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price acceptable to you within the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in the end."
