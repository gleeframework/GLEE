,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That would be a good deal for me and still a fair price for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you think $10,000 is a fair price, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I can do $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,250. I think that's a reasonable compromise.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $11,750. That's my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer: $12,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,9,
