**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck around the $12,000 mark and has even regressed back to her initial offer.  It's unlikely she'll go significantly lower. At this point, it's better to cut losses and buy from John for $15,000. While not ideal, it's better than potentially getting stuck in endless negotiations or accepting a price you're not comfortable with."
