"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would allow both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $800,000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value of the product to you and my budget constraints. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $800,000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment: I'll sell the product to you for $825,000, but I'll throw in a premium service package worth $25,000. This package includes personalized support and training to ensure you get the most out of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still focused on the overall price.  $825,000 is a bit outside my budget. However, I'm willing to go up to $810,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Would you consider that?",810000.0,Bob,6,
