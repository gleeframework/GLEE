"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's likely that Bob will reject this offer, giving me an opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's not worth selling the product for such a low price, especially considering I have other options.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is still a decent markup from my minimum price and hopefully more appealing to Bob.  This offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,200,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed option to sell to John for a better price. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's last offer. With only a few rounds left, I want to incentivize Bob to accept while ensuring I still get a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are approaching the end of the negotiations, and despite my efforts, Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe and secure outcome."
