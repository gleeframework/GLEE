"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point and leave room for negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower than that."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, as it's very close to my minimum acceptable price."
