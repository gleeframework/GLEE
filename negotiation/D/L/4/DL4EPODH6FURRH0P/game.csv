"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm not able to disclose specifics at this time, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time opportunity. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1000000. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
