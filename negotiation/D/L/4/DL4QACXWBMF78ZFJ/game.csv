"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move things forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope it aligns better with your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $1,225,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant price reduction on my end and reflects my desire to make a deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I respect your position.  To be honest, John has offered me the same product for $1,000,000. To keep our deal alive, I'd need you to come down to that price.  If you can't, I'll need to consider his offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
