"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's close this deal quickly!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is good, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's try to make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I value your willingness to negotiate,  $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,187,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are getting very close to a deal. I understand you are aiming for a specific price point, but I cannot go lower than $1,175,000. It's a fair compromise considering both our positions, and I truly believe it's a great deal for you. Let's finalize this transaction.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
