Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also emphasizes the product's perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:** The message subtly reminds Bob that he's not the only interested party, potentially encouraging a quicker decision.

By starting at $950,000, I'm aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room to potentially close the deal with Bob."
