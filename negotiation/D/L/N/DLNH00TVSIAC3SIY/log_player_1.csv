I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and this offer gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than his offer and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price, but also willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,350,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above his current offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to settle for much less than my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for,  it's a significant increase from his previous offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to potentially end up with no sale at all."
