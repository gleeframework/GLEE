"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1800000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $1600000. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm still confident that this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1300000. How about we try $1350000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
