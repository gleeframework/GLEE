"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still her valuation, not mine. I'll counter again to try and move closer to my budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair bit closer to my initial offer."",
