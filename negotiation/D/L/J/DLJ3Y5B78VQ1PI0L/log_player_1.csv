Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible *unless* you can convince Bob the product is worth more to him.

**The Strategy**

You need to make Bob believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. This requires focusing on the product's *value* to Bob, not just its price.  Here's how:

1. **Highlight Unique Benefits:** What makes your product uniquely valuable to Bob that might justify exceeding his perceived value?  Does it offer him increased efficiency, market share, or competitive advantages?
2. **Quantify the Value:** Can you put a dollar amount on the benefits Bob will receive? If you can show him how the product will earn him an additional $300,000 in profit, for example, the price becomes more palatable.
3. **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Let Bob know you have other interested buyers (which you do!). This can nudge him to act quickly.

**The Offer**

Since we need more information to truly highlight the product's unique value to Bob, I'll provide a sample offer that focuses on a slightly higher price with a strong call to action:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire [Product Name]. This product isn't just about [mention a basic feature], it's about [highlight a key benefit tailored to Bob's needs/industry]. While I have other interested parties, I believe in giving you the first opportunity. I'm confident it can bring significant value to your operations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Given the potential ROI this product offers, I believe it's a highly competitive offer. Let me know your thoughts, and let's discuss how this product can help you achieve [mention a specific goal of Bob's]."" ,
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Research:** Before sending the offer, gather as much information as you can about Bob, his business, and his needs. This will help you tailor your message for maximum impact.
* **Flexibility:**  Be prepared to negotiate. While John provides a safety net, securing a deal with Bob might be more advantageous if it can be done quickly and efficiently. 
* **Confidence:**  Believe in your product's value! Your confidence will be contagious and make Bob more receptive to your offer."
