,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value you'll get from the product and also allows for a fair profit for me. Let's meet in the middle on this.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle",920000.0,Bob,4,
