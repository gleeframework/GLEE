"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  This price still allows me to recoup my investment and makes the product a worthwhile purchase for you. Let's try to find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
