"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere around $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal, but that price would make it much easier.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum price I need to make a profit. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",8000.0,Alice,5,
