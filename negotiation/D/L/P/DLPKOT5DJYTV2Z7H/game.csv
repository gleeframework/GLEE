"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
