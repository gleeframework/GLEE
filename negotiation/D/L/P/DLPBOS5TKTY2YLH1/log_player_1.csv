"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable than Bob initially thought. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her own minimum.
* **Openness:**  Ending with a willingness to discuss further shows Alice is flexible and open to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it,  which reflects its potential while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below Alice's minimum and even below John's guaranteed offer. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows Alice to counter with a price closer to her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** Alice acknowledges Bob's offer to show she's listening, but firmly states it's too low.
* **Highlight Value:**  Alice reiterates the product's ""true potential and returns,"" subtly reminding Bob of the benefits. 
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  The price drop to $1,300,000 is significant, signaling flexibility, but keeps Alice well above both Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language implies Alice is looking for a compromise, encouraging Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the potential of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting close to John's guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Slow Progress:**  Bob's counteroffers are increasing slowly, suggesting it'll take significant time and effort to reach Alice's desired price range.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further lowballing. Accepting John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, eliminating uncertainty and potential wasted time.

While there's a chance Alice *could* get more money from Bob, the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 outweighs the potential upside at this point."
