,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $120?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
