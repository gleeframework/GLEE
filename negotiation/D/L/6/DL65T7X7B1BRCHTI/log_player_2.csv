Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can find a comparable product for $8,250. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your need to stay within budget and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. In light of your latest offer, I propose a price of $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while being more accessible to your current budgetary constraints. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
