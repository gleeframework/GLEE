I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I think I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $180. This is still above my minimum, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it also signals that I'm not going to drop the price too drastically."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $170."
