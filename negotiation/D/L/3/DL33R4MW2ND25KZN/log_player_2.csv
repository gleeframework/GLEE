"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price still represents a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can go at this time.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows for more back-and-forth to try and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm going to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a very fair offer, and I hope we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but $1,325,000 is still above his maximum of $1,200,000. He has a few more rounds to negotiate, and there's still a chance to get the price down further. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is a very fair compromise and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting closer.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There are only three rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will drop to a price below Bob's budget. It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John at $1,200,000, as this is the best price he can get and avoids further negotiation."
