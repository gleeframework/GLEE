"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to maximize potential profit. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate down from there, and I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$5,000 is too low for me. I need to make a profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than his offer of $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with $6,000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk and keep negotiating, hoping to get a higher price from Bob.  I might be able to get closer to $8,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm dropping the price to $7,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still not close to my target. I'm not ready to sell for that amount.  I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob, hoping we can reach a price closer to my desired value. There are still four rounds left, so I have time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm dropping the price again to $7,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but I still want to try to make a good profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob.  If he still rejects, I might have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my target.  I've already compromised a lot.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the best option to ensure I get at least a decent profit, given the limited time left."
