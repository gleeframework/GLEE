Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally best to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $14,000 is close to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Above Minimum:** This price ensures a profit above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

By starting the negotiation this way, Alice maximizes her potential profit while remaining aware of her alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above Alice's minimum, there's still room for negotiation. Accepting $12,500 would mean leaving $1,500 on the table (based on her initial asking price). By rejecting and countering, Alice can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you have a budget, Bob, but $12,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, Alice subtly reminds Bob why it's worth paying more.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $13,250 keeps the offer above Alice's minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $13,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:**  $13,000 is still a $1,000 profit over Alice's minimum acceptable price and a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting Bob's offer allows Alice to close the deal and move on to other potential opportunities."
