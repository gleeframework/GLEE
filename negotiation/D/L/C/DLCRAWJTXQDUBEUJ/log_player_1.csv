Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob closer to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification of value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider the long-term benefits.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still providing Bob with a (small) incentive to buy from you instead of you going to John."
