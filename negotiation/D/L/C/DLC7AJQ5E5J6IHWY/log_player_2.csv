Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still believe that this product is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $680,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $680,000 offer secures a good price for Bob and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
