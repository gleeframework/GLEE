"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $650,000?  I think that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still believe that this product is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $680,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",680000.0,Alice,5,
