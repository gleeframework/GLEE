"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $8000. I'm willing to consider $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $9500. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet at least $10500 to make it worth my while. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $9500, but that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $2000 value. So, the price is still $10500, but you'll be getting a lot more value for your money. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $10500. My final offer is $9000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
