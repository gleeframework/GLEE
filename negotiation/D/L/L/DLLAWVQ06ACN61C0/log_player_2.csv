"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.**  You're looking to spend no more than $1,500,000 and her offer is $1,400,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.
* **You have a backup option.**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always buy from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and her offer is $1,350,000.
* **You're saving money compared to John's price.**  John is selling the product for $1,500,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves you $150,000. 
* **The negotiation process is getting close to your desired price.**  You've already gotten Alice to lower her price significantly from her initial offer.

While you might be able to negotiate further, the potential savings are small compared to the risk of breaking down the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
