"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a lower price. I have 9 rounds left and can always fall back on John's offer if I'm unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $6,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and allows room for compromise.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my $5,000 target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $6,500 is a good price. It's still within my budget and saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John. It's likely we'll be able to negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds, but there's a risk of Alice walking away entirely or making a counteroffer that is less favorable.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and potentially saving even more later."
