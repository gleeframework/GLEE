Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, as it's the maximum value I see in it. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, the product's inherent value and potential justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise, considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, reflecting a fair compromise based on our individual valuations. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $1,400,000. Accepting his offer means losing out on a potential $100,000 profit. Selling to John guarantees the maximum value for the product without further negotiation risk."
