"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob values the product at $150, so he might be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my ideal, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of slowly decreasing my price, hoping to meet in the middle.  $180 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm optimistic that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely. $170 is a decent profit and still above my minimum, so it's a good outcome for me."
