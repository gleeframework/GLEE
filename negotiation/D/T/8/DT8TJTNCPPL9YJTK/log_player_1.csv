{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $150.
* **It's below John's offer:** You're leaving room to negotiate if Bob rejects.
* **It's close to Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, knowing he can get a good deal. 

By offering a price slightly above your minimum, you leave room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a good price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum and leaves you with very little profit. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price.  You can make a counteroffer to see if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit lower than I can go right now. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Could we possibly agree on $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $125 is still below your ideal price, it's much closer to your minimum. Given that Bob has consistently offered a price close to his maximum value, it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer ensures you sell the product and make a profit, although a smaller one than you initially hoped for."
