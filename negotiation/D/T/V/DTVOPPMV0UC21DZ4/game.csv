"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something nearer to $11,000. Would that price point be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $11,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can do $11,500.  Do you think that works for you?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $13,500. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and your budget.",13500.0,Alice,7,
