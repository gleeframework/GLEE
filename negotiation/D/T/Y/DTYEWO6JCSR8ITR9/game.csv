"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $88, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",88.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $88 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $86?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both try to be flexible.",86.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll meet you in the middle at $89. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!",89.0,Alice,5,
