Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your price, even if it's a simple statement of value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives you leverage. You are not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

This offer aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can gradually decrease the price, ultimately resorting to John's offer if needed."
