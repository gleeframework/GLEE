"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price downward in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $800,000, as that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more realistic price point considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and find a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  While $1,000,000 from John is tempting, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident that I can make a good profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate. There's a good chance that he'll come back with a higher offer in the next round, especially since I've been showing a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,050,000.  This is a very small step down from my previous offer, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and finally accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to worry that we won't be able to reach an agreement before the deadline. To guarantee a sale and a price that's at least my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
