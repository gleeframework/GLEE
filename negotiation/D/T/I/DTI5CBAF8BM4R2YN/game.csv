"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1400000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment. Can you provide me with some information about the product's value, such as its market price, production costs, or any other relevant details? Additionally, I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. If you can provide me with the information I'm asking for, I'm willing to pay $1400000. If not, I'm willing to go up to $1450000. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,6,,

I can tell you that it's a high-end product with unique features that make it valuable to the right buyer. Considering your willingness to meet me at $1450000, I'm willing to compromise further.

"I understand that you can't disclose the product's market price or production costs, but I'm still not convinced that $1550000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1450000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,8,,
