Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the negotiation dynamics:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it can be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $16,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting with a higher offer ($16,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message doesn't present the $16,000 as an absolute final price. The phrase ""we can discuss further"" invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Focusing on Value, Not Just Price:**  Alice briefly mentions her belief in the product's value to Bob. This framing attempts to steer the conversation towards the benefits Bob gains, potentially making him more receptive to a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic.
* **Market Context:** If this is a hot market where similar products are selling quickly above $12,000, Alice could push for an even higher price."
