Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,500 is above your $12,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you feeling like you're giving away too much. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're stating your price and expressing confidence in its fairness.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer or make a counteroffer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial price.  You can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. You'll need to weigh the risk of rejecting Bob's offer against the potential for a higher price and the time involved in negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit as well. How about $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially try to push for a higher price, Bob has made it clear that $13,000 is his final offer.  Accepting this offer allows you to close the deal and make a decent profit.  Selling to John would only yield $12,000, and further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and uncertain."
