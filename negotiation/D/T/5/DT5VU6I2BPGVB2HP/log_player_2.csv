"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He can do better than $1,200,000. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice. This gives him room to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers and try to get a lower price.  He's still far above Alice's minimum price and has room to negotiate.  He should continue to counteroffer and work toward a price closer to $1,100,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to counteroffer at $1,225,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers. While $1,225,000 is closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate and time to get an even lower price. He can counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap between their positions.  He's still far away from Alice's minimum price, so he can be more aggressive with his counteroffers without risking the deal falling apart."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though this is the seventh round, Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  He knows he can get a better price, and he still has some room to negotiate. He should continue to counteroffer with a price closer to $1,175,000. It's important to remember that Bob is not in a rush and can always walk away and buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go his way."

Round 8

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $1,200,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,190,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value to both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1190000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offers. While $1,210,000 is getting closer to his desired price, there is still room for negotiation, and he has only one round left. He should counteroffer with a price closer to $1,190,000.  He can afford to be a bit more aggressive as he's in a good negotiating position. If this final counteroffer fails, he can always choose to buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, this is our final round.  I'm willing to pay $1,195,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  I hope we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to take my business elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1195000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is Bob's last round, so he needs to make a final push.
* **Close the Gap:** $1,195,000 is close enough to Alice's last offer to potentially tempt her. 
* **Plan B:** Bob has the option to buy from John, so he's not desperate and can walk away if Alice doesn't accept. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is firm but polite, leaving Alice aware of Bob's finality."
