"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while leaving you with a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,075,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
