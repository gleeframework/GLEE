"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the maximum I know Bob is willing to pay ($15,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and positive message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:**  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still less than my ideal profit margin. 
* **Negotiating position:**  Rejecting allows me to maintain a negotiating position and potentially get a better offer.
* **Avoiding John:** I want to maximize my profit and avoid selling to John at a lower price.
* **Potential for counter-offer:** I believe I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value and potential benefits for his business can encourage acceptance.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go lower than $13,000, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it's worth the investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $12,500 is just slightly below my minimum desired price, but it's still a good deal considering the potential for negotiation to fail. 
* **Avoiding further risk:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a deadlock, and I'd risk selling to John for a significantly lower price.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this deal isn't ideal, building a relationship with Bob could lead to future sales where I could potentially achieve a higher price."
