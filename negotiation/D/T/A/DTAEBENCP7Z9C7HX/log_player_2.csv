# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. You can save $1,500 by going with John."
