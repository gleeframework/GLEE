Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to Bob, but I'm open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm going to reject it and counter. I believe the product is worth more than $900,000 to Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my initial asking price and shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $920,000.  While it's not my initial asking price, it's a good deal and much better than selling to John for $800,000.  There's a chance Bob could offer more, but I'm happy with this outcome and don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
