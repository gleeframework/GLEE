Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $150, offering it at $175 gives him a reason to consider it. It's unlikely he'd accept a price much higher than his own valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring you'll at least get your minimum price. This knowledge empowers you to aim a bit higher with Bob."
