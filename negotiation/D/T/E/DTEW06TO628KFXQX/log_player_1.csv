"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm confident it's worth at least $150 to you.  I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but still gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm opening with a friendly message and highlighting the value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not immediately going for the highest possible price, allowing space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $140. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $130 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm not in a rush to accept. 
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price, potentially closer to my initial offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I know I can sell to John for $100, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $135? That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm reducing the risk of a stalemate and increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. I'm willing to meet you at $132. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my target price of $135.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a risk of further negotiation stalling, and I might end up with a lower price or have to sell to John for a significantly lower amount.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the possibility of getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
