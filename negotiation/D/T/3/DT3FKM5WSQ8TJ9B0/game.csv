"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product offers. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it represents a good deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This is a very fair price, considering the product's value to you. I believe we can reach an agreement if we both show a little flexibility.",800000.0,Alice,5,
