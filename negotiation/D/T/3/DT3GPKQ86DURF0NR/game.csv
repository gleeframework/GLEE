"Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I see in this item.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is certainly a significant sum, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while allowing me to realize a significant return on my investment.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
