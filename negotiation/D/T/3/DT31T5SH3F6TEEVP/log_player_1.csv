""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **John as a Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000, acting as your safety net.

**Strategy:**

The offer of $1,400,000 aims to maximize profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** If Bob accepts, you earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Potentially Acceptable to Bob:**  While the price is above Bob's valuation, the message emphasizes the product's ""unique nature"" and ""benefits,""  potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
