"Thanks for the offer Alice!  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
