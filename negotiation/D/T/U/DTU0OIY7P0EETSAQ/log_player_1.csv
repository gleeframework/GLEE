Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $925,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in small increments, and we are still significantly far apart. It's unlikely he'll reach our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit without further negotiation risk."
