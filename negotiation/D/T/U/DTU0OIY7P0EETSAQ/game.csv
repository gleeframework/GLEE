"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the response. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $925,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
