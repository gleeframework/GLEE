"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter.  However, I'm keeping my eye on John as a potential buyer who guarantees my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. I also want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still within a range that's closer to my desired price. This counter shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. It keeps the negotiation going while leaving space for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  $8,800 is still too low. I'm going to counter again, hoping to bridge the gap further. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,200. This is a smaller step down than my previous offer, signaling my continued willingness to negotiate but also my determination to not go lower than my desired value. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations and Bob is still not meeting my minimum. While $8,600 is a respectable offer, I'm concerned I'll get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers with Bob and won't be able to reach my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for my minimum, which will ensure I receive a fair price for my product."
