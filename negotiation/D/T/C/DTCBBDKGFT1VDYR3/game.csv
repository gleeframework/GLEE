"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,750, which would be $8,125. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8125.0,Alice,5,
