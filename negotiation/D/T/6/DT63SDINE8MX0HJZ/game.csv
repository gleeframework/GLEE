"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. I believe it's a great value for you and I'm confident it will be a beneficial asset to your operations.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, considering the potential benefits I see. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  This still allows me to make a profit and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1500000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000. This represents a significant investment on my part and hopefully is a reasonable compromise for you as well.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
