"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, considering the potential benefits I see. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  This still allows me to make a profit and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1500000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1250000. This represents a significant investment on my part and hopefully is a reasonable compromise for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,250,000."
