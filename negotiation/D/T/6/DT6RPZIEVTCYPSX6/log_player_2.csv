"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a chance she accepts, but even if she rejects it, it gives us room to work up to a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice came down to $125, which is a reasonable price and saves us some money compared to John's offer. Let's take it!"
