"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the highest I can go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference - how about $8,875? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, considering the value you place on the product.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,875, which would be $8,437.50. Can you consider that?",8437.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $8,625. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your initial valuation. Let's make this happen.",8625.0,Alice,7,
