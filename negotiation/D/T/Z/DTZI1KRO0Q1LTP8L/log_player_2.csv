"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've done some research and I think it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value this product holds for me. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for her, as it's higher than her value of $800,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $725,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $710,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $720000. This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you the product for $720000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $720,000 is still above your target price of $1,500,000.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, you've already gone through multiple rounds, and Alice has shown a reluctance to go lower.  

It's more efficient to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,500,000. While this is higher than your ideal price, it's still within your budget and avoids potentially prolonged negotiation that might not lead to a better deal."
