{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also sets a positive tone by framing the price as fair, encouraging Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
