Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum possible profit.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The price is still significantly lower than your minimum and offers Bob a good deal compared to its worth to him ($8,000)."
