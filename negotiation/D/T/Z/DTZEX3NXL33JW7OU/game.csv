"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Let's settle this at $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $920,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it.",920000.0,Bob,6,
