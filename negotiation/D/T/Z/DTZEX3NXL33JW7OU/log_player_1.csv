Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet near the product's value.  While we could continue negotiating, his increments are small and unlikely to reach a satisfying amount within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the full value and avoids further negotiation risks."
