"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own costs. Let's see if we can make this work. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm still willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply not a viable option for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
