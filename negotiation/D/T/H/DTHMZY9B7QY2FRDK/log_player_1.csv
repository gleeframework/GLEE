Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 is a price he might be willing to consider.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer still gives you a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.

By offering a lower price initially, you create room for negotiation and potentially increase your chances of a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can get closer to my target price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price that gives you a good deal and me a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. 
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of my offer. This helps to keep the negotiation positive and constructive. 

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $9,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum value of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, accepting his offer allows me to sell the product and avoid the risk of further negotiations.  Since there is a good chance that Bob will not budge further, I believe that accepting this offer is the most rational decision at this point."
