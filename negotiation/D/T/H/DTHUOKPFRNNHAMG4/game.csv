"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget and its true worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $115. Let's see if we can find common ground.",115.0,Bob,2,

"I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to consider $120 as a reasonable price given your budget and the product's value to you. However, to ensure we both feel satisfied, I propose an additional incentive - a complimentary accessory that matches well with the product. Would you consider this a fair deal?",120.0,Alice,5,
