"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,200,000, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is certainly a lower price, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, while also acknowledging the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
