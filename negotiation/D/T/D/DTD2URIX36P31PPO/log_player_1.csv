Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for Bob to counter with his own price, starting the negotiation."
