Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price of $100. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $120. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and still leaving me with a profit margin. I believe this price is fair and could potentially be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. Bob has made it clear that he is not willing to go above $100, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
