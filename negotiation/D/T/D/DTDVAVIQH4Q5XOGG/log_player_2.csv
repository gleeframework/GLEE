"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are aiming to spend no more than $800,000.  
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** Since you have a backup option (buying from John), rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, you're still aiming for $800,000. 
* **Continuing negotiation is worthwhile.** There's a possibility of getting Alice to come down further. Since you can still buy from John, there's no immediate pressure to accept."
