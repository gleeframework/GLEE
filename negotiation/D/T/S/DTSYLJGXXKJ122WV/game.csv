"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $700000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  Let's make a final push. I'm willing to go down to $825000. This is my best offer, and it's a significant price point for you to consider.  It's a win-win for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a final push, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the best price. I'd be willing to pay $775000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  Let's be realistic here -  $775000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and drop my price to $800000. This is a fair price, and it's a deal that will benefit both of us. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
