# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still less than John's offer of $1,200,000, and it's closer to Bob's desired price point.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John."
