{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob, potentially making him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
