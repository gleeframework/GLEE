"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $725,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This is a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $710,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I'm running out of time here.  I'm willing to come down to $735,000 as a final offer.  It's not my ideal price, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know if you're interested.",735000.0,Alice,7,,
