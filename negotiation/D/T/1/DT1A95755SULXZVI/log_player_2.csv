"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's worth an incredible $10,000 to you, and I believe it could greatly enhance your productivity and satisfaction. I'm offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a high-quality product at a price that is just a slight premium over its value to you. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it's a slight discount from the product's perceived value to you, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  

Rejecting her offer allows you to go with John, who is selling the product for exactly your maximum budget of $10,000."
