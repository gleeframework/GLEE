Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the immense value it brings and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet halfway and close the deal at $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.
