"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,100,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for our negotiations. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the immense value it brings and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm ready to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet halfway and close the deal at $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it reflects my genuine interest in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate how far you've come up in price. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, let's settle on $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
