"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $14,000 is less than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'd like to start at $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's minimum price. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The counteroffer leaves space for both Bob and Alice to negotiate. Alice may want to counter with a price higher than $12,500, but Bob can always counter back or accept if the price is within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,500 is better than the initial offer from Alice, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter again and potentially get closer to his target of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is showing willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between their previous offers. This suggests a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fair Price:**  $13,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. It also leaves a small buffer in case Alice wants to counter again."
