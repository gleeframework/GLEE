"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to be positive and friendly in your message, and to highlight the value Bob will receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'd like to start at $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is above my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I can likely get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation.  I also have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my asking price.  $13,000 is a good deal for me, and we've only used 4 rounds.  Continuing the negotiation risks getting stuck in a stalemate or losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
