"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider fair value for this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I had a higher number in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
