"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $100,000 less than what you're willing to pay. This is a good deal, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price by negotiating further.  Rejecting and counter-offering risks the deal falling apart, especially since John is offering the product for your maximum price."
