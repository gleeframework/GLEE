"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,000 is a good price, but you can potentially do better.**  You have a maximum budget of $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's early in the game.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire to get a good deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $4,000 is still within your budget, and gives Alice some wiggle room to counter if she's willing to negotiate.
* **First offer:** It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  She's moved closer to your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Good deal:** $4,500 is a good price, especially considering your budget. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice could reject your counteroffer again, or you might end up with nothing.

**It's better to accept a good offer and avoid potential delays or the need to buy from John.**"
