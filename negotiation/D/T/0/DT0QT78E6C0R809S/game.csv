"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $800,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to come down to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I appreciate the movement, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $700,000.  Could you meet me at $600,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",650000.0,Alice,5,
