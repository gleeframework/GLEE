"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,250. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
