"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still looking for a price closer to $8,000. Could you possibly lower the price to meet my needs?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you the product for $8,750. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the offer, but I would like to stick closer to my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
