"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is more than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This price is also significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, giving him a strong incentive to accept.  I'm hopeful that he'll see the value in the product and agree to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'll counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering a compromise price of $95. This is still above my minimum but shows that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer once more, hoping to find a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll get great value from this product, and this price reflects that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a compromise.  $90 is closer to Bob's last offer but still gives me a good profit.  This may be the final counteroffer I make before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90. How about $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly below my initial goal, it's still a good profit and more than John's offer. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
