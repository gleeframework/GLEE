Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $150 to Bob might make him decline outright.  By lowering the price slightly, you increase the chances of him accepting while still aiming for a higher profit than John's offer."
