"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  It's also worth noting that you have a backup option with John, so there's no pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than you'd like. You have several rounds left, and the goal is to save as much money as possible.  You can likely get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,087,500. This price would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,131,250.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,131,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,131,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, and she's stated this is her final offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk she could walk away, and you'd then have to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer saves you $368,750 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
