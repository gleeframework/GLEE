I'm not willing to accept $12,500, as my minimum price is $12,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum price of $12,000 and is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good deal for me, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk selling to John for less."
