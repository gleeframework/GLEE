Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
* **Potential for Premium:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it, especially if he perceives it as scarce or highly valuable to his needs.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If his counteroffers are too low, you can always walk away knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
