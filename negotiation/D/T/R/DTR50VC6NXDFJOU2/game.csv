"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a bit limited on my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do.  Let's see if we can agree on this",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? That's the best I can do.",8500.0,Bob,4,
