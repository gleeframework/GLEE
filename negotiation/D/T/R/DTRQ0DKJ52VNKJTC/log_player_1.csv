"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my ideal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering 950,000 leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Avoiding immediate John deal:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, as he's willing to pay more.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$850,000 is too low:** While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my ideal selling price and my initial offer.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and there's a chance I can push for a higher price.
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price. 

Let's try to meet in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Staying above John's offer:** I'm still above John's offer, ensuring that I'm not losing out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my goal:** $875,000 is closer to my desired price than John's offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiation might result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away entirely or running out of rounds.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and it's becoming crucial to secure a deal. 

It's time to lock in a profitable sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
