"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for further negotiation while ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it shows my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the negotiations have taken several rounds and it seems Bob is unlikely to meet my expectations.  Since John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000,  it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
