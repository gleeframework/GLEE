"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,300,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for both of us, and it fits within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your position.  However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To be fair to both of us, I propose we meet in the middle at $1,375,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's intrinsic value.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
