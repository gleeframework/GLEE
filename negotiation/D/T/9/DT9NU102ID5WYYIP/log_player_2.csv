"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm asking for $900000 for it, which is a significant discount from its true worth.  I know this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. If you're interested, please let me know and we can schedule a time to discuss the details further. If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
