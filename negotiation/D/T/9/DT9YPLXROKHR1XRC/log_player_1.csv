Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be valuable to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Optimism & Incentive:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value to Bob's business, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if Bob rejects. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more equitable price. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit.  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, as there's still room for him to increase his offer. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $1,125,000. This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** This strategy shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The message highlights fairness, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** The offer is closer to Bob's perceived value, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  $1,125,000 is still above my minimum, allowing for potential negotiation flexibility if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continued negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a stalemate or further price reduction, potentially leading to a deal below my minimum.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which exceeds my minimum and ensures a significant profit.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John guarantees a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price point."
