Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to negotiate you down.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to start high, being overly aggressive (like asking for $1,199,999) could make Bob walk away immediately.  The chosen price is high but still within a reasonable range.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage in a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both our minimum ($1,000,000) and his perceived value ($1,200,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation. Accepting his offer would mean leaving a lot of money on the table. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our backup plan, but we can likely get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. While $900,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider $1,075,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection, But Openness:**  We politely rejected Bob's initial offer, but reassured him that we're willing to negotiate. 
* **Significant Movement:** We moved down $75,000 from our initial offer, signaling flexibility. 
* **Still Above Our Minimum:** The new price of $1,075,000 keeps us comfortably above our $1,000,000 minimum while still leaving room for Bob to negotiate up.
* **Value Emphasis:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to our minimum price, his offer of $950,000 is still below our walk-away point. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, so we'll try one more time to meet in the middle before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. If you're willing to come up to $1,025,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  We're making it clear that this is our final offer to encourage Bob to take it seriously.
* **Compromise:** We've split the difference between his last offer ($950,000) and ours ($1,075,000).
* **Above Minimum:** This price point is still comfortably above our $1,000,000 minimum and gives us a significant profit.
* **Time Pressure:** By implying we have other options, we add a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
