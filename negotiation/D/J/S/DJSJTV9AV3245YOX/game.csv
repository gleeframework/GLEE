"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I. While $900,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we consider $1,075,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. If you're willing to come up to $1,025,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
