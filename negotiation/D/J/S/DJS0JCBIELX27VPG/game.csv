"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $950,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it a great compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm not willing to go as high as $900,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $920,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,
