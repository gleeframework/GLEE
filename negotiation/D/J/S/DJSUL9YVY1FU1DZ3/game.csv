"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both room to make a deal.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
