"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a significant investment for me. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $790,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
