"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's true value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $790,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go below $790,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk losing out on John's offer."
