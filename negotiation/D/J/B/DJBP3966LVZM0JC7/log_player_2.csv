"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a great deal, as I'm willing to come down from my initial valuation of $1500000 to accommodate your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
