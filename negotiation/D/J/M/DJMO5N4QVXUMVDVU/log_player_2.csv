You're still trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is only $500 below your maximum price, and you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going with John."

Alice has lowered her price to $9,250.  While this is getting closer to your maximum price, it's still not ideal.  You're now at a point where you need to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice or simply buying from John for a guaranteed $8,000. 

Considering your goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the most logical choice. It guarantees you the lowest price and avoids any further potential negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price."
