"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product at $12,000,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
