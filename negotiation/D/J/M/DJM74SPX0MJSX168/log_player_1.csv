Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know John will pay that. This gives Bob the chance to either accept or counteroffer, potentially leading to a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm also not willing to settle for significantly less than what it's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum price, and while I'd prefer to get $10,000, it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid losing more time and potentially having to start over with John."
