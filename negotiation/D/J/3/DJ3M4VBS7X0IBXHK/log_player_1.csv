{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 is a good starting point.** It's significantly more than my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's valuation of $150. 
* **A friendly message sets a positive tone.**  It acknowledges Bob's potential interest and invites him to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down.
* **Maintain a good relationship:**  A friendly approach encourages Bob to counteroffer rather than simply walk away.
* **Leave room for John:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can still fall back on John's $80 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is more than my minimum of $80, it's still quite a bit lower than my initial offer of $120.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some more negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show that I'm willing to negotiate:** This demonstrates that I'm flexible and open to finding a middle ground.
* **Gain more leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I put pressure on Bob to raise his price in the next round.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Continuing negotiations could potentially lead to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm not giving in too easily, which can strengthen my position. 
* **Still have the John backup:** If negotiations fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.  It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $100 is a substantial price and still allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Encourage a deal:**  A compromise makes it more likely Bob will accept my counteroffer. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is only $5 more than John's offer, it's important to consider the following:

* **Close to my minimum:**  It's only $5 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potentially less hassle:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids further negotiation and the possibility of a breakdown in talks.
* **Potential for future business:** Even though this deal is close to my minimum, it could build a relationship with Bob for future sales.

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a profit:** $85 is still a profit for me.
* **Minimize risk:**  Accepting avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, especially since it's close to my minimum.
* **Build a relationship:**  A successful deal with Bob could lead to future opportunities."
