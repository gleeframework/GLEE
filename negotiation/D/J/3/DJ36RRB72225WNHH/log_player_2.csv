Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our conversation and believe you'd truly benefit from this product. My final offer is $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe it's more than fair.  What are your thoughts?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,150,000. She's using negotiation tactics like mentioning another buyer to try to pressure you. Since you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice.  You'll save $150,000 by going with John."
