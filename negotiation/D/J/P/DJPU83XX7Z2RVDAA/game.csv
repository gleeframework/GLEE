,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. How about $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $102.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $97.50? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to close the deal. ",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting close to your minimum, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to close this quickly. ",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $105, Bob. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. If you're willing to meet me at $105, I'm happy to sell you the product. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Alice,9,
