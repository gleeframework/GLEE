"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit higher than what I had in mind.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $13,500 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet at $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I think we can do better than that. I'm making a strong case for the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it. Let's see if we can push the price up to $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,7,
