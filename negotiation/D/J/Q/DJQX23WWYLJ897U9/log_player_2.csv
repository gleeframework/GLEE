Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $7,950 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,950.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're in round 9 with only one round left. Alice is signaling this is her final offer.
* **Small Concession:** While Alice didn't lower the price further, the ""small bonus"" adds value and makes the deal slightly better than her previous $7,950 offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If we reject and go to round 10, there's a good chance we'll end up at $7,950 anyway, without the bonus, or Alice might not budge, forcing us to buy from John for $10,000.

Accepting at $7,950 with a bonus is a better outcome than risking the full $10,000 with John."
