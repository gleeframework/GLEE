"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to get Bob interested. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I aim to get a good deal while still keeping the possibility of selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob acknowledged the product's value to him.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control and allows me to try for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try to get closer to my desired price.  While I could sell to John right now, I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer that's closer to his price but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value (again):**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to emphasize why even my lower offer is still a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. My counteroffer is still quite high, but it shows that I'm open to finding a solution. I'm also trying to push Bob towards a price that's closer to my ideal, while acknowledging his financial constraints."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of failing to reach an agreement increases.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While not ideal, there's still potential to negotiate further if I reject this offer, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum, I'm going to accept his offer. It's a good deal for me, and it ensures I can move on to other opportunities.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a sale than to risk losing the deal completely."
