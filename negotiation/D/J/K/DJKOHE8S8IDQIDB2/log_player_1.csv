Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize that it's a ""great deal"" for Bob, which may make him more likely to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not demanding this price, but asking for his opinion. This leaves room for a counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me confidence to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $13,000 is less than my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Since Bob is willing to negotiate, there's still room for me to try and get a better price.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't come up to my desired price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a good compromise and still gives you a great deal on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $13,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize it being a ""good compromise"" and a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage acceptance.
* **Urgency:**  I mention closing the deal to create a sense of urgency and potentially nudge Bob towards acceptance. 
* **John is still my fallback:**  If Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer, I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000."
