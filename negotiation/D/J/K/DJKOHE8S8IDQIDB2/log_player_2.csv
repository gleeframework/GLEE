"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have room to negotiate since your maximum is $12,000 and Alice's minimum is $12,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a good compromise and still gives you a great deal on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

```

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within my budget and a good compromise. It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal or ending up paying more from John."
