"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering this product for a limited time at the price of $1,450,000. I believe it presents a unique value proposition, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns this product offers. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you considering my previous offer, but I need to see a more significant move to make this work.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between value and price.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, $900,000 is too low. To meet you closer to the middle, I propose $1,150,000. This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the value this product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
