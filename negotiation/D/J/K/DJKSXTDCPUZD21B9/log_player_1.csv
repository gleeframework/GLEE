Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,000,000 is his absolute limit.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal and maximize your profit."
