"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to negotiate a bit further. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
