# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $12,500. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me and the original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,500. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal instead of risking further negotiation."
