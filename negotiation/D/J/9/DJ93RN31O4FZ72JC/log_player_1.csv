Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Based on its potential value to you, I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant opportunity for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:**  My message highlights the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for a compromise.  If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on my backup buyer (John) to secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This price reflects a significant saving for you compared to John's offer, and would still give you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $1,400,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my target.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round.  Bob has already shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my desired price. This strategy allows me to maximize my profit potential while maintaining a potential deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within reason:**  My counteroffer is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price allows both of us to gain something, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I leave the door open for further discussions by asking ""Let's find common ground."" 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
