"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 but leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit. It also leaves Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, $60 is nowhere near my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply not feasible.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Would you consider $90?  This is still a great price for the product, and I think it would be a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but staying above my minimum acceptable price. $90 is still a good deal for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you can't go as low as $60, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, and I'm willing to offer the product for $85.  Let's close this deal and get you what you need!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a fair price.  Hopefully, this will be the final offer and we can both walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $80, my absolute final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While this offer is at my minimum acceptable price, it's better than walking away with nothing and having to deal with John. It seems like Bob is firm on his offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept this offer and move on."
