"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply not feasible.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. Would you consider $90?  This is still a great price for the product, and I think it would be a good deal for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you can't go as low as $60, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, and I'm willing to offer the product for $85.  Let's close this deal and get you what you need!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $80, my absolute final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
