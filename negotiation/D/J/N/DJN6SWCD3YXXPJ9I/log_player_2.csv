"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is better than your maximum valuation, you know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000.  You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
