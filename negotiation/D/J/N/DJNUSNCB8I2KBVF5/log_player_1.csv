**Reasoning:**

Bob has been very firm at $1,200,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll budge significantly from this point. Accepting his offer gives us a $200,000 profit over John's offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by pushing further."
