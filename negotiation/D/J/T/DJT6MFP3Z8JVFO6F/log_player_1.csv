"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm focusing on Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for compromise:** While I'm not willing to accept $100, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $125 is halfway between Bob's offer and my starting price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product, suggesting that $125 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining my profit margin:** This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while potentially securing a sale with Bob.
* **Setting the stage for a final agreement:** By moving closer to Bob's price, I'm hoping to create a situation where we can find a mutually agreeable price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest though, I have a pretty firm budget for this.  Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Exploring further compromise:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and is showing a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John remains a backup:** Having John as a potential buyer for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $110 is still a bit too far for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's price:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price to $115, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I frame the price as a fair compromise, suggesting that both of us are getting a good deal.
* **Reiterating the value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth, hoping to encourage him to accept my offer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss. 

I'm hoping this offer will be enough to sway Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
