"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest though, I have a pretty firm budget for this.  Could you do it for $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $110 is still a bit too far for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
