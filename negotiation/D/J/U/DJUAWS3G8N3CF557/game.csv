"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a slightly lower price point.  Considering its value to me and the potential for returns, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is fair, taking into account both our interests. I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I'm open to discussing any concerns you might have.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a compelling price, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and my own investment. To make this deal work, I'd need to receive a price closer to $1,300,000. This figure would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement, ensuring both our interests are met. Let's continue the conversation and find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial, and I'm hoping we can finalize it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
