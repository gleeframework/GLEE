"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. Can you consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $875,000.  Let's make this happen! ",875000.0,Alice,5,
