Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if needed, without losing out on your desired profit margin. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This helps to keep the negotiation process moving forward. 

I'm also including a friendly message to make Bob feel more comfortable and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a lower price. I would like to propose $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation and could potentially get a better price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I would like to suggest $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,600 is very close to my minimum. It's not worth risking losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with no sale at all. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and smooth transaction."
