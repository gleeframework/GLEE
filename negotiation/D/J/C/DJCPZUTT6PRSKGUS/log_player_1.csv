Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum desired price ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth less to Bob than to me.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic, trying to build a positive rapport with Bob. I'm highlighting the value of the product and making it clear I'm open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high but not too high:**  $9,500 allows for negotiation while still leaving a decent profit margin.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** By mentioning John's offer, I'm subtly implying that Bob needs to act quickly if he wants the product. 
* **Be flexible:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary.

This is just the first step, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).** Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.** This keeps the negotiation alive and gives me a chance to secure a better deal.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. This increases my bargaining power and sets the stage for a more balanced counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground so we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500:** This price is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing that it's not acceptable to me.  I'm  showing flexibility by lowering my initial offer and using language that promotes collaboration (""find a middle ground"").

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $8,500 is still a good price for me, leaving room for potential profit.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to counter with a price that is closer to my proposed $8,500. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), it is still below my minimum threshold. Accepting it would mean a loss for me. 
* I have a strong fallback option with John's offer of $10,000. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejection builds leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not under pressure to sell at his price.  It also signals that I am serious about getting a fair price.
* **Counteroffer in the next round:** I will use the next round to make a final counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price.

I am confident that by staying firm and continuing the negotiation, I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement or secure a sale to John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let's finalize this and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,250:**  This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $7,000.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort while maintaining my firm stance. The message emphasizes the importance of finalizing the deal while highlighting the potential loss if we can't agree. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Create a sense of urgency:**  By mentioning the potential loss of the opportunity, I'm subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Maintain a strong position:** $8,250 is still a reasonable price for me, ensuring a profit while also moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Signal finality:**  This counteroffer is presented as my final offer, leaving less room for further negotiation.

I'm ready to accept this offer if Bob accepts, but I'm also prepared to move forward with selling the product to John if necessary."
