This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let's finalize this and make this deal work.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than what John is offering. There's no guarantee Alice will go as low as $8,000.  It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point and secure the best deal."
