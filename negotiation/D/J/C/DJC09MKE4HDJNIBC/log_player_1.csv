Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a significant premium to my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest level and potentially secure a good price without having to go through multiple rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. This price should be more appealing to Bob without compromising my own bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  $1,300,000 is still too low.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but it still represents a healthy profit margin for me. I'm hoping this offer will finally be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting close to my minimum, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that we might not be able to reach an agreement. To ensure I don't lose time and potentially miss out on a better opportunity, I'm going to sell the product to John.  This is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
