Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to consider the potential benefits even though it's slightly above his perceived value. 

By offering a price slightly below John's offer, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob while aiming for a higher profit margin."
