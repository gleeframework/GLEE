"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
