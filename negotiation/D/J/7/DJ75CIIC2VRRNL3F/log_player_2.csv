{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's $120. 
* However, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

* $105 is still within your budget and a fair compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget of $120.
* It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower offer, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
