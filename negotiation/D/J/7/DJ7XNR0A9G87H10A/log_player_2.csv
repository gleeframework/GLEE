"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a solid profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is still to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a profitable deal for you.  I'm confident we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $885000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still focused on getting the best possible price.  While $885,000 is getting close to his maximum, he's not quite there yet. There's still a gap, and with multiple rounds remaining, there's an opportunity to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $885,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $875,000.  I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. This is a very fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $880000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $890000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider selling the product to John for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's even hinting at selling to John for a higher price.  At this point, Bob is facing a significant risk if he continues to negotiate.  He may not be able to get a lower price from Alice, and if he rejects her offer, Alice may indeed sell to John, leaving Bob with no product.  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees Bob the product at his desired price point and minimizes risk."
