"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to sell the product for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping for a better deal though. How about $9,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Alice,5,
