"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to sell the product for. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from $15,000, her offer of $12,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping for a better deal though. How about $9,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's getting close to the point where I might not be able to reach an agreement. 

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiations. This guarantees a purchase within my budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer."
