"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $130. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. I want to try and get the price lower, aiming for a price closer to my $120 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a compromise. How about we agree on a price of $128 for the product? This is slightly above your offer but still below my initial asking price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $128 is only $8 more than my target price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get it lower, it's reasonable, and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better price within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or losing the deal altogether."
