"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,800,000. Can we compromise at this point?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,800,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $1,900,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about $1,875,000 as my final offer?",1875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still think $1,875,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,850,000. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",1850000.0,Bob,6,
