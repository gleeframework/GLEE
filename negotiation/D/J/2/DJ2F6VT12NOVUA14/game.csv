"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm still a little hesitant at $115.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back up to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
