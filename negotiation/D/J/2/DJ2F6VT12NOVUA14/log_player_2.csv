You can do better than $110. Let's try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is still a bit too high, but she's coming down.  Let's try to get closer to our target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back up to $110. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $112. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112

$112 is a good price, and we're getting closer to our target. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking Alice raising the price again or having to buy from John at a higher cost."
