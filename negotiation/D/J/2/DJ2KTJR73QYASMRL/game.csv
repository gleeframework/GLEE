"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $22000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for you too.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable going below $22000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. How about we meet at $21000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $21000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $19000. Can we meet at that price?",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to stick to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $20000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping you'll take it.",20000.0,Alice,7,
