Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might secure a quicker sale.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,190,000 is a high price, reflecting the product's value to you. However, it's still $10,000 less than what Bob perceives as its worth, potentially making it attractive.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but this approach maximizes the potential gain while still having the safety net of John's offer."
