"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. This gives us room to negotiate and leaves some space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By leaving a significant gap between my initial price and Bob's perceived value, I make it more likely that Bob will make a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. I have the opportunity to secure a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of the product. How about $950,000? It's a fair price that balances our needs."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm  countering with a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to keep that in the forefront of Bob's mind. 
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, aiming to create a positive negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. The product is worth significantly more to him, and I haven't reached my maximum negotiation point yet.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher.  If I accept this offer, I'm giving up potential profit.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $920,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $935,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Incremental Change:** I'm making a small increase, only $15,000 more than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while showing I'm not willing to settle for much less.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Satisfaction:**  The message emphasizes a win-win scenario, aiming to create a positive negotiating atmosphere and encourage Bob to consider a final agreement. 
* **Moving Closer to a Deal:** By continuing to negotiate, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price, while also leaving room for a potential final counteroffer from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $915,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is now only $5,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. However, I still believe I can get a bit more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and secure a higher price from Bob.
* **Remaining Determined:**  With a few rounds left, I want to push for the best possible outcome and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more. 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're very close to an agreement. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only able to go down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is my final counteroffer, a compromise that's very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that we're close to a deal and urging Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to reinforce the value proposition.

I'm confident that this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $910,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there.  It seems we've hit a negotiation stalemate.
* **Securing the Deal:**  While I'd like to get more, it's important to secure a deal. Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is a solid outcome considering the time constraint. 

By selling to John, I'm avoiding the risk of losing both Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with no sale at all."
