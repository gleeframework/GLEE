Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit margin if Bob accepts immediately. This price point aims to capture a large portion of the value difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a backup plan with John, but selling to Bob at a higher price is optimal."
