Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $10,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,650? It's a fair price that's still within your budget, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's work together to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10650}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $10,300? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below what I'd hoped for, it's a reasonable compromise and is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
