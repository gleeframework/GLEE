"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the unique value of this product. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to your comfort zone, but I still think this product is worth more than $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell it to you for $11750. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $11250. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a significant compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11250. I'll make one more counteroffer, and if you're willing to meet me at $11500, I'll consider it. This is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal.
