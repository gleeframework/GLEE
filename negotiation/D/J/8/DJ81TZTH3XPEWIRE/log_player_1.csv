{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Negotiation Room:** I'm leaving room for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,000,000 is a significant sum, making the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to be assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my ideal price, I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round of negotiations and counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 as a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round of negotiations and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my target."
