Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement. To avoid further delays and ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
