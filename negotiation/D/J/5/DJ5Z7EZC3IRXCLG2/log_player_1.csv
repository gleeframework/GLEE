"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum desired price in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and it's still better to continue negotiating with him. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I am confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm dropping the price again to $10,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a healthy margin. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between being firm and reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting risky with only 4 rounds left. Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, the time pressure is high, and I'm confident John will be a reliable buyer."
