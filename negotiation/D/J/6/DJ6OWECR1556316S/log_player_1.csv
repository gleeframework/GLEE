Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's important to remember that the goal is to maximize my earnings, but I also want to avoid losing a sale to John.  

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Fair Value:**  I'm offering the product at its true value to Bob. This makes the offer seem reasonable and reduces the likelihood of immediate rejection.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Back-up Plan:** John's offer provides a safety net, giving me the power to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. 

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, but I'm still very interested in acquiring it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,000,000).  I'm not willing to settle for a 20% loss at this stage. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to bridge the gap while still maximizing my profit. I'll factor in John's offer as a reference point to ensure I don't get caught in a protracted negotiation that could lead to losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** My counteroffer of $900,000 represents a compromise. I'm willing to move from my initial asking price of $1,000,000 but am still seeking a substantial profit.
* **Maintaining Value:** By sticking to a price above $800,000, I signal that I understand the product's value and am not desperate to sell.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message again emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.

This counteroffer should keep the negotiation moving forward while ensuring that I don't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's only a 15% discount from my initial offer and a significant improvement from his previous offer. 

**Here's why I'm accepting:**

* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, potentially costing me valuable time.
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, there's a risk that Bob could walk away altogether, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Fair Compromise:** $850,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale without significantly sacrificing profit.

This decision balances the need to maximize earnings with the need to avoid losing the sale altogether."
