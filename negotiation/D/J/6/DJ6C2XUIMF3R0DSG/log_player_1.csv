Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping to capture some of the potential surplus.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $900,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within a range Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. It's only a small amount lower than what John is willing to pay, and further negotiation might be unproductive.  It's important to secure a deal while the opportunity is still there."
