"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Confident Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing its true worth to you.  
* **Open to Discussion:**  While the initial price is high, the language indicates a willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and the product's actual value to him ($800,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a deal that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant, but Gradual Concession:** While the goal is to move closer to Bob's range, dropping to his initial offer immediately would be too drastic. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates that the product's value is higher than Bob's offer, justifying the higher counteroffer.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** The message ends on a conciliatory note, suggesting that further negotiation can lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I can manage.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $800,000?  That would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $800,000 is still below your minimum, it indicates he recognizes the product's value to him.  It's highly likely he's willing to go higher. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table.  It's worth countering to see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about the product's value to you. I'm always willing to work towards a mutually beneficial deal. Considering that, I could be flexible and come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Value:** By stating that you understand the product's worth to Bob, you build rapport and show you are negotiating in good faith.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A drop to $1,600,000 is a significant move, demonstrating flexibility but still keeping the price well above Bob's offer and your guaranteed option with John. 
* **Anchoring:** This counteroffer aims to set a new reference point closer to your desired outcome, encouraging Bob to negotiate upwards from $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our prices is still too large. I'm serious about buying, but I need you to be more realistic.  Would you consider $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still too far from your $1,500,000 minimum.  You've made significant concessions, and now it's time to see if Bob is willing to move closer to your range.  Rejecting this offer signals that you are serious about the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,400,000? This is a substantial compromise on my end, and it reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes seeking a mutually agreeable solution, signaling a collaborative approach.
* **Significant but Calculated Concession:** A drop to $1,400,000 is substantial, but it's still comfortably above your safety net with John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting your desire to close the deal creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to make a more significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm offering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial juncture. Bob is clearly committed and has significantly increased his offer, but it's still below your $1,500,000 guarantee. However, his language (""final offer"") suggests he might be bluffing to pressure you. You have two rounds left and the advantage of a guaranteed sale with John. It's worth one more counteroffer to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make this work.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a substantial compromise from my original position and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1250000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You acknowledge Bob's efforts but stand firm by presenting your offer as ""final."" 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,250,000 is a strong middle ground. It's a significant profit above your guarantee and likely within Bob's range if his ""final offer"" was a negotiating tactic.
* **Time Constraint:** With only one round remaining, this creates a clear deadline for Bob to make a decision.  This increases the chance of him accepting, knowing you have other options."
