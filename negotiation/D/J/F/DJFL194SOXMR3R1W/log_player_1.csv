Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A starting price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Gauging Bob's interest:** This initial offer helps gauge how interested Bob is and if he's willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
