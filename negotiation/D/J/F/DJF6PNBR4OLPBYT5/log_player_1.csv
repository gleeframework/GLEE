Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,600,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.
