"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,600,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand your position.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
