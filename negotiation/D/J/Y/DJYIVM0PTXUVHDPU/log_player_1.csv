Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob ($850,000). This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a good profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal that benefits both of us. This helps to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **John as backup:**  While I'm starting negotiations with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $800,000. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's tempting to take his offer, selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a better outcome.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm offering, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still lower than my initial offer.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while emphasizing the product's value and the benefit of a deal for both of us. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that works for both of us, hoping to reach an agreement. 

By doing this, I'm demonstrating flexibility while maintaining my position that the product is worth more than $750,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you're offering. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiations, I've already made several concessions and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob. 

To guarantee my minimum profit, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures a stable outcome and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
