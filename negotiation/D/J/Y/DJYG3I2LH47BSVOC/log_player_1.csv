Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my minimum acceptable price is $15,000, starting at $12,000 allows for a back-and-forth exchange. This makes the negotiation feel more interactive and less confrontational.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  I need to ensure I get at least that much for the product.
* **I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $15,000.** There's no reason to settle for less, especially since Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my ideal price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired $15,000. I'll be mindful of Bob's willingness to pay and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:**  I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, so there's still room for me to make a profit.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not completely giving in to Bob's offer, reminding him that I have other options (John) and that my product has value.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  I've secured a decent deal!
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to decide if I'm willing to negotiate further or sell to John.  It's a risk/reward situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  Even though he's increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and there's no guarantee Bob will ever agree to my price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed and higher.** John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will immediately reach out to John and finalize the sale."
