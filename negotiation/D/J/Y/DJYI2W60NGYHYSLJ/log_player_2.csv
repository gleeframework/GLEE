"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a better price than John's $120, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $105 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate, but still leaves some space for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110? I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to make a decent profit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Bob has successfully lowered the price from $115 to $110, and there's room for further negotiation to potentially get closer to his ideal price. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about $108?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but now offering a price closer to Alice's last offer. This shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  $108 is a small increase from his previous offer, and may be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
