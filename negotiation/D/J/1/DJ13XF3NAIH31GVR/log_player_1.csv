"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  I know the product is worth less to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in it and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  I believe $16,000 is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and Bob's potential benefit from acquiring it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to $15,000.  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, dropping the price to $14,500.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target of $15,000. I'm confident that there's still room for a compromise, especially considering Bob's previous willingness to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small margin.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while still holding firm on a price that's fair to me. I'm hoping that this final concession will convince Bob to accept. If not, I'm prepared to consider selling to John at $15,000 in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob at a higher price, I'm still getting my minimum desired value.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be a gamble, and there's no guarantee he'd eventually meet my price.  Selling to John ensures I get my target profit with minimal risk."
