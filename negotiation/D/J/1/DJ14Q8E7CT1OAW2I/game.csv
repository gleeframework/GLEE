"Alice, thanks for the offer, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm ready to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
