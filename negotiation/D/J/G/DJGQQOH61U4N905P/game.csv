"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
