"Alice,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
