Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $722,500, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $720,000.  While we could likely push her a little further, the gains are getting smaller and we risk her becoming frustrated with the negotiation. Accepting at $722,500 secures a significant discount from both her original offer and John's price."
