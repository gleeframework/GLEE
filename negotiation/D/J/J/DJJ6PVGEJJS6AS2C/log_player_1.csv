"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested, but  $1400000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds, and selling to John guarantees my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle. With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John at my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still not feasible for me. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1175000. This is a strong offer that's fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close this today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,175,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate a price that meets my minimum.  Selling to John ensures that I get my desired price, which is the most important factor for me."
