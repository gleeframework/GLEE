"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested, but  $1400000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still not feasible for me. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $1200000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1175000. This is a strong offer that's fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close this today.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
