Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,000. I'd be willing to consider $7,500 for the product. It's a great deal for me, but I think it's a bit more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept $7,500, as that's below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
