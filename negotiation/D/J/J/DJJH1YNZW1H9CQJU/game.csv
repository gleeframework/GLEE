"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value for me. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, given your estimated value. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already made my best offer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope you can understand my position.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
