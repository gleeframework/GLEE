"Alice,  while I appreciate the value you see in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects the maximum value I'm able to assign to it at this time. Let me know if you're open to this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? This allows me to make a profit while giving you a substantial discount.  Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to make a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let me know if you're open to this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
