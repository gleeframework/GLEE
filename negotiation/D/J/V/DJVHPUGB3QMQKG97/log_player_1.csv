Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving me some room to negotiate.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $10,000 to him, so I'm not worried about losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe the product is worth more to him, and I'm willing to counteroffer to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
