"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my willingness to close this deal quickly. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know what you think.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my need for a quick close.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be fair to both of us, I can drop my price to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
