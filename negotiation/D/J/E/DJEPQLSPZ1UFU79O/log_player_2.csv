"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,300,000 since it's worth $1,200,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, but lower than what she offered. This gives her some incentive to accept, while still saving me money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is lower than the $1,300,000 she offered initially, and it's within my budget. It's also closer to the product's worth to Alice, which means she's likely to accept it.  Continuing to negotiate might not get me a significantly better price, and it risks losing the deal altogether."
