"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to bargain and appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This tests his willingness to negotiate and might make your ""concessions"" seem more significant later.
* **Below John's Offer:** It's crucial to stay below John's offer of $1,200,000 to ensure you have room to negotiate without risking a worse deal. 

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation high and gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and John's standing offer. You have room to negotiate and aim for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the unique features and benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Lowering the price by $50,000 demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's unique features and benefits reinforces its value and justifies the higher price point.
* **Strategic Concession:** The decrease is significant enough to show movement but not so drastic that it undermines your position or creates the impression of desperation.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while emphasizing the product's value to justify a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but $950,000 is still considerably less than your $1,200,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer.  You have time to negotiate and try to bridge the gap further. Bob's persistence suggests he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,025,000?  This price reflects a significant concession on my part while recognizing the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($950,000) and your previous price ($1,050,000), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Concession:** Highlighting your significant price reduction might encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  With five rounds remaining, this offer maintains a good balance between pursuing a higher price and securing a deal with Bob before potentially losing him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and while Bob is consistently increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller. His latest offer of $975,000 is still significantly below your $1,200,000 walk-away point. It's time to signal that your price flexibility is decreasing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be upfront â€“ $975,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can go down to $1,010,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal a sense of urgency and limit further lowballing.
* **Small Concession:** A $15,000 decrease shows you are still negotiating, but the small amount emphasizes the seriousness of your position. 
* **Value Reminder:** Reiterate the product's value to justify the price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.

This approach aims to secure a deal above $1,000,000. Bob has a choice: accept a still-favorable deal or risk losing the product altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $985,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging significantly despite your ""final offer.""  His increases are minimal, and he seems determined to stay near the $980,000 - $990,000 range.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob poses a higher risk than reward:

* **Lost Time:** The remaining two rounds might not be enough to bridge the gap to an acceptable price.
* **Potential Deadlock:** Bob might be unwilling to move substantially from his current position.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $1,200,000 is a sure thing, guaranteeing you your desired minimum.

It's strategically sound to cut your losses with Bob and accept John's offer. It's better to walk away with a guaranteed, favorable deal than risk getting stuck with a less profitable outcome."
