Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer closer to Bob's valuation increases the potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room:**  A price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims to secure a price that's significantly higher than your minimum while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
