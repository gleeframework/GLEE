"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1100000 is still quite a stretch for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I still need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle now.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate, and I recognize that we're getting close.  While your offer is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go to $1025000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1025000 is the best price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1025000 and my last offer of $1050000. I'm counteroffering at $1037500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
