"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? It's still a good deal for you, and allows us to reach a fair agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. How about we settle at $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?  That's a strong offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
