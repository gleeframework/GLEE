"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a profit.  I hope this counteroffer encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to accept it, as the potential for a higher offer from Bob is unlikely given his previous counteroffers. This ensures a good profit and avoids risking losing the sale to John."
