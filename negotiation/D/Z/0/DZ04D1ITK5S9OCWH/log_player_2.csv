It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have a clear fallback option in John, so you have leverage to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount.  It's a bold move, but it's a good starting point for negotiations.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on her response."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price by sending another counteroffer.  I'm getting closer to John's price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a lower price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Alice's offer is only $50,000 less than John's price.  The negotiation has gone on long enough, and there's a good chance that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better price.  I'll go with John, who is offering a more predictable and reliable deal."
