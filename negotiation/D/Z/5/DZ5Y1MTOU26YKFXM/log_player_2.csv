"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:** You pay $950,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, resulting in a $50,000 profit.
* **Buying from John:** You pay $1,000,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, resulting in no profit.

It's always better to accept Alice's offer and get a profit, even if it's a smaller profit than you could potentially get from negotiating further."
