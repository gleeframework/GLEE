Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering both our perspectives. Let me know your thoughts.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. There's no reason to settle for $950,000 when he can get it for $800,000 elsewhere."
