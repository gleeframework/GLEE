"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her product's worth, you can get a better deal from John for $100.  Since your goal is to save money and the product is capped at a $100 value for you, buying from John is the most financially sensible decision."
