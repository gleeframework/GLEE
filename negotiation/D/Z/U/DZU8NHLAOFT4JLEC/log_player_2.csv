Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll include a one-year warranty and premium support package, which is normally valued at $1,000. So, the total price would be $10,000 for the product, plus the warranty and support package. What do you think?

This is a good deal for Bob! While the warranty and support package may not be worth $1000 to him, getting the product at Alice's lowest price makes this a better deal than buying from John."
