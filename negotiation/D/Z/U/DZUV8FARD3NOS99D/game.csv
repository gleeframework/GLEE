"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. However,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $12,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,000, which is $12,750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,7,
