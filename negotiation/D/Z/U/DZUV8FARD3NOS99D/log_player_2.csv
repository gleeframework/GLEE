Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,000, which is $12,750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly closer to $8,000 before the 10 rounds are up.  It makes more financial sense to cut our losses and buy from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000."
