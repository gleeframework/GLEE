"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the substantial return you stand to gain.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I see your point, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the discussions, I believe a price closer to $1,600,000 could be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I envision, I'm still seeking a value that reflects the true worth of this product.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in finding a mutual agreement. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hesitant to reach $1,650,000. Let's try $1,625,000. It's a step towards your valuation while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1625000.0,Bob,6,
