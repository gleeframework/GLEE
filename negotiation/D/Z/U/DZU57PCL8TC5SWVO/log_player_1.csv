Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I envision, I'm still seeking a value that reflects the true worth of this product.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued efforts in finding a mutual agreement. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hesitant to reach $1,650,000. Let's try $1,625,000. It's a step towards your valuation while staying within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly willing to pay a significant premium over my fallback option (John). Accepting $1,625,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of the deal falling through in later rounds."
