Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it for $22,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but  $8,000 is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but $19,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I can see you're serious about this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
