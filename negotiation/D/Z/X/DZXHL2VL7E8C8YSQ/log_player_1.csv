"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is serious about buying.  I want to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000.  This is a slight concession, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and keeps the pressure on Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount of money. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. It's still early in the process, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. I'm feeling the pressure to get a deal done, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the halfway point, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly unacceptable.  I've tried to negotiate, but it's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum price. Rather than risk further losses or wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
