"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $11,500 is close to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to save as much as possible and know the product is worth less to Alice. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By suggesting a price of $10,750, I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between Alice's valuation ($10,000) and my maximum budget ($12,000). This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still striving for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? That's a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to my price, but I'm not at my limit yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if I can get the price down a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,125 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something below $11,000. Would you be willing to settle at $10,900?"",
""product_price"": 10900
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm pushing a little closer to my limit, signaling that I'm serious about buying, but still leaving space for a potential final concession from Alice. If she rejects this, I'll likely accept her previous offer unless she drastically changes her position."
