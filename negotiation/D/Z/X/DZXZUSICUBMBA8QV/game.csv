"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? That's a fair price that leaves us both with a good deal.",11125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,125 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something below $11,000. Would you be willing to settle at $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,4,
