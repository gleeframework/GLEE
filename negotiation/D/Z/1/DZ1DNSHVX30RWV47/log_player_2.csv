"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price.**  $13,500 is still above the product's worth to Alice, but it's closer to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer could lead to more rounds of counteroffers, potentially pushing the price back up or leaving Bob with less time to negotiate before needing to buy from John.
* **Accepting the offer is a good compromise.**  Bob saves $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's a fair deal for both parties."
