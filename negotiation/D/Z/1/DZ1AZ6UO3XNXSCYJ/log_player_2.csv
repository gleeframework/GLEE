Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you like the compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell the product to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still aiming for a better deal. It's worth making one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I can do $75, and I think that's a really fair price. It's more than halfway from our last offers, and it would help me out a lot."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway again! I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a small step back from our last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is unlikely to come down to my target price, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in significant savings. John's offer of $80 is the best option now."
