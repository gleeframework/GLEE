"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I know Bob values the product.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired $15,000.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm willing to walk away if the deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is closer to my goal of $15,000, but it's still below what I consider fair. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round by making a counteroffer. I'm also aware that John is a backup option, but I'm going to try and get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price of $15,500. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.  I believe this is a fair offer, given that it's closer to my desired price and still less than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round by making a counteroffer. I'm also aware that John is a backup option, but I'm going to try and get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to stick with my desired price of $15,000. I believe it's fair, given that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and it's still a significant discount from what John is offering. This is my final offer.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John."
