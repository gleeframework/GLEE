{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move to set a lower negotiation range and see if Alice is willing to compromise. The offer is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for both parties to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Although Alice's offer is better than her initial price, Bob is still willing to negotiate further. He's not in a rush and knows he has other options, including buying from John. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation process going, potentially leading to a more favorable deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's value but is still trying to get a good deal. This offer is a slight increase from his previous counteroffer, showing he's willing to compromise while still staying below Alice's latest offer. It's a strategic move to test if Alice is ready to close the deal at a price slightly above her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is now very close to Bob's ideal price.  It's a good compromise, and accepting it would save Bob $1,100 compared to buying from John.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product."
