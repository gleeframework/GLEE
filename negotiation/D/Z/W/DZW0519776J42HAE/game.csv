"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $22,000. I think it's a fair price for the benefits it will bring you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see this deal happening.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer.  This is a significant discount already, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $16,000 is still more than I can realistically afford.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gets us closer to your price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
