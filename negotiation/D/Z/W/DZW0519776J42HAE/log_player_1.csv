Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in buying, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $16,000 is still more than I can realistically afford.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and gets us closer to your price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
