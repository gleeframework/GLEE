Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,250 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd need to get it down to $10,000. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting Bob's offer for $10,000 is the best choice in this round.  It's still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for a higher price.  There's always the chance Bob will walk away, and then I'd be left with nothing."
