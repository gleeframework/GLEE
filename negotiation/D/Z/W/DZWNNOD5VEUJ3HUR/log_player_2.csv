"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We are starting with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer of $70, the product is quite valuable and I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still higher than what we aim for. We'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise."",

}
``` 

We are nudging the price closer to our desired range while maintaining a polite and compromising tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly interested in this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, which is also a fair deal for us. There's no point in further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
