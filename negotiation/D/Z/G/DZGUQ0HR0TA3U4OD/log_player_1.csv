Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, creating a potential surplus.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's:
    * Significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it attractive.
    * Substantially above your minimum, ensuring a good profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a range in mind you're willing to accept.
* **Relationship:** While maximizing profit is key, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable. A slightly lower price now could lead to future opportunities.
