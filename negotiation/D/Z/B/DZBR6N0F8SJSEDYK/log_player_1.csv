Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $12,000 from John. 
* **Bob's value:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By offering $14,000, I maximize my potential profit while still being competitive enough for Bob to consider."
