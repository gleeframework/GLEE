# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I believe it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
