While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. I've already compromised considerably, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without further hassle."
