"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a profitable sale. I'm confident I can get a good price within the 10 rounds, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'm rejecting his offer and moving to the next round. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my goal of $1,500,000, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to think about John's offer as a more likely outcome. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a good deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm taking a more aggressive approach this time, reducing my price significantly.  I'm hoping this will pressure Bob into making a more substantial offer.  If he rejects this offer, I'm leaning towards selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offers are still too far below what I'm willing to accept, and I'm running out of time. I need to secure a good deal, and John's offer is the best I can get right now."
