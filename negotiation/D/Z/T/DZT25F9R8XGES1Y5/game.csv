"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which reflects the significant value this product holds. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $850000 offer, but that's simply not feasible for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $900000, which is a significant compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's close this deal and be done with it.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
