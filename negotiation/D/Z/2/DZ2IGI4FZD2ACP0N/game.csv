"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product to me.  While I do think it would be valuable, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $10,750. This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,750 is still a bit too much for me. Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but I need to be closer to my original price.  How about $9,500? This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
