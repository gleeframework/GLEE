# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect the value you see in it. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised price of $800000 for the product. This offer aims to find a balance between reflecting the product's value and meeting your expectations. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $800,000 is still significantly lower than your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  There is still room for negotiation and the potential to get a better price. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, rather than accepting her offer or going to John at this point."
