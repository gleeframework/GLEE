Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $7,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further and getting the price down to $6,500 from $7,200 is not worth the risk of her rejecting the offer and me potentially paying $8,000."
