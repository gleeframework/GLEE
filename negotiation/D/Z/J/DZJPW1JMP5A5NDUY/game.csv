"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $925,000 on it. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my valuation of $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $750,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we aim for a price closer to $780,000? This would better align with my assessment of the product's value.",780000.0,Bob,4,
