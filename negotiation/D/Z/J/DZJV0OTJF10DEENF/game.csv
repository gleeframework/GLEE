Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your counteroffer, so I'll make a new offer of $875000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your new offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $885000?",885000.0,Alice,5,
