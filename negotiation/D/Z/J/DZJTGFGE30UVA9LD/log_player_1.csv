Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering the product at its full value to Alice ($10,000) establishes a strong negotiating position. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $10,000, there might be some room for negotiation if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial price."
