"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
