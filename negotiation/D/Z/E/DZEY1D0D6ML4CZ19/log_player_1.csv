Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your value for the product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since we're already in the fourth round and I haven't given in easily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now, before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
