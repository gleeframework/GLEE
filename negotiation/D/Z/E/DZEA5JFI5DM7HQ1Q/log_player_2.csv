# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me. It's a significant investment for you, and I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle.
