"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see at least $1050000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects that.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,950000.0
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me. It's a significant investment for you, and I believe the value of this product justifies a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1000000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
