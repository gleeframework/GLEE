It's a good start, but there's room for negotiation.  Alice is clearly motivated to sell."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice is meeting your maximum price. There's no point in going to John as the price will be the same. Accept the offer and get the deal done!"
