"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let's try to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
