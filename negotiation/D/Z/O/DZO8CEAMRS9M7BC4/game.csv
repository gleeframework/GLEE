"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for this. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested in it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1200000. However, I'd like to offer an additional $50000 to sweeten the deal. Would you be willing to consider this?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to add a sweetener to the deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge on the price just yet. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to think about the value I've added to the product. I can offer it to you for $1350000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This is my final offer on the price, but I'm open to negotiating other terms if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $1250000. I'd also like to propose a service contract that will help increase the product's value over time. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. Would you be willing to consider this?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm intrigued by the idea of a service contract, Bob. It could indeed add value to the product and create a mutually beneficial partnership. However, I'm not willing to accept the $1250000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to ensure that the contract is substantial and provides a clear path for growth. I can offer the product to you for $1300000, and I'd like to discuss the terms of the service contract in more detail. What do you propose?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm willing to meet you at $1250000 for the product. I'd like to propose a 3-year service contract with regular check-ins and performance metrics to ensure we're both aligned on the product's growth. This will provide a clear path for growth and value creation. Would you be willing to accept this offer?,1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I like the idea of a 3-year service contract with regular check-ins and performance metrics. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need to ensure that the contract is more comprehensive and provides a clear roadmap for growth. I'd like to propose a 4-year contract with quarterly check-ins, and I'd like to include a clause for additional services that will be provided to ensure the product's continued success. If you're willing to accept these terms, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer on the price, but I'm open to negotiating the contract terms further.",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, Alice. I'll accept the 4-year contract with quarterly check-ins and the clause for additional services. I'm willing to pay $1280000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,10,
