Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I can potentially get more. I'll see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While your $1,200,000 offer is my minimum, I believe the value this product brings to you justifies a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,220,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly higher than my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,220,000 is a good outcome, and it's better than selling to John for my minimum."
