Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, I can gauge his interest level. If he flat out rejects it, I know he might not be willing to go much higher than $10,000. If he counters, it opens up the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate.  This allows me to be firmer in my pricing with Bob."
