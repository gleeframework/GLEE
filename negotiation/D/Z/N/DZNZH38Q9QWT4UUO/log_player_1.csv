"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $875,000?  That's a significant price increase from my initial offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting close, but it's still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to offer $885,000 as a final offer. This keeps us moving closer to a deal, but I need you to meet me halfway.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds left and the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
