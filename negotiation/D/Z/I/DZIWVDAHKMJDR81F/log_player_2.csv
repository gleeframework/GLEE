"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $600,000 is a good discount, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $500,000 for this product.  It's a good starting point, but I believe there's some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $550,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but accepting this offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John, and it's still within Bob's budget."
