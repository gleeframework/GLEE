"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950000. Would you be willing to consider a compromise at $975000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1150000.
