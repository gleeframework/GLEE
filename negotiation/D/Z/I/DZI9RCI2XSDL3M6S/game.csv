"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $12,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $13,200 to make it worth my while. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13200.0,Alice,5,
