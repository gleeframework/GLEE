"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum value of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you are willing to compromise while leaving some room for him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $150, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($150). While I could sell to John for that price, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price range through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $100? That's still a great price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. Considering the product's value to me, could we possibly agree on $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired range. I'm confident that with a bit more negotiation, I can reach a higher price. The risk of selling to John for $150 is still present, but I believe there's potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me, would $100 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  I've already rejected several offers, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on the sale to John."
