"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me is $150, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $100? That's still a great price considering the product's worth to you.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. Considering the product's value to me, could we possibly agree on $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
