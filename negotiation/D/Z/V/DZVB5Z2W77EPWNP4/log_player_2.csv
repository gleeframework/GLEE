Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  It's better to secure the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
