"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is my final offer, as I can always get the product from John for $100.  Let's make this deal happen.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'll accept $135.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to move on.",135.0,Alice,5,
