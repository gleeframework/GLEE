"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  $105 is a fair price, but I'm still a little higher. How about $108? That's a good compromise, and we can close this deal.",108.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure I can go as high as $108. How about $102? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $102 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $102, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Can you accept that?",102.0,Bob,8,
