"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting fair value.  How about $1,300,000?  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential ROI, while still remaining competitive.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1,250,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
