"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will consider it given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is a decent price, I'm not satisfied with that profit margin yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm going to counter with $88. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to earn more, Bob's offer of $86 is getting closer to my ideal price. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $80."
