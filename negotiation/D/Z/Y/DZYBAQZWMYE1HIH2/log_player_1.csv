"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it attractive to him. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also keeping the deal alive for potential further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm not willing to settle for that amount, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum value, and I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept, considering he values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not ready to settle.  We're already in round 4, which means I have 6 more rounds to potentially get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if I can nudge him up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $8,900.  Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher than $8,700, but I'm still holding out for something closer to $9,000. This is a slight compromise, but it keeps the negotiation going and allows me to see if I can get him to budge just a bit more.  If he rejects again, I'll have to consider the option of selling to John, as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is only $100 away from my minimum acceptable value. We are already in round 6, and I have only 4 more rounds to make a deal with him. It's unlikely that we'll reach a higher price with more negotiation.  This offer is also significantly better than John's offer, so I'll accept it to secure the sale."
