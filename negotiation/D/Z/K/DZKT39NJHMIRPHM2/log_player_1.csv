Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the good deal for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants to.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10000 for the product. Is this within your budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I cannot accept his offer.
