"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,300,000. I believe this strikes a more equitable balance.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
