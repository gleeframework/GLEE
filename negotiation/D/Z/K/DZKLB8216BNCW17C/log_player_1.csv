"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return you'll see from it."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 
My strategy here is to start with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This achieves a few things:

* **Anchoring:** It sets a high starting point for the negotiation. Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this offer influences his perception of what's negotiable.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** His reaction will tell me a lot about his eagerness and how flexible he might be. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I fully expect to negotiate, and this high starting point allows for concessions while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I know Bob's valuation is $800,000. This means there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to engage in a few more rounds to try and secure a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to $1,000,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,300,000. I believe this strikes a more equitable balance."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:** The new price is still significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, giving me room to maneuver.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal more about Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $900,000, I might consider selling to John sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob offering $1,050,000 puts me in a very favorable position. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Exceeds My Minimum:**  This offer is $50,000 more than my guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has shown he's willing to pay a premium above his own valuation, indicating strong interest in the product. 
* **Minimizes Risk:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
