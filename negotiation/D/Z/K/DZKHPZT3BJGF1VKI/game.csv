"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $20,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $15,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $18,000. Can we settle on $16,500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
