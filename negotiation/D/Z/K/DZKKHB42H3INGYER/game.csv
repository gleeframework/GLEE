"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, given the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $1,300,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
