Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him and avoid further negotiation, I can potentially get a better price. I'm not willing to settle for the absolute minimum right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $1,300,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation could drag on and risk the deal falling through completely. I need to weigh the potential for a slightly better price against the risk of losing the sale altogether.  $1,250,000 is a solid deal and ensures I don't end up with nothing."
