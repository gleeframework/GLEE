It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  $5,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $4,000 is a good starting point, and I'm willing to go up a bit if necessary."

Alice is coming down, but it's worth seeing if we can get closer to my initial counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is close to my initial counteroffer, and I'm happy to save $3,250 compared to buying from John. There's always the risk she might come down further, but I'm confident with this deal."
