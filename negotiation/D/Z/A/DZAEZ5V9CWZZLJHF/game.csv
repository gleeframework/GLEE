"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $85?  That's my top price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $85. I understand it's a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I can offer it to you for $100. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
