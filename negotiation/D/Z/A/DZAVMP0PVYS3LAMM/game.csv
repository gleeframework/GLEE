"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair compromise given the value you're seeking.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. This is the best I can do.",13000.0,Alice,5,
