""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting a price that yields a high profit for you."
