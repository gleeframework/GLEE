"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could potentially get a lower price by rejecting and negotiating with Alice, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential savings."
