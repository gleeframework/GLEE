Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering a price significantly higher than your minimum is a good strategy. It allows room for negotiation and gives you a stronger position. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for both parties.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  The subsequent responses will depend on Bob's counteroffers and your assessment of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While it's lower than my initial offer, $900,000 is still above my minimum of $800,000.  This means there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for a better price:** There's a chance I can push Bob higher by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Selling to John for $800,000 is the safe option, but I believe there's a good chance of getting closer to my initial goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll need to decide on a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim to find a price that is both appealing to him and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise. This increases the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Highlighting the value:** Emphasizing the value of the product reinforces my position and justifies the price.
* **Positive framing:**  The message maintains a positive tone and encourages a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By offering $950,000, I'm aiming to strike a balance between securing a decent profit and reaching a deal with Bob. This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable chance to accept while still allowing me to potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. How about we meet at $920000? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $920,000 is only $30,000 away from my initial offer of $950,000.  This is a small difference, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that Bob might not budge further, and continuing to negotiate could result in him walking away entirely.
* **Time and effort:**  The negotiation has already gone on for a few rounds, and the time and effort required to potentially secure a higher price might not be worth it for a relatively small gain.

**Conclusion:**

Given the closeness of Bob's offer to my desired price and the potential risk of losing the deal, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable option. It allows me to secure a good profit while minimizing the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
