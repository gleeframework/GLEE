Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a bit lower than what I need to earn, but still higher than what it's worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects, it gives me a chance to see if he's willing to come up in his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try to get a better offer from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make a good profit. I'm willing to give Bob one more chance to increase his offer, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise one more time.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has not increased his offer enough, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
