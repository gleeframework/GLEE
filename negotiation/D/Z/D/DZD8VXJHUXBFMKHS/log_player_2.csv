"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $14,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the opportunity to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $12,500. I can do $13,500, which is as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  $13,500 is a better price for Bob than the $15,000 offered by John.
* **There's little room for further negotiation.** Bob's initial counteroffer of $12,500 was rejected.  Further negotiation might lead to more back and forth, but it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $13,500.  

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer to save money."
