"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your budget of $10,000.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm only willing to spend $10,000, I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay. This starts the negotiation at my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'll continue negotiating in hopes of getting a better price or can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my maximum, but still a significant discount from Alice's previous offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but have a limit. It's a reasonable midpoint, increasing the chance of acceptance while still securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating in the hopes of getting a lower price. If the price doesn't come down further, I can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. I'm offering a price closer to her last offer, showing that I'm taking her counteroffers seriously. This gives her a better chance of accepting, while still leaving some room for bargaining if she rejects. If she rejects, I'll consider buying from John, but hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this point."
