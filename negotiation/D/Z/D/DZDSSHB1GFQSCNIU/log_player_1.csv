Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept. Here's why:

* **High Price:** $9,500 is just below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, maximizing your potential earnings.
* **Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small amount of wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to make the sale to Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation."
