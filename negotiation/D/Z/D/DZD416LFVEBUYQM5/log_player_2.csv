"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $80 to us. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it could greatly benefit you. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product at $80, which is your maximum price. Since you know you can buy the same product from John for $80, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but there's no guarantee. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price."
