"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice further.  You can potentially get the price down closer to your desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying but are also trying to negotiate a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more with Alice. While $13,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still more than you want to pay. You could try a counteroffer closer to $12,500 again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
``` 

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are willing to compromise, but it's still below her offer. It's a good way to show that you are serious about buying but are willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is now higher than your initial target price of $12,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that you could end up paying even more or running out of rounds. It's more secure to buy the product from John at your desired price."
