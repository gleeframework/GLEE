I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still leaving me a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for him, considering he's already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my bottom line, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway again, but still giving me a good profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal.  I'm willing to accept this price, but I'm not going to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my bottom line, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lower the price.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to have gotten closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to risk losing out on the opportunity altogether."
