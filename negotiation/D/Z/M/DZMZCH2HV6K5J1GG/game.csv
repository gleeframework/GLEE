"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $975,000 is still below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
