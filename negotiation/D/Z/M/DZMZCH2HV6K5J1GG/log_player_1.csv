Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While I need to sell it for at least $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 yet, especially since Bob admitted he sees the value."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push him a bit further before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But $975,000 is still below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,012,500 is still above my minimum threshold and it ensures I close the deal with Bob. It's better to get a good price now rather than risk a lower offer or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
