Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his estimated value, especially if the product is unique or hard to find.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below my absolute bottom line ($15,000) allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **High but Justifiable:**  $14,999 is a high price, but by emphasizing the product's value and being open to questions, I can try to convince Bob it's worth the investment. 

**Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for $15,000, still meeting my minimum.

**Best Case:** Bob accepts the offer, and I gain an additional $1 from my initial reserve price."
