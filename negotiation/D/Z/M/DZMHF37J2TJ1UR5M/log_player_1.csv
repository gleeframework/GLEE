Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While brief, the message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can consider a counter-offer or proceed with John."
