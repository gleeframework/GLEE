"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $100? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a compromise I think we can both agree on.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm sure you'll still be getting a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I've already offered $100, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that I'll have to look elsewhere for this product. I'd be willing to meet you at $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",105.0,Bob,6,
