Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value, also your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees enough value to accept. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value makes the deal attractive to him while still netting you a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The language is positive, emphasizing value and exclusivity to make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 profit margin, a strong incentive to buy.  You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your $1,000,000 minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You could try negotiating even higher, but be aware that getting too greedy might lead Bob to reject the deal."
