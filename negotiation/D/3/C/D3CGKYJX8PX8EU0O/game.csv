"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still higher than I can go right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're set on $9,000. However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. ",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,000 one more time.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us, but if we can't reach an agreement I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",10000.0,Alice,7,
