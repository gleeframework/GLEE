"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still more than your budget, so rejecting the offer is the best choice.  You can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, you still have room to negotiate and can potentially get it for closer to your target price of $8,000.  It's worth pushing for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still higher than I can go right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're set on $9,000. However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your goal price, but you're still not quite there. Keep pushing for a lower price. You only have five rounds left, so you want to make sure you're getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,000 one more time.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us, but if we can't reach an agreement I'll need to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is sticking to her price, and with only three rounds left, it's unlikely you'll get her to budge further. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. You'll still get the product you want and save time and energy."
