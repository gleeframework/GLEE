"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay more than $8,000. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum target of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm reducing my price by $1,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum target. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still higher than I can go right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While selling for $9,000 is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my goal.  I have more rounds to work with, and I'm confident that I can convince Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $9,000. However, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm continuing to be flexible, but I'm still aiming to get a higher price.  Splitting the difference with Bob might be a good way to get him to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,000 one more time.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us, but if we can't reach an agreement I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm sticking with $10,000, emphasizing my willingness to compromise but also highlighting my need to secure a decent price.  I'm hoping that this will motivate Bob to finally agree, but I'm also preparing him for the possibility of me moving on to John if he doesn't."
