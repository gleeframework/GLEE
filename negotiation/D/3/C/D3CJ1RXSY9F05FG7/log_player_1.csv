"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's high, but it leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob that you value the product and are willing to compromise.  It also provides a buffer in case Bob makes a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. I'm coming down from my initial price but still leaving some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject and try to push for a slightly higher price. There are still rounds remaining and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

I'm making another small concession, but this time I'm only dropping by $25,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal done, but I'm not willing to give up too much more.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  I've come down significantly from my initial asking price, but I'm still getting more than I would from selling to John.  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a deal with Bob is too high."
