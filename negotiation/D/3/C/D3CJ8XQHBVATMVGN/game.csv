"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential return on investment I'll see.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
