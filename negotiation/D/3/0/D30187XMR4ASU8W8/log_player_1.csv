"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and would be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's closer to your desired value ($8,000) but still leaves room for bargaining. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8800. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum value ($8,000), you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. You've already established a willingness to negotiate, and you have 8 more rounds to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,150?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8900. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only $100 less than your previous counteroffer, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating. You've already shown flexibility and demonstrated your willingness to compromise. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're still committed to achieving a higher price and increase the chances of him coming closer to your desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
