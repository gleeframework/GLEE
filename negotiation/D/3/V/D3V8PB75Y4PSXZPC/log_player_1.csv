{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,500 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High Anchor:** This price acts as a strong anchor point, making Bob more receptive to a price slightly lower than his maximum valuation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
