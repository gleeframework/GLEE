"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
