"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and the value it would bring to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
