{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $50 is a great price, but I'm aiming to save even more. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 30% lower than Alice's initial offer. This is aggressive, but I have 9 rounds left to negotiate and still have the option to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $40, which is a decent price considering my initial goal of $120.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid any further negotiation."
