"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to acquire a product that holds value for my business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is aggressive but within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. It shows a willingness to be serious but not completely unreasonable.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the potential value for both parties, aiming to make Alice consider the deal's long-term benefits. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, leaving room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a significant profit, while also being closer to your target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your target price, and you have 7 rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price by making a counteroffer. While Alice has shown some flexibility, there's still room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This would allow you to still make a healthy profit while keeping the deal within my budget. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefits:** The message again highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, emphasizing the profit Alice would still make. 
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer is getting closer to Alice's price point, implying that further concessions might be limited. This could encourage Alice to consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value of the product. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. You have 5 rounds left, but it's unlikely that you can get a much better price.  The risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings."
