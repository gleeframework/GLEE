Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any lower. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Explanation:

Alice is firm on her price and has stated this is her final offer.  While closer to your goal, it's still above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. There's no point in further negotiation if you're not willing to pay more than John's price."
