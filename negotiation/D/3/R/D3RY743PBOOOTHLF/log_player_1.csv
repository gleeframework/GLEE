I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen to buy the product but $1,100,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
