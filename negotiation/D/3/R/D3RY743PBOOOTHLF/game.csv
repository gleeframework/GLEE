"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen to buy the product but $1,100,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any lower. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
