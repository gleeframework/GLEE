{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value of the product and the good deal I'm offering.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation and willing to hear Bob's counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my assessment of the situation."
