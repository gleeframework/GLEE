"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,250,000?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This offer represents a significant saving for me while still giving you a fair price for your product. Let me know what you think.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
