Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value. This can help build rapport and increase the likelihood of Bob making a counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I can hopefully negotiate closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob rejects the offer outright, it might indicate he's not genuinely interested. 
* **Open the door for counteroffers:** By being open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to participate and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the [product description].  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on the sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  I'm already at my minimum acceptable price.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer, or Bob could walk away altogether.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation, saving time and effort.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed with the sale to Bob and finalize the transaction."
