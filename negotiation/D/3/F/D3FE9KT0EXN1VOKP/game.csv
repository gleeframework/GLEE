Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $110, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
