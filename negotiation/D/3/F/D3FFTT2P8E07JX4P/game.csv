"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you do $1,150,000?  That would work much better for my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to find a compromise. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're motivated to sell, and I'm still very interested in the product. Would you be willing to settle at $1,200,000?  That's my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
