"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree this product is fantastic, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Could you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $16,000. How about we compromise at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?  That's my final offer.",11750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,750. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. It's the best I can do, and I hope you can understand",13000.0,Alice,7,
