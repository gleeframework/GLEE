"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,600.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10700.0,Alice,5,
