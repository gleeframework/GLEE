Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at that price? "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is still a compromise, but it keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price while remaining potentially appealing to Bob. I'm also emphasizing the need for a fair price for both of us, which might help persuade him."
