"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $20,000.  This is significantly higher than Bob's valuation. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible while still securing the product. Starting with a counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $20,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's valuation of $15,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. Buying from John at this point would be a loss for Bob since he can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $15,000.  Offering $14,000 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product while still trying to save money. This offer is also a significant step closer to Alice's last offer of $18,000, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price. However, Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible and see if he can negotiate an even better price.  There is still room for negotiation and potentially getting a better deal than $16,000. Buying from John would be a loss for Bob since he can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final push to get Alice closer to Bob's desired price. By offering $15,500, Bob shows a willingness to compromise, but also sets a firm limit that's very close to his valuation. This approach aims to put pressure on Alice to accept the offer, as it's only a small difference from her previous offer and closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now lowered her price to $15,200. This is only $200 above Bob's valuation and a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject and then raise the price again, or Bob might run out of rounds. Accepting Alice's offer at this point maximizes Bob's savings and secures the product."
