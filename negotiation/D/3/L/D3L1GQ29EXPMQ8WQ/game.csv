"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $22000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is a great compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly.",12000.0,Bob,4,
