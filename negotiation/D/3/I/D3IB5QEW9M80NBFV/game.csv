"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $950,000, which would be $887,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find common ground, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the midpoint between $850,000 and $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm  limited by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,9,
