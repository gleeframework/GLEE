"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high. While she is willing to meet halfway, it's still above your budget and you have more rounds to negotiate. It's worth trying a counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $950,000, which would be $887,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $887,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. You have five rounds left, which means there's still room to negotiate. It's worth making a counteroffer to see if you can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find common ground, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the midpoint between $850,000 and $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than your budget. You have three rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate a better price. It's worth making a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price without having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm  limited by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still above your budget. With only one round left, the chance of negotiating further is slim. While you could make another counteroffer, the risk is high that Alice will reject it, leaving you with no options but to buy from John at $1,200,000.  

It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, as it's the most reliable option to secure the product within the remaining time."
