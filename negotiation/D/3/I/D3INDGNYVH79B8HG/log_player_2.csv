{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's worth exploring if a counteroffer can get the price down to a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your product's quality, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for this product, considering its value to me. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try and accommodate your needs while still valuing the product's true worth, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1500000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's quality and the value it can bring to you. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations, and I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can meet closer to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your patience in this negotiation. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $1200000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the product's value and your budgetary constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and enables us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still not ideal. Bob should try to push for a lower price, as there's still room for negotiation. He can consider buying from John as a fallback option, but it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiation. I hope we can reach a final agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I've reviewed our conversation and considered your latest offer. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to offer the product at $1150000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between the product's value and your budget. I hope this offer is acceptable and paves the way for a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but there's still a small gap. Bob should try to push for a lower price by making a counteroffer and seeing if Alice will budge further. It's a gamble, as he might risk losing the deal entirely.  However, with only a few rounds left, it's worth trying to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to both of us.  I hope we can finally reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions and aiming for a fair solution, I propose a final offer of $1140000 for the product. This price represents a reasonable compromise that respects both the product's value and your budgetary considerations. I hope this offer is agreeable and allows us to conclude this negotiation successfully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,140,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

With only one round left, it's a risky move to keep negotiating.  While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob can secure the product for a guaranteed lower price by buying from John. It's the safest option, as continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely with no guarantee of a better price."
