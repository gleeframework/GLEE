"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you, given its potential to reach a $1,500,000 value. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is fair given its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I'm aiming for a price closer to  $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're aiming for a lower price, $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from the deal, and it's a significant step closer to your target.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
