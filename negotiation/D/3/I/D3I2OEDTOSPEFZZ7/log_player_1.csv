Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you, given its potential to reach a $1,500,000 value. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,250,000, which I believe is fair given its worth to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a significant step up from my minimum ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, aiming to increase his desire to acquire the product.
* **Fairness:**  I'm positioning the offer as fair, acknowledging that both parties benefit from the deal. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses. 
* **Avoid immediate risk:**  The fallback option of selling to John provides a safety net, reducing the pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I'm aiming for a price closer to  $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than the product's value to him ($1,500,000) and less than my desired price. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can signal my willingness to continue the negotiation process and potentially achieve a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not in a rush. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand you're aiming for a lower price, $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from the deal, and it's a significant step closer to your target."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, subtly pressuring him to consider a higher price.
* **Framing it as a Win-Win:** I'm framing the offer as a way for both of us to benefit, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This approach:

* **Maintains a higher price point:**  $1,150,000 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Signals flexibility:** It shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation while not completely conceding.
* **Sets the stage for the next round:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have room to adjust my counteroffer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to agree to $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price of $1,150,000. 
* **Minimal difference:**  The difference between his offer and my last counteroffer is only $25,000. Further negotiation may be time-consuming and lead to a stalemate.
* **Risk of losing a good deal:**  By rejecting this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to settle for John's lower offer.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a price that's close to my target and avoids potential losses from further negotiation."
