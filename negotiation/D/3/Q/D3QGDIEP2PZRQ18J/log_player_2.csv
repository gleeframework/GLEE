# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is your best price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $10,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $8,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's likely that further negotiation won't get her down to your desired price. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $8,000."
