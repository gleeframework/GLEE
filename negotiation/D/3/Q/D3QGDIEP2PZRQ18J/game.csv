"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is your best price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $10,500. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
