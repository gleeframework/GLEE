"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  How about we compromise at $1750000? This still gives you a great deal and allows me to get a fair price for my product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
