"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you have a budget, and while I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,250? Let's make this work!",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my absolute limit.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
