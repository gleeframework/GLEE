"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let me know your thoughts.",14250.0,Alice,5,
