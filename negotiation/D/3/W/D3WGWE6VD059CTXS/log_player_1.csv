Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **The message:**  This message is friendly and professional. It highlights the value of the product without being pushy.  It also leaves the door open for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room to negotiate. This allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  The higher the starting price, the more room I have to negotiate down.
* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:** This offer will tell me if Bob is seriously interested in buying at a price close to my desired price.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** By mentioning the possibility of selling to John, I subtly imply that I may not have much time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $900,000.  This price gives you a great deal and still allows me a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own profit.
* **The Message:** The message is positive and focuses on the benefits of this price for both of us.  It's also clear and concise, leaving no room for ambiguity.

**Strategy:**

* **Pushing for a higher price:** This counteroffer maintains a price close to my desired target, showing Bob I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining a sense of urgency:** The message emphasizes closing the deal, implying that I may not be open to further negotiation.
* **Showing flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I need to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

At this point:

* **The potential for a higher price is limited.**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's clear he's not going to budge much further.
* **The risk of losing the deal is high.**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away and I'll be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price.

**Strategy:**

It's time to accept the offer.  While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's a solid deal that secures a profit.  I'll need to carefully consider my next negotiation strategy if I encounter similar situations in the future."
