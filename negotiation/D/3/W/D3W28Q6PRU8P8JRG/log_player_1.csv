Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I don't want to give away the product for too cheap, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 10500}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"

{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see how he responds!"
