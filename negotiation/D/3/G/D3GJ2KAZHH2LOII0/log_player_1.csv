"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Price:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely too high for Bob. This sets a strong baseline and allows for room to negotiate down. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value to Bob, reminding him of the potential profit he could make. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm expressing willingness to negotiate, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price. There are still more rounds available, and I don't want to settle for less if I can potentially get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than his, but lower than my initial offer.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize that my offer is a compromise to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, highlighting the potential profit.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting that we meet in the middle to further encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,600,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.  The risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and ending up with nothing is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and close the deal."
