"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its worth to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's true value, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, Alice. I think we can find a sweet spot between $900,000 and $1,000,000. How about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to be comfortable with the price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm feeling generous today and willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will lead to a successful transaction.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",990000.0,Bob,6,
