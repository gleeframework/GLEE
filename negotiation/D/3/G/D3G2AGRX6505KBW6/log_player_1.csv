"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, creating a dialogue. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's initial interest while leaving space for bargaining in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial counteroffer is unreasonable, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, but I'm aiming for a better deal. I want to explore if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is far too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-argument:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but directly counter it by stating the product's worth. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I'm offering a significant price reduction from my initial offer ($1,800,000) to show flexibility and demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I highlight the value Bob will be getting, further justifying the price.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to establish a more realistic price range while maintaining a strong position. It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's necessary to secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for anything less.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Not yet ready for John:** Selling to John is an option, but I want to maximize my profit. If I reject Bob's offer, I can potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, attempting to find a price that both parties are willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This offer is fair and gives you a significant advantage.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my counteroffer.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Compromise & Advantage:**  I highlight that the new offer is a ""significant advantage"" for Bob, suggesting a win-win scenario.

**Next Steps:**  This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap while still maintaining a favorable price. I hope Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1300000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is adamant about his offer of $1,000,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, leaving limited rounds to negotiate a higher price.
* **John offers a secure deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is my minimum threshold. It's a safe and reliable option.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
