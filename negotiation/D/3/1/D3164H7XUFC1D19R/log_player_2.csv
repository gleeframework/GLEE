"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you. My initial price is $1,150,000, which leaves room for negotiation. Let's talk! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting price is significantly above her value for the product. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a price much closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,020,000 for the product. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Appear serious:** By offering a specific price and framing it as fair, we signal serious interest while leaving room for further negotiation.

We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,020,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,085,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price, $1,085,000 is still significantly above her value.  We're making progress, but it's too early to settle. Rejecting again keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to a reasonable price. We have ample room for negotiation before reaching our walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,085,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,040,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the market value of similar products."",
""product_price"": 1040000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual increase:**  We are slowly increasing our offer to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* **Market justification:** By mentioning the market value, we subtly introduce an external factor to support our position.  
* **Staying below her offer:** Our offer remains substantially below Alice's previous offer, signaling that we are willing to walk away if necessary.

We'll continue to analyze Alice's responses and adjust our approach accordingly, always keeping in mind our walkaway alternative of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm doing the same.  I'm willing to go down to $1,060,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but $1,060,000 is still a significant markup from Alice's value. With 5 rounds remaining, we have room to push for a better deal. The risk of Alice walking away is increasing, but the potential savings outweigh that risk at this point. We will continue with a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,030,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to offer $1,045,000 to finalize the deal. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on it."",
""product_price"": 1045000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** We are increasing our offer marginally to demonstrate a willingness to move towards a deal but remain firm in our position.
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating our desire to finalize the deal, we introduce a subtle sense of urgency without appearing desperate.
* **Final offer positioning:** This offer sets us up to potentially accept anything below $1,055,000 in the next round or two, depending on Alice's response.

We are getting close to a critical point in the negotiation. Alice might accept this offer, counter with a price closer to our target, or become more resistant to further negotiation. We must be prepared to adjust our approach based on her response."
