```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,020,000 for the product. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,020,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,085,000?  This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 1085000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,085,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,040,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,040,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter Bob's offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm doing the same.  I'm willing to go down to $1,060,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to offer $1,045,000 to finalize the deal. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,045,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,045,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that we're running out of time.  It's better to secure a solid deal now than risk losing out to John or further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a better outcome."
