"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000 to demonstrate my desire to work with you.  This represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair starting point.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1300000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product. I'm eager to finalize this deal and hope you'll consider my counteroffer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a substantial discount and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1150000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  we're getting closer, but $1150000 just doesn't work for me.  To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This is a fair price point that balances both our needs.  I'm confident we can find a resolution at this price.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
