"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1300000 to demonstrate my desire to work with you.  This represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product. I'm eager to finalize this deal and hope you'll consider my counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a substantial discount and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save money. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can likely secure a better deal by rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting closer, but $1150000 just doesn't work for me.  To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1175000. This is a fair price point that balances both our needs.  I'm confident we can find a resolution at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. Although Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, he can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He has already rejected a price higher than this, so he's showing a willingness to work but is still aiming for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still slightly above my budget. To make this work, I'm offering $1,160,000. This is a fair price that balances both our needs.  I'm confident we can find a resolution at this price."", ""product_price"": 1160000}
