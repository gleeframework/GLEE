{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. It also establishes a positive tone and highlights the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure I receive a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100?  This still leaves room for you to save compared to my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make one last counteroffer before considering selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will realize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob's offer of $92.50, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'll sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further back-and-forth with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge significantly from his position."
