"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $100?  This still leaves room for you to save compared to my initial offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $97.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen!",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",92.5,Bob,6,
