# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While $125 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with your better alternative."
