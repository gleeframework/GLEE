Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's above Bob's perceived value but potentially appealing if he values the convenience of getting it immediately. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still get a fair price.
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  Offering it at $150 to Bob is likely to be rejected outright, as it's significantly higher than his perceived value. Offering it too low (close to $100) leaves potential profit on the table."
