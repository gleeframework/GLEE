"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation as well.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significant to me, and $1,000,000 doesn't fully reflect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
