"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your valuation as well."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significant to me, and $1,000,000 doesn't fully reflect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer. This price allows Bob to buy the product for a good price while still securing the product. Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be more expensive."
