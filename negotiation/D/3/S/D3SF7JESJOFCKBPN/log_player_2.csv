"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant amount over your ideal price. 
* **Negotiation is worth it.** There are 9 more rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  If negotiations fail, you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** By offering $100, you show Alice you're serious about getting a lower price but leave room for negotiation.
* **Midpoint approach:**  $100 is the midpoint between Alice's offer of $120 and your ideal price of $80.  
* **Consider the rounds:** You have several rounds left to negotiate, so you're not forced to settle immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $110 is still outside your ideal price range.
* **You have more negotiation power.**  You've shown you're willing to walk away, and with 7 rounds remaining, you have time to continue bargaining.
* **John's offer is still a viable backup.** You're not desperate to close the deal, so you can keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:**  By offering $95, you show Alice you're willing to compromise but also that you're not willing to pay her asking price.
* **Approaching your ideal price:** You're getting closer to your target of $80. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  With multiple rounds remaining, you can still reject Alice's counteroffers if she doesn't come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $105 is still more than your ideal price, but it's within your limit of $150.
* **Negotiation is getting tough:**  Alice has been stubborn, and with only 5 rounds left, it's becoming riskier to continue pushing.
* **Time is a factor:** The longer you negotiate, the more likely it is that you'll lose the deal altogether. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You're still covered if you need to buy from John, but this deal is getting closer to your ideal price."
