"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* It's important to leave some room for negotiation so that Bob doesn't feel like he's being taken advantage of. 
* This strategy aims to quickly gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price early on."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000, it's still significantly less than the value I'm aiming for.
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to budge. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.** However, I want to explore all options with Bob first, as I believe I can get a better price from him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is still well below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 but closer to my target price of $1,200,000. 
* This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still attempting to get a good deal. It also gives Bob room to negotiate further. 
* This strategy is a balancing act between potentially closing the deal quickly and maximizing my profit."

* **Testing the waters:** This offer is close to Bob's latest offer, testing whether he's willing to move up a bit.
* **Remaining strategic:**  I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, as there's still some potential to maximize my profit without jeopardizing the deal."

* **Selling to John is a viable option.** However,  I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and come to a reasonable agreement. 
* **Final push for a better deal:** With only a few rounds left, I'm making a last effort to see if Bob will budge a bit. I believe there's still potential for a slightly better price.
* **Weighing the risks:**  If Bob rejects this offer, selling to John for $800,000 is a viable option, but I'm still hoping to secure a higher price."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're down to our last two rounds, and there's a high chance Bob will reject any counteroffer I make, especially with him offering my minimum price. 
* **No room for negotiation:**  Bob is firm at my minimum price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. It's the most logical decision given the current situation. 

It's important to remember that maximizing profit is a key objective, but sometimes it's better to secure a guaranteed sale than risk losing out entirely."
