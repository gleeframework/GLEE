"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $131. I'm willing to make one last offer - $130. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $150. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,10,
