Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting at $925,000 ensures a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
