"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close a deal, $75 is below my minimum threshold.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $78.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is not budging much, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation. I don't want to risk another rejection and lose out on a guaranteed sale with John."
