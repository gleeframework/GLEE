"Bob, $500,000 is far too low. I understand you have a budget, but this product is worth significantly more. How about $1,200,000? It's a fair price considering the value it provides.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,200,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
