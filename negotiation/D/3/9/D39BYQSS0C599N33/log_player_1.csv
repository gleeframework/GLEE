Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not scare Bob away.  Here's an offer that balances these goals:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""exceptional product"" and ""fair deal"" reinforce the product's value.
* **Focus on ROI:**  By highlighting ""return on investment,"" you shift Bob's focus from the upfront cost to the long-term benefits.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! You've maximized your profit.
* **Bob Counters:** This opens up negotiations. Be prepared to go lower, but not below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You have John as a backup, ensuring you meet your minimum selling price. 

**Important:**  Negotiation is a fluid process. Observe Bob's reactions and adjust your approach accordingly."
