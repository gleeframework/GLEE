Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While the product is worth $80 to Bob, I start with a price significantly lower than John's offer ($150) but higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies value by mentioning it's a ""fantastic product"" and I'm making a sacrifice (""willing to part with it"").
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering it at $125, I'm aiming for a price that's appealing to Bob (much lower than $150) while still securing a significant profit for myself. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering Bob's potential acceptance."
