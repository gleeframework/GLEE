Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if I can get a higher price. However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $150."
