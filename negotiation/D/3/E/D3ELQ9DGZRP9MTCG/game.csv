"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it holds. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings to the table is substantial.  I could let it go for $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
