"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  This product would be great, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a much lower offer than Alice's asking price. This establishes a negotiation stance and leaves room to move up.
* **Not Too Low:** While starting low, $700,000 is still a reasonable jump from my absolute maximum of $800,000. It might be tempting to go even lower, but I want to avoid insulting Alice and potentially killing the deal. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer gives me space to negotiate upwards if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $700,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, but it's still significantly above my maximum price of $800,000.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice moved down a considerable amount, which suggests there's still flexibility in her position. I want to see if I can push her closer to my target.
* **Backup Plan:** I have the option to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $775,000.  Does that work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 775000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only by a smaller amount this time ($75,000). This signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on getting a good price.
* **Getting Closer:** $775,000 is getting very close to my maximum budget. If Alice rejects this, I may have to consider John's offer more seriously.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge how much more Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's firm at $950,000 or higher, I'll know it's time to move on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I can tell you're serious about this product.  To meet you closer to the middle, how about $875,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to John:** While $875,000 is a significant price drop from Alice's original offer, it's only slightly better than John's price of $800,000. 
* **Final Push:** I'm going to make one last attempt to get closer to $800,000. If Alice isn't budging further, I'll take John's offer. 
* **Limited Risk:** By rejecting, I risk Alice walking away. However, she's clearly motivated to sell, and I have a strong fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I can do $800,000 for this product.  That's the absolute best I can offer."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm matching John's price. This sends a strong signal that I'm serious, and it's my final offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** By stating it's my best offer, I'm applying a bit of time pressure. Alice knows I have another option and may lose the sale if she doesn't accept.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice will walk away, but the potential reward of saving $75,000 is significant enough to take that risk."
