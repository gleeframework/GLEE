Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,250,000. This is a midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Message:** I've kept the message concise and positive, highlighting the value for Bob and emphasizing the deal aspect.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** It's unlikely I'll get my full asking price, but this strategy has a high chance of success with Bob. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  Even if Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer who will pay my desired price.

This approach balances the need to earn as much money as possible with the risk of losing a deal."
