Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, I'm starting at $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits for Bob and emphasizes a ""fair"" price for both parties. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering $12,000, I'm anticipating Bob might counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John lined up for $15,000, so I'm not desperate and can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there is room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a sure thing, I want to explore if I can secure a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? That's still a good value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm not meeting Bob exactly halfway, but I'm offering a significant concession from my initial price. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing that $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** By offering $10,500, I'm leaving space for another round of counteroffers if necessary. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** This offer is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That's the lowest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I don't want to waste time if I can secure a better deal elsewhere.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  I've reached a point where continuing the negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result. It's time to accept the guaranteed profit with John."
