"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Could we work with a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,280,000 and $1,220,000. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
