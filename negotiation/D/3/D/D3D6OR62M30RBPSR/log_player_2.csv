"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still above his maximum budget. He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a significant reduction, but still within the realm of possibility given that the product is worth $12,000 to Alice. He's aiming for a deal that benefits both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, $11,000 is still above his budget. He'll continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession but staying firm in his desire to keep the price below $11,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target price of $10,000. He should reject Alice's offer and see if he can squeeze out a little more in the next round.  He knows that John is offering the product for $10,000, so he has a solid fallback option.  He's willing to risk one more round to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $10,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm  prepared to offer $10,800. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground on this."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he's still not ready to accept. He's offering $10,800, which is only $100 away from his maximum budget. This counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about getting the price down, but he's also willing to be reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,800 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $10,750. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle on this one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his limit. While Alice has lowered her price significantly, she's still $750 above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice.  John's offer of $10,000 is a sure thing, and Bob can secure the product at his target price."
