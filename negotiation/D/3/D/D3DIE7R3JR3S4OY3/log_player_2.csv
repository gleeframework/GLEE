"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's not a good deal for you. You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice. There's no reason to buy immediately at the highest price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice an incentive to counter. It also reflects my strong desire to acquire the product but at a price that benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500. While it's still higher than my initial counteroffer, it's within my budget and a reasonable compromise. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and it's risky to continue.  It's more advantageous to accept this offer and secure the product than risk losing it and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
