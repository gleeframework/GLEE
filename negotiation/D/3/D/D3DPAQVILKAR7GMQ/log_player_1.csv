Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** You have the security of John's offer ($10,000) if Bob rejects your initial proposal."
