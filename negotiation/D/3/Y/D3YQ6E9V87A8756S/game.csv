"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $120 to $110, and now you're asking for another $5 off. I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",108.0,Alice,3,
