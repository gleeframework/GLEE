"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning that I think Bob would appreciate the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's good to know that he's interested.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $120 to make this deal happen.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing him completely, especially as we're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds.  $110 is a decent profit, and I can always try to sell to John later if this falls through."
