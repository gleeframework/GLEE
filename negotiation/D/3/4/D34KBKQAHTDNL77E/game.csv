"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway?  Would you consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000? That would be a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
