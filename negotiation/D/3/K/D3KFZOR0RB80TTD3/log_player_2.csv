{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is $30 higher than Bob's maximum price.  It's worth negotiating further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still $10 higher.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only had three rounds so far, leaving plenty of opportunity to find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while potentially pushing Alice closer to Bob's desired price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is now only $5 more than Bob's maximum price, he's still aiming to save as much money as possible. He has several rounds left, and there's a chance he can convince Alice to go lower. It's also worth noting that if Bob rejects this offer and Alice doesn't come down in price, he can always buy from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final offer. He's reached his maximum price point, and any further negotiation would be pointless. If Alice rejects, Bob can confidently buy the product from John for the same price. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept the deal, but Bob is prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
