It's time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Getting Close to John's Price:**  Alice is down to $720,000.  You're rapidly approaching the point where continuing the negotiation might not yield much more savings and could risk losing the deal.
* **Time is a Factor:**  You're on Round 7. While you have a few rounds left, the longer this goes on, the less likely Alice is to drop her price significantly.
* **A Good Deal Overall:**  While $720,000 is more than John's offer, you've successfully negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price."
