"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [Product Name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for $150, and that's the maximum you're willing to pay, it makes sense to accept her offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
