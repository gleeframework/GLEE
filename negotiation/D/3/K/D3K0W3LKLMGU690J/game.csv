"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1225000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1225000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1300000? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
