Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $15000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  $10,000 is my minimum, but I'm hoping for more."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $12,500?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12500 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $11000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I still think I can get more than $11,000."
