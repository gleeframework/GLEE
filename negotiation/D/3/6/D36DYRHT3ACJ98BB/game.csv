"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. This is the lowest price I can go, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to the middle.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too pricey for me. Would you consider $75?  That would be a fair compromise in my opinion.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $110. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
