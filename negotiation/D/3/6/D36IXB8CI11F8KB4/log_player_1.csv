Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Since I know John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm going to offer Bob the same price. While this might seem like a risky move, it maximizes my potential earnings. 

Here's why:

* **Best Case:**  Bob accepts the offer. I get the full $1,200,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer.  I still sell to John for $1,200,000.

There's no downside to offering the full price to Bob, as I'm guaranteed to make my minimum desired profit."
