"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's try to close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $115. I think that's the best price I can give you, considering the product's value to me.",115.0,Alice,5,
