Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's better to sell to John at a price that meets my minimum than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting an even lower offer."
