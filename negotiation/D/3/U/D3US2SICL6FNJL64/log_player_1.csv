"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me leverage. 
* **Positive and engaging:** I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** While I'm starting high, I'm not making an unreasonable offer. I'm open to negotiation and hope Bob will engage with a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of at least $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to make this deal work. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer that is closer to his initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and allows for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value and point out that my counteroffer is still fair. 
* **Positive language:** I use positive language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. This offer is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Even though he's called it his ""final offer"", I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still significantly less than the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridge the gap:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product. My counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fair compromise:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal for both parties, suggesting a win-win situation. 
* **Encourage agreement:**  I'm using positive language and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1600000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been insistent on his price of $1,250,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would like to get a better deal, I don't want to risk further negotiations dragging on and potentially losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome that meets my minimum price point."
