"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2000000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to make this deal work. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. This offer is my final offer, let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still significantly less than the value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This offer is a fair compromise and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1600000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
