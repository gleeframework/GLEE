"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and that's the price I'm willing to pay.",80.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, so how about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
