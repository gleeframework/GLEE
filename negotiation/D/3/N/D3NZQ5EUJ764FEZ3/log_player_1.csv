Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999.  I believe it offers exceptional value and would be a great investment for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it just below my guaranteed price from John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Urgency:** By making a slightly lower offer, I might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly rather than trying to negotiate further.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a near-optimal price and ensuring I don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
