"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle around $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer.  This allows you to acquire the product at a price that still provides you with a good return on your investment. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $1,125,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
