Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
