"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000. There are 10 rounds and John is offering a better price, so it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,280,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still a bit higher.  You have 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John for a lower price. It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,280,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go.  I'm willing to offer you $1,260,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1260000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,270,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $1,200,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you only have 5 rounds left.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get Alice to come down to your target price in that time. Since John is offering a price that meets your budget, it's the best course of action to buy from him now and avoid further negotiation."
