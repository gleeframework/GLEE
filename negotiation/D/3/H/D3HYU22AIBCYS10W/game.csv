"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it's within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,280,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1280000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,280,000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to go.  I'm willing to offer you $1,260,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1260000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,270,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
