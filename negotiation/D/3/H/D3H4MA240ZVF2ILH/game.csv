"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $725,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $725,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $812,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",812500.0,Alice,5,
