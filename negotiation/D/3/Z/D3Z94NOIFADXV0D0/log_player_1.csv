"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value might make Bob more willing to consider a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any) or his decision to reject. I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is showing interest, there's still room to negotiate.  
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $150 would be a safe option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll propose a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds based on Bob's reactions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from $175 to $140, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that $140 is still a fair price, considering the product's value. 
* **Middle Ground:**  My offer is a potential compromise point, setting the stage for further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze whether Bob accepts, rejects, or makes a new counteroffer.
* **Adaptability:** Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy, potentially making further concessions or maintaining my stance if necessary. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While he's showing willingness to compromise, it's not enough for me to accept yet.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer Still Available:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob breaks down.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll propose a counteroffer closer to $140, potentially offering a small concession while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** I'll emphasize the value of the product again, hoping to convince Bob to increase his offer.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I'll need to be strategic in my counteroffers to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $135.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession from my previous counteroffer of $140, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $135 is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using a positive tone and expressing a desire to close the deal, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider whether Bob accepts, rejects, or makes a new counteroffer.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, potentially making a final concession or holding firm depending on the situation.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, especially if the negotiations with Bob start to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $125. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to close the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, there's not enough time to push for a significantly higher price from Bob. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** I'll proceed with the sale to John for $150, as this is the most secure and profitable option at this point.
* **Ending Negotiations:** I'll politely inform Bob that I'm unable to accept his offer and will be selling the product to another buyer."
