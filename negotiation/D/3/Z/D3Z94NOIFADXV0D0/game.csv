"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $135.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $125. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to close the deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,6,
