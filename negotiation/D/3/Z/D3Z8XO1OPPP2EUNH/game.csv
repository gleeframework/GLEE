"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't want to go overboard. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
