Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,000 is significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,500, which I think is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,125?"", ""product_price"": 8125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but $8,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,750, which is the closest I can get to your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $8,000 in the remaining rounds. It's better to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
