"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,125?",8125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to compromise, but $8,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,750, which is the closest I can get to your original offer.",7750.0,Bob,6,
