"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $110. While this is a good price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $110 and my maximum willingness to pay of $120. This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also seeking a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within my acceptable range of $120.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject my next offer, or I could end up buying from John for $120. Accepting this offer guarantees me the product at a decent price."
