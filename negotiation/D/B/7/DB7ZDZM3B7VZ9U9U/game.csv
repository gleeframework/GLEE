"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $60 if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $100 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $80? That seems like a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $80 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
