Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think?

Round 4

""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $80 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $110 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $110, and we know we can get the product for $80 from John. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed good deal."
