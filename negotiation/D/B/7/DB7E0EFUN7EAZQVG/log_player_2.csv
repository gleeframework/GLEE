"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $90. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer. You're willing to pay up to $100, so you have some room for negotiation."
