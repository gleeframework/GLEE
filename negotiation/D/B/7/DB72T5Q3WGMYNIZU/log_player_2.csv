"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer."
