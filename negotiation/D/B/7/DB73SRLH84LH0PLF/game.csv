"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a number closer to my valuation. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern of significant counteroffers.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, $8,200 is too low.  To be frank, I'm very close to accepting another offer at my minimum.  If you can do $8,750, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to move on.",8750.0,Alice,5,
