Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin by anchoring the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) but below Bob's perceived value ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring I make a good profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining aware that I have a reliable backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to accept it immediately. There's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price slightly above my minimum to signal I'm willing to be flexible but want a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we settle at $125? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to his price. The $125 price point represents a compromise that could be appealing to both of us.
* **Final Offer Tone (Without Saying It):**  While not explicitly stating it's my final offer, the tone suggests I'm getting closer to my bottom line. This might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm still mindful that I have a guaranteed $100 from John. This knowledge gives me leverage and prevents me from feeling pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $120. Would you be willing to meet me at $123? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Enough Deal:** Bob's offer of $123 is only $2 less than my previous counteroffer. It's a strong profit margin above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might make Bob walk away, especially since he's budged multiple times already.  
* **Time Cost:** Further negotiation rounds take time and effort. Accepting the $123 offer now ensures a good profit without unnecessary delay."
