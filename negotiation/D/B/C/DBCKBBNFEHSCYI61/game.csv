"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly over my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 remains outside my budget. Given our shared goal of reaching an agreement, I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is as high as I can go while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while being a fair starting point for us to finalize a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $887,500 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.
