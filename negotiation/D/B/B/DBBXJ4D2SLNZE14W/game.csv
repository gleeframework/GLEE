"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $155 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'll meet you halfway between $155 and $140, which would be $147.50. What do you think?",147.5,Alice,5,
