Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you partway - how about $1,200,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but $1,100,000 is still underselling its worth.  My final offer is $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Waiting carries the risk of her withdrawing the offer entirely.  $1,150,000 is a significant savings over John's price, and it's within our budget."
