"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you partway - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,200,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down slightly more, but $1,100,000 is still underselling its worth.  My final offer is $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
