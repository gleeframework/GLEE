"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's my final offer. I'd love to make this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise.  This deal is still incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this now!",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's my final offer. I really like the product and would like to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,6,
