"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe will significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I am confident it will be a valuable addition to your business. Considering its intrinsic worth and the potential impact it can have on your endeavors, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product for $1,150,000. This price reflects a strategic compromise aimed at ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. I look forward to discussing the details further and exploring how we can collaborate to achieve mutual success. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, but it's still a significant markup from Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal. There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
