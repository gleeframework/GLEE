Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  The $20,000 offer helps gauge Bob's interest.  If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects it, you can always come down in price, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $15,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have time constraints or that John's offer is guaranteed to remain at $15,000."
