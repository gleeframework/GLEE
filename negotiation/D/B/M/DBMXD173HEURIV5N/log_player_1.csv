Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 initially gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  Mentioning Bob's potential appreciation for the product adds a bit of persuasion.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" signals I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Above Minimum:** $100 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, giving me a good starting point. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $120 as possible, without risking him walking away. This initial offer creates a space for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to lower offers from Bob or a prolonged process.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  There's a chance I could get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120 with more negotiation, but the risk of a worse outcome outweighs the potential reward. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $80 is still a viable option, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher profit.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision, as it provides a good profit with minimal risk."
