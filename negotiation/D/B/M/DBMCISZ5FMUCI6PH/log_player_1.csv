"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is a strong opening offer, aiming for a significant portion of Bob's potential value while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, but not so high that Bob immediately rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer, it's still far from the potential value of the product for Bob. It's worth pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it's tempting to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly more than John's offer and represents a good compromise. The risk of continuing negotiation is that Bob might walk away entirely."
