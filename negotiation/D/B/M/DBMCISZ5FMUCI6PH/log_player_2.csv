"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating but still leaves room for compromise.  The goal is to get Alice to budge closer to our ideal price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not in my ideal range. There's still more room for negotiation before I have to consider John's offer.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $950,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway. This is a good strategy to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price within my budget."
