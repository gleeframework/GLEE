"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still provides you with a significant value and allows me to move forward with the sale.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",775000.0,Bob,4,
