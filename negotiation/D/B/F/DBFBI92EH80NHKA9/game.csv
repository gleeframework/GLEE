"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it leaves room for us to find a middle ground. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's a significant profit for me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
