Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the potential value Bob will get, making the price more palatable.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for counteroffers while still establishing a strong starting point.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net, ensuring I can get my minimum if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer, $13,000 is still less than the $15,000 I'm willing to accept from John. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I can likely get closer to my target with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I have a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer to Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum, but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the benefits for both of us, making the offer more appealing. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while also protecting my interests."
