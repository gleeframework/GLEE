"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice has signaled that she won't go below $1,200,000, but there's still a $100,000 gap between her offer and John's price. It's worth one more try to negotiate a better deal before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. Let's make this work â€“ how about $1,225,000?"",

}
```

This counteroffer attempts to split the difference between Alice's minimum price and her current offer. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving compared to John's price."
