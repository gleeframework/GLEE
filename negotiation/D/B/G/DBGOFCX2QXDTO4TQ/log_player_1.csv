"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000 to $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not comfortable with Bob's offer of $900,000. While it's a move in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer of $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still unable to accept it at this time.

Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to remain above $1 million, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1100000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product's value warrants a higher price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to remain above $1,050,000. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,075,000.  This is a fair price, considering the unique potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1075000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1100000, which would be $1087500. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to meet me halfway,  $1,087,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm determined to get as close to my initial asking price as possible. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'm doing my best to work with that. However, I need to stay above $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1062500. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is the lowest I can go. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

This is a tough decision. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm going to take John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I get a sale and avoid further negotiation."
