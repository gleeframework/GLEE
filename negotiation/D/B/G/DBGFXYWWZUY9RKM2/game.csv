"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value of this product goes beyond typical market comparisons. Its unique features and potential for generating significant returns justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
