"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I think this is a reasonable compromise given the value I'll get from the product.",12800.0,Bob,4,
