"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a significant price point for me, but I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000. While you could reject it and buy from John, you would save $500 by accepting Alice's offer."
