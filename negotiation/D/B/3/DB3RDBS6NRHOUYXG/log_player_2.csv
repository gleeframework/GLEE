Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is my bottom line. This product is truly worth it, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's try to find common ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $10,875. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is getting closer, but you're still above your target price of $10,000.  John offers a guaranteed price within your budget, so it's the best choice to avoid any further risk of a price you're not comfortable with."
