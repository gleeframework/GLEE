"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is my bottom line. This product is truly worth it, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let's try to find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $10,875. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
