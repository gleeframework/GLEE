"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is selling it for, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
