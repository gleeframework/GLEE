"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $9,000 is a bold move, but it's within Bob's budget and signals a serious intent to negotiate.  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He rejected Alice's previous offer of $11,000 and is now offering $9,500, a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept as it's getting closer, Bob is determined to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and there's still a chance Alice might come down further or Bob might be able to secure a lower price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $10,000. This is a clear signal that he's serious about buying the product but won't go higher.  At this point, Alice has two options: accept the offer and close the deal, or risk losing the sale to John."
