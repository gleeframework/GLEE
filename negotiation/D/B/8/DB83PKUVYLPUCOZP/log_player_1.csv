Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we agree on $1,300,000? That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise, getting me closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal.  It's important to remember that I'm within the range of my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome, especially considering the time constraint of 10 rounds."
