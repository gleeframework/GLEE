"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I'm aiming for a profit. I believe he'll be willing to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still giving me some profit. I think this might be a sweet spot to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $128 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I want to avoid going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal.  I'm going to accept his offer."
