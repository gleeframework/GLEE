"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $12,800.** This is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($12,000), but it's less than what Bob could get it for from John ($15,000).
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely.**  Alice might decide to walk away, leaving Bob with the more expensive option from John.
* **Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's significantly cheaper than John's price.** This saves Bob $2,200. 

In this situation, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting the offer is the best way to secure a good deal and avoid losing the product altogether."
