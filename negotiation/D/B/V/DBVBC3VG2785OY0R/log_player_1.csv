Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could sell to John for $100, I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for the same amount, there's no reason to delay the sale. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
