Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to bargain and still reach a price that's very profitable for you.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"", you're subtly justifying the price without revealing your true minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation alive.

**Important Note:**  While John guarantees you $15,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob is strategic. Even if Bob counters with a lower offer, you're still in a good position to negotiate upwards from there."
