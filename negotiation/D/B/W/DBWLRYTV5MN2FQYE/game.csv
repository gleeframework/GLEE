"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $94.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $89? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",89.0,Bob,6,
