"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This creates room for negotiation while also showing I'm serious about selling.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob. 

This approach aims to initiate the negotiation by presenting a reasonable offer while leaving space for counter-offers and ultimately finding a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120. Since this is only the second round, I have more room to negotiate and don't want to settle too quickly.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter-offer with a price slightly above $90 but still below my minimum price. I'll aim for a price that keeps the negotiations moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $95 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate the value proposition of the product. By using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""fair price,"" I aim to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal.  The negotiation has progressed well, and I have 6 rounds remaining. I believe I can still get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer with a price slightly above $92 in the next round.  I'll try to find a middle ground that is both profitable for me and still acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $94.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $94 is a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise but still pushing towards my desired price. It's a reasonable middle ground.
* **Message:** I reiterate Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the product's value.  ""Fair price"" and ""sure you'll be happy"" aim to create a positive and collaborative tone.

**Reasoning:**

With five rounds remaining, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price than selling to John for $120.  This offer maintains a reasonable margin while giving Bob space to potentially accept or counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $94. Would you be willing to meet me at $89? I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $89 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  With only four rounds left, the negotiations are not progressing in my favor.  It's getting increasingly unlikely that I'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  

Instead of risking further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better outcome, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I meet my minimum price requirement."
