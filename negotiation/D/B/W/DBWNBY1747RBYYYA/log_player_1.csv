"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves plenty of room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, while still being within a range Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's current offer.  I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to profit significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good deal. It's well above my minimum price and I'm confident I can secure a better deal with a new buyer in the future."
