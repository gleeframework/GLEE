"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for the same price, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice. You might get a lower price, but you also risk losing the deal entirely.  It's safer and more efficient to buy from John."
