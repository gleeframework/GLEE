"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
