"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and still a good profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and gives you a fair price. Let's find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,062,500. This would still give you a good profit, and we can finally seal the deal.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,062,500 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $1,068,750. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal.",1068750.0,Alice,5,
