"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150, you know you have another option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of getting a better price, even if it means ultimately going with John's $150 offer."
