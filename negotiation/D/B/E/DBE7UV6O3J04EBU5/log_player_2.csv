Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiations.  It's a guaranteed deal within his budget."
