You can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."

I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice has already reduced her price significantly. While you could try another counteroffer, it's likely she'll be firm on this price. Accepting the offer for $1,125,000 saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
