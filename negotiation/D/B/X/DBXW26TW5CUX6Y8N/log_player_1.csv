"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", 
""product_price"": 160
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $140 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
