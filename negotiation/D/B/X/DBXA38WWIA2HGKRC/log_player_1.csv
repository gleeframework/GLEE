Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still below my minimum value, and I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your proposition, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is close enough to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John.  Let's close this deal."
