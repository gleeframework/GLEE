{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This is my initial offer. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum of $80. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $75 is a good offer, it's just below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a little and offer it to you for $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not happy to be selling to John for my minimum price,  Bob's offer of $78 is still too low.  It's better to secure the sale with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
