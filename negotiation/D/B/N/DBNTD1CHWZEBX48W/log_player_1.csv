Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is less than the product's value to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you are confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly.  You can also use John's offer of $800,000 as a reference point to make sure you don't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $1,200,000 and you know the product is worth more to him.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:** It ensures you don't go below your minimum price.
* **Highlights the product's value:**  It reminds Bob of the product's worth and the potential gain for him. 

By offering $1,000,000, you're signaling that you're open to a deal but not willing to settle for a price significantly below your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. 

Here's why:

* **Close to your desired price:**  $950,000 is not too far off from your initial asking price of $1,200,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob is willing to compromise, which is a good sign.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject the offer, there's no guarantee Bob will counteroffer again, and you might end up selling to John for a much lower price. 

It's important to weigh the potential of getting a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal entirely.  $950,000 is a solid deal that allows you to maximize your profits while securing a sale."
