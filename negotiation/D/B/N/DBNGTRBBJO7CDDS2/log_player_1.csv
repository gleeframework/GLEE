Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm willing to consider a serious offer from you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible without going below our minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,450,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet us closer to his valuation. 
* **Strong but Flexible Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Alice's desired price but shows a willingness to negotiate. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer.

**Why not go lower?**

While we know John will buy at $1,500,000, there's always a chance Bob might offer more than $1,200,000. Starting higher allows us to potentially capture more of the value difference."
