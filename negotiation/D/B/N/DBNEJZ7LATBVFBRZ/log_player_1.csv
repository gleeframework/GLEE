Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and hoping to build a positive rapport. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation down to a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  Bob's willingness to pay $12,000 means there's a good chance he'll counter.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation tone:**  A friendly approach can help keep the negotiation productive and lead to a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price even higher.  Selling to John for $8,000 is not a favorable option at this stage, as I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. I'm also subtly suggesting that $9,500 is a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get closer to my desired price:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to $10,000.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Avoid selling to John:**  I'm confident that I can reach a deal with Bob that's more profitable than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired price and only $250 less than my last offer. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's significantly higher than John's offer."
