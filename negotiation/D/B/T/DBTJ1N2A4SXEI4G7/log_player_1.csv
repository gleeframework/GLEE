"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and provide insight into his perceived value of the product.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind ($800,000) provides a safety net. I can always walk away if negotiations with Bob don't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired outcome. I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and attempt to reach a price closer to my initial ask. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** By coming down $100,000 from my initial offer, I signal flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to support the higher price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds, but I want to guide the negotiation toward a favorable outcome sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,050,000? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,050,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. Accepting shows I value his cooperation.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and ensures I receive the payment quickly.  

While there's a chance I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains seem less certain compared to the solid offer on the table."
