"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
