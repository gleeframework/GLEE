"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth at least $800,000. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential benefits it could bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I expected. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and I'm open to further negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
