# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is less than your maximum price, you know John will sell it to you for $12,000. There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further."
