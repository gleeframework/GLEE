Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and based on your needs, I think it could be very valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still positioning it as a valuable item. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth a ""significant amount"" and could be ""very valuable"" to Bob, you are creating a sense of value and exclusivity. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If he seems hesitant, you can always adjust your price closer to $10,000 to secure the sale."
