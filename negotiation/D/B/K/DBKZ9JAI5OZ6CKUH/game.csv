"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, based on my initial research and understanding of its value. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $600000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700000 is still a bit high for my budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to offer $650000. This reflects a significant move from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this unique product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
