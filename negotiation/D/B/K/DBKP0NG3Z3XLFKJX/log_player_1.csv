Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum acceptable price.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has some leverage and that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product. 
* If Alice is unsure about Bob's interest, a slightly lower starting price might be more effective."
