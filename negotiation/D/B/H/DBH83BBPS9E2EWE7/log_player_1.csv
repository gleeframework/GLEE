Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I also want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175.  This is still a good price for me, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my offer to $160. This is a significant concession, but it's my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $150."
