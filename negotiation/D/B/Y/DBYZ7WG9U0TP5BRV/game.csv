"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $115 is closer to what I had in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $107?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  $107 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about $111?  That's closer to your last offer and hopefully something we can both agree on.",111.0,Alice,5,
