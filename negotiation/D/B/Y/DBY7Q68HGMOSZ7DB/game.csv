"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to be flexible and make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.
