The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. I can do better than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $8,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for her, as she values it at $8,000.  I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

Alice is not budging much. I'm going to try one more counteroffer. I'm running out of time."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

I'm going to offer Alice $9,250. This is a fair compromise and hopefully she'll accept. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still determined to get the product for the best possible price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting too high. I've made several counteroffers, but she's not willing to budge much. I don't want to risk running out of time and ending up with a deal that's not favorable to me.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $15,000.  It's not the best deal, but it's better than risking further negotiation with Alice."
