"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a very good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $775,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is a very good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,5,
