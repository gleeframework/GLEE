Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're leaving some space for Bob to counteroffer without you having to immediately sell to John.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's incentive for him to negotiate."
