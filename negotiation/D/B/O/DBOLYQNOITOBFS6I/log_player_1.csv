Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob might get from the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly allows for Bob to counter, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $12,000, I'm hoping to:

* Gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects outright, it might indicate he's unwilling to pay much more than $8,000 and I can move on to John.
* Create a starting point for negotiation. If he counters, I can assess his willingness to pay and adjust my offers accordingly. 
*  Potentially secure a price closer to my minimum value if he's enthusiastic about the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my starting offer of $12,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** There's room for negotiation.  Bob's offer indicates he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $8,000.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. I can use this to push Bob to increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I believe the product is worth more. I'm  using John's offer as a reference point to encourage Bob to come closer to my target price.  The next round will allow me to explore if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering your interest and the value you'll get from this product. It's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product, hoping to further incentivize him to meet me in the middle. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes a win-win outcome. 

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering at $10,500:

* **Test the Waters:** I can gauge Bob's true willingness to pay.  If he accepts, I've secured a decent price. 
* **Position for a Possible Final Round:** If he rejects, I can use the $15,000 offer from John as leverage in the final round to push for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $10000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is only $500 away from my counteroffer of $10,500. This is a small enough difference that further negotiation might not be worth the effort.
* **Time Factor:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, the back and forth could be time-consuming. This is especially true if I'm considering John's offer as a fallback.
* **Good Compromise:** $10,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer of $9,000 and well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a good price while minimizing further negotiation time.  I'm  also avoiding the risk of Bob walking away entirely, which could force me to accept John's offer. This outcome offers a good balance of profit and efficiency."
