"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $95 for this product.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105. I can do $108, and that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",108.0,Alice,5,,
