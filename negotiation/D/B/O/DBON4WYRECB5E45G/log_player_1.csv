Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I can still negotiate further or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is still too low for me. I will try to get closer to my desired price with a counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects, I'm still better off selling to John for $120, but I'm hoping to get a deal that's closer to my minimum acceptable price."
