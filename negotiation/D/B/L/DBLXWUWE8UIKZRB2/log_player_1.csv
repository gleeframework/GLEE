"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum value. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but still expect a fair price for the product.  I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
