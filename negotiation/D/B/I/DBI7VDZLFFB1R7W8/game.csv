"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's try to find a common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, but $1,000,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
