"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $8,000, so it's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, you still save $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **It's a win-win:** Alice gets a better price than selling to John, and you get the product for less than your maximum budget."
