"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is a great price, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  While Alice's offer is above your ideal price point, it's still cheaper than buying from John.
* **You can likely negotiate with Alice:** Since Alice is motivated to sell and you're willing to buy, there's room for negotiation. You can try to counteroffer with a lower price, aiming to get closer to your $12,000 limit."
