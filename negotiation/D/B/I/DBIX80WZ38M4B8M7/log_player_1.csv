Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a safety net.  The sweet spot is finding a price that's significantly more than your minimum but still appealing to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're positioning the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while still saving Bob $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if it's time to walk away and sell to John."
