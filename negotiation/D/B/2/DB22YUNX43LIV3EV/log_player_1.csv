{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counter. It also keeps me closer to my minimum value, while leaving some wiggle room.  I'll need to watch how Bob responds to know if I should counter or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $9,500, it's significantly less than my minimum of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, which would be $10,000. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still not ideal. John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll take his offer and sell to him.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
