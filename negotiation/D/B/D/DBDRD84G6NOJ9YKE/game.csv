"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $6,500, which would be $7,750. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",7750.0,Alice,5,
