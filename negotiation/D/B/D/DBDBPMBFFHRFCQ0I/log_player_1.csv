Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  Alice has a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed offer meeting her minimum price, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without going below $1,500,000.  There's no incentive to offer a price lower than John's offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Starting High:** This offer significantly exceeds both Bob's valuation and Alice's minimum.  It provides room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the ""unique value"" and ""true worth"", Alice creates a narrative that might justify the high price, even if Bob is aware of its lower objective value to him.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. Alice can then strategically negotiate down towards her minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** Bob might outright reject this high offer. However, Alice is secure knowing she has John's offer as a backup."
