"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. He has a significant buffer between his maximum value and Alice's offer, allowing for room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit and is a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product. How about $1,300,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and is closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  He can save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or him needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation."
