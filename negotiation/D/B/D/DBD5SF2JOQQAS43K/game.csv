"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still significantly higher than my minimum. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a substantial profit and is a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product. How about $1,300,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and is closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
