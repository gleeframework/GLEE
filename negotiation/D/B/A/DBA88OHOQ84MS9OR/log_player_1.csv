Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling it for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Bob's offer is only $75. While I want to close the deal, it's not worth selling below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $85, which is still a great deal for such a fantastic product.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $80 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
