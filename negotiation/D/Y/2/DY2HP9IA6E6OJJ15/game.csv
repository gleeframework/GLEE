"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $15,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm only willing to go up to $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can work this out.",9000.0,Bob,4,
