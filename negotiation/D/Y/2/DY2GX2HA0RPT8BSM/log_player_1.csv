"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also setting the stage for negotiation, as Bob is likely to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob, hoping he'll accept this compromise. If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to consider his next counteroffer and potentially sell to John if it gets too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my ideal price, and I'm already four rounds in. It's getting risky to keep pushing, and I might end up losing more than just a few dollars.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good profit and avoid the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John."
