Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $135 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
* **Focusing on value, not just price:** Highlighting the ""value it provides"" aims to justify the price and make it more appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might choose a different approach."
