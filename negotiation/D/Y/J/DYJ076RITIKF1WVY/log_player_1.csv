"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $85. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to try and get a better price, as he's indicated he's interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I think that's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still can't afford to pay $87.50. I would like to stick to my original offer of $85 if possible. Thank you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I've already had 4 rounds of negotiation and it doesn't seem like we'll agree on a price that meets my minimum. I'm running out of rounds, so I'm going to accept the guaranteed sale to John for $80 to avoid the risk of no sale at all."
