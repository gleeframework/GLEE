"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is above your limit, we'll reject and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground here.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is within your budget.  It's a good deal considering you can get it for $1,000,000 from John."
