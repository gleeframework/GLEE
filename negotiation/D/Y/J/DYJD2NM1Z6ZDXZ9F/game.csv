"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground here. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
