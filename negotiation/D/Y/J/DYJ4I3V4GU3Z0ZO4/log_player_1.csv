Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose him.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $200,000 surplus as possible while still ensuring Bob finds the deal agreeable.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is significant enough to be appealing.
* **No Justification:** Avoid explicitly stating why you've chosen this price. This prevents you from anchoring the negotiation too low.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering a price Bob might consider a good deal."
