"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $85, that's closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get as much as you can, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'll offer you $90.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
