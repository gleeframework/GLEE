Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not going too high:** I'm not setting the price unrealistically high, as that could immediately make Bob walk away.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below it. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding settling for less:** Selling to John for $100 is a good backup option, but I want to maximize my profits if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $85, that's closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm decreasing my price to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not by too much.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Maintaining a fair position:** $95 is still a reasonable price for Bob, as he values the product at $80. This keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get as much as you can, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'll offer you $90.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $90 is very close to my minimum of $100.  
* **Risk of losing Bob:** Bob is threatening to go with John's offer, which means I'd only get $100.
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting Bob's offer might lead to future business opportunities with him.

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision in this situation.  It secures a sale for me, prevents me from losing out completely, and could open the door for future interactions with Bob."
