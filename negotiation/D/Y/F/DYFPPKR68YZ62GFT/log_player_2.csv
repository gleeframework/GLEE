Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $1,200,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover a reasonable amount. Let me know what you think.
