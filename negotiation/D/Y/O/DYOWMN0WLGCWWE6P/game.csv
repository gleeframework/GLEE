"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,650,000. This price still allows me some profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000 for the product.
