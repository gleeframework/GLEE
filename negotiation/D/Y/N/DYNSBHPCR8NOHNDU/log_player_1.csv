"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I have several rounds left and I believe I can get a better deal. I am also willing to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations don't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $13,200 isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $13,400. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 6, and while Bob's offer of $13,300 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Given that we only have 4 rounds left, and the negotiations haven't moved significantly, it's better for me to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $15,000.  This guarantees me a profit and avoids further haggling with Bob."
