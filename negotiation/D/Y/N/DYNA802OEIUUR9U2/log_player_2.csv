"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is close to my maximum budget, and I want to try and get a better price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room to negotiate, as Alice's offer is significantly higher than her minimum value of $800,000. 
* **Time to counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to spend a few rounds trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, based on my own valuation and the market. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant way off from where I see the value.  This product has the potential to be a real game-changer for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $1,025,000 is still above my desired price range.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her offer shows she's starting to come down. 
* **Time to push further:** I have time to continue negotiating and see if I can get Alice to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $987,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 987500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $987,500 is close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is within my budget and represents a significant compromise from her previous offers.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I keep rejecting offers, I risk Alice becoming less flexible and eventually walking away, or I might run out of rounds. 
* **Time is a factor:** I'm halfway through my negotiation rounds, and buying from John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.

**At $1,000,000, I'm saving $200,000 compared to John's price, which is a substantial gain.**  While I might be able to get a slightly lower price with more rounds, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a few more thousand dollars in savings."
