"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below the product's value to him, but still above my minimum price. I'll see if he's willing to pay that amount before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and we can finalize the deal."
