"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

There's no point in negotiating with Alice. You've already established that John is willing to sell the product for your maximum price of $1,500,000. Engaging in negotiations with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting your counteroffers, potentially leading to a higher final price or even losing the opportunity to buy the product. 

It's always better to secure a deal at your desired price than risk overpaying or losing out entirely."
