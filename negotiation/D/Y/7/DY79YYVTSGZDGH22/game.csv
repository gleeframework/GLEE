"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal interests. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you may be even higher. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1800000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1600000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1700000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
