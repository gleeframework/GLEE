"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $175. This still leaves me a decent profit margin while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",150.0,Bob,4,
