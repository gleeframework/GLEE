"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you. While I agree this product would be beneficial, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we settle at $925,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being manageable for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
