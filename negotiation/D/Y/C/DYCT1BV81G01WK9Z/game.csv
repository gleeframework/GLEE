"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,500? This is the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $15,500? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my asking price and still within your budget. Let me know if you're willing to go for it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
