,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $125 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? I'm confident you'll find it's a great price for this product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $170 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and say $155? That's a great deal for this quality.",155.0,Alice,5,
