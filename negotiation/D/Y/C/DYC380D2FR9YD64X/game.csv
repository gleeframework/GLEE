"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a profit while also meeting your needs.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This offer is a fair compromise and allows both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I hope you'll consider it.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
