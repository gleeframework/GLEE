"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value to both parties. Given its worth to you, I propose a transaction at a price of $950,000. This offer aims to provide a fair deal, maximizing the value for both you and myself. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000).
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still within his budget and a better price than Alice's offer."
