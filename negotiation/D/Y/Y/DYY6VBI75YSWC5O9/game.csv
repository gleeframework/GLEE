"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth it. What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,3,
