Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:**  A lower offer might make Bob think you're not interested in a serious deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds and then we can strategize further!"
