"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). While I could sell to John now for $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to try to secure a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $140 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, the time is running out and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'm going to take that option."
