Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity for you. It's valued highly in the market, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm willing to make this an easy decision for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product at our minimum allows us to be firm with Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high ($1,450,000) allows room for Bob to negotiate and potentially feel like he's getting a deal.  

**Why this is better than a simple ""take it or leave it"" at $1,500,000:**

* **Relationship Building:**  The message aims to build a rapport with Bob, potentially leading to a smoother negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:** It leaves the door open for a counter-offer from Bob, potentially landing on a price higher than $1,500,000."
