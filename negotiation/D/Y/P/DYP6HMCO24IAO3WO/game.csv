"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? I think that's a fair price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
