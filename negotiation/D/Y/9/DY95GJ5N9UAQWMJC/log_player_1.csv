Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible.  

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that John is a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you consider selling it to me for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than Bob's initial $10,000, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you get."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'll consider your offer of $11,500. However, I still aim to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $11,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much, and I'm getting closer to my minimum value with each round. At this point, it's likely that he'll keep counteroffering at $11,000, which is still too low for me.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, it's time to cut my losses and move on."
