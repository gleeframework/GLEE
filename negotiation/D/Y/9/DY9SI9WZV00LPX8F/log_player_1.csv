"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a strong opening offer, leaving a significant margin for negotiation while still being considerably higher than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm confident we can reach a more favorable agreement through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer compromises slightly from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway while still aiming for a profitable sale.  The difference of $50,000 from Bob's last offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's also a significant enough increase to potentially incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough for me to accept. I believe there is still room for further negotiation and I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale. This offer also bridges the gap between our current positions, making it more likely for Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can close a deal that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a profitable sale for me and only $50,000 higher than Bob's offer. With only 3 rounds left, it's time to start considering the possibility of accepting a lower price to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet. There are still two rounds left and I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer to see if we can close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

With only one round left, I need to make a decision. I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This offer reflects the urgency of closing a deal before selling to John and the risk of ending up with nothing if I reject Bob's final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer is still pretty close to my minimum, I don't have time for further negotiation. There's a real risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, leaving me with no deal at all. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit, which is the most important thing in this situation."
