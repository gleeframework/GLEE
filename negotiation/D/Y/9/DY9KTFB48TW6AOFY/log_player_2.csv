"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $750000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than the price you would pay John ($1,000,000).  While you don't know Alice's value for the product, accepting her offer saves you $250,000.  It's always better to get a lower price, even if you don't know the exact value of the product."
