"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is my maximum budget, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob has a good alternative with John, so he's in a strong position to try for a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and he can aim to get closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but my budget is firm at $850,000. If you're willing to accept this offer, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925000. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but she's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has a concrete alternative with John and can afford to keep pushing for a better deal. He has a few more rounds left, so it's worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal for $875,000. This price is fair and represents a significant discount from your original asking price.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900000. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still unwilling to go below $900,000, which is outside of Bob's budget.  He has three rounds left, but at this point, it seems unlikely that Alice will budge any further.  Rather than risk losing more time and potentially reaching a stalemate, Bob decides to purchase the product from John for $800,000, which is a safe and secure option within his budget."
