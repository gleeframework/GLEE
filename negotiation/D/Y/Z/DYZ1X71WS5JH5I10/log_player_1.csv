{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could net you a quicker sale and slightly more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,999 is just below your minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value.  This makes it more likely Bob will perceive it as a good deal.
* **Psychology:**  The ""99"" at the end of the price creates a psychological effect, making it seem more appealing than a round $12,000.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of exceeding your guaranteed sale price."
