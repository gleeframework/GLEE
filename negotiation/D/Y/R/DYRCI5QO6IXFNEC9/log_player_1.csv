"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point, considering my minimum value is $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 9 rounds left to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum, and I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not desperate to sell just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125.  It's only $5 more than Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping he sees that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I have 5 rounds left, so I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is significantly below my minimum price. While I have rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm also concerned that Bob might continue to lower his offers. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
