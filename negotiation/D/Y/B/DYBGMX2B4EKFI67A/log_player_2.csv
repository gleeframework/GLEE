Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. How about we try $850,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $750,000, which is still a good profit for me. However, I need to emphasize that I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think, Bob?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $725,000. I'm going to make a final offer of $775,000. This is my last chance to get a decent price for the product, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $775,000 is tempting, it's still more expensive than John's guaranteed price of $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice when you have a better option available."
