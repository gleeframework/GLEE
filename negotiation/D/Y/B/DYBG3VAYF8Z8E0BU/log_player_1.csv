Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also shows you're serious about making a deal.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further but will not accept an offer below $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  I'm confident you'll still make a profit, and it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my acceptable threshold. I'm not willing to risk going back and forth further.  I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
