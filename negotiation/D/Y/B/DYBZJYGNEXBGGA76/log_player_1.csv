{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Starting high but not too high is a good tactic. It gives Bob a sense of value and room to negotiate, but it also ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product. I also keep the option to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I want to get the best possible price, I'm not desperate and can sell to John for a better price.

**Reasoning:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially secure a better price in the next round. I also have the safety net of selling to John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still represents a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering with a price of $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* The message is friendly and reiterates the benefit for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

By lowering my price, I show a willingness to compromise. I'm still above Bob's offer, but I'm leaving some room for further negotiation.  I also keep the option of selling to John if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I want to maximize my profit, and I believe I can still do better.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a solid backup option in John. This gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price. 
* By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum.
* I'm hoping that another counteroffer from Bob will push the price closer to $11,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand your concerns about the price. However,  $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. To show good faith, I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This price is fair for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm counteroffering with a price of $11,250. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* The message emphasizes fairness and the potential benefit for both parties. It acknowledges Bob's concerns but also reminds him of the value of the product.

**Reasoning:**

By slightly lowering my price and emphasizing fairness, I'm trying to bridge the gap with Bob.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that allows me to potentially close the deal while also ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for a higher price, so there's no pressure to accept a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10800. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum price of $15,000, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm getting the sense that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to choose to sell to him and avoid further haggling.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum target and significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort.  There's no guarantee that he'll ever accept a price that I'm comfortable with.
* **Limited Upside:**  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but the gap is still significant. It's unlikely that I'll be able to extract a much higher price from him, even with further rounds of negotiation. 

Selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision in this situation."
