Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Mentioning that I'm open to negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer.

**Strategy:** This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open. By starting high and showing willingness to negotiate, I can potentially secure a higher price while also giving Bob a chance to engage in a back-and-forth dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum ($80), I'm not satisfied with it yet. I want to try and squeeze out a bit more. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial $100, potentially finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $75 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm sure you'll agree this is still a great deal for such a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Argument:** I address Bob's offer directly, acknowledging his counterproposal while stating it's still too low.
* **Compromise:** I propose a compromise by splitting the difference between our last offers. This shows good faith and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reinforce Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to make $85 seem more reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the conversation friendly and encourage further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more,  it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and clean transaction, and I'm happy to walk away with my minimum."
