"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",9200.0,Alice,5,
