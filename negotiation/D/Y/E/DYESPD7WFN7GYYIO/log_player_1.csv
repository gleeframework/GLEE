"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I believe I can get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a bit more than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum and the negotiation is getting longer.  I'm not sure I can get a higher price and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
