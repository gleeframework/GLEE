Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000.  This is a unique product with several advantages and I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. "",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value as possible without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Highlighting the product's value and my existing offer from John subtly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act fast."
