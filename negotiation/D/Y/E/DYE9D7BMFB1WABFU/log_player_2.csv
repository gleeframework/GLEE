Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving from your initial position, but the current gap between us is too large to bridge in one step. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as I believe it represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
