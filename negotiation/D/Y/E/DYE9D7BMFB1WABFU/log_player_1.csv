"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level.  His response will reveal how motivated he is to buy the product. 
* **John as a Backup:** The presence of John, willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, gives you a strong alternative and leverage in the negotiation. You don't need to settle for less than what you know you can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is my best offer, and it's the maximum I'm comfortable paying. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  You have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a safety net if the deal with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my valuation for this product is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** While still aiming high, the substantial decrease from $2,200,000 to $1,950,000 shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's value and your bottom line.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to engage in more realistic price discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. While I value the product, my budget for this purchase remains at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial offer, indicating he might not be willing to budge much. However, it's still early in the negotiation, and walking away now for John's offer would leave potential profit on the table. It's time to signal you're willing to negotiate but won't accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is substantial. I'm open to finding a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Let's try $1,600,000. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the product's significant worth."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Closer to the Middle:** This counteroffer makes a considerable jump down from $1,950,000 to $1,600,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The price remains well above your $1,500,000 minimum and Bob's $800,000 offer, aiming for a price point where both parties might find common ground.
* **Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining,  emphasizing the need for Bob to move closer to your price range becomes more critical."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profitable sale while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has slightly increased his offer, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price. It's clear he's trying to see how low you'll go.  You need to show firmness while still indicating a willingness to negotiate a reasonable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving from your initial position, but the current gap between us is too large to bridge in one step. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as I believe it represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer strategically drops closer to your minimum price, showing a willingness to negotiate but without giving away too much ground at once.
* **Time Constraint Emphasis:** By bringing the price closer to your acceptable range, you subtly increase the pressure on Bob to make a more significant move. 
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This offer will reveal if Bob is truly willing to negotiate beyond small increments or if he's firmly anchored at the low end. This information is crucial as you approach the later rounds."
