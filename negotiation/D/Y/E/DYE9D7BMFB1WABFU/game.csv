"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is my best offer, and it's the maximum I'm comfortable paying. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my valuation for this product is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me. While I value the product, my budget for this purchase remains at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is substantial. I'm open to finding a compromise, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Let's try $1,600,000. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the product's significant worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving from your initial position, but the current gap between us is too large to bridge in one step. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as I believe it represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for a product of this caliber.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
