"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a significant step for me.  I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
