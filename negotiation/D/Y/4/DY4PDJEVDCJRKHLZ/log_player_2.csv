"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you than that.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds, and you can counteroffer.  There's a good chance you can get the price lower.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You know you can always buy from John for $15,000, so you don't need to accept a bad deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $2,000 drop from Alice's price is a solid starting point, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,000 is still within your budget, and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and open helps keep the negotiation flowing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While she came down from $12,000, $11,000 is still $1,000 more than your initial counteroffer. 
* **More room for negotiation:** You have 7 rounds remaining. You can likely get the price down closer to your target.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** It's better to risk a few more rounds of negotiation than to settle for a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $10,500. This feels like a fair compromise, and it's closer to where I'm comfortable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($10,000) and Alice's offer ($11,000), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying within your budget:** $10,500 is still within your maximum spending limit.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message continues to be friendly and emphasizes the desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this deal, which would still be a great value for you. Let's close this now, as I'm getting other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn:**  She's refusing to budge from $11,000, even after your counteroffer showed a willingness to compromise.
* **Plenty of time left:**  You have 5 rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price.
* **John is a safety net:** You can still buy from John for $15,000, giving you room to keep negotiating with Alice.  You don't need to accept a deal that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm feeling a bit pressured by your other offers, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Raising the Stakes:**  You're increasing your offer slightly, showing that you're serious about getting a deal.
* **Finality:**  Stating it's your final offer creates urgency, potentially making Alice more willing to compromise.
* **John's Influence:**  Mentioning considering other options subtly reminds Alice that you have alternatives if the deal falls through.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $10,750 is still a significant amount of money for you but leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're feeling the pressure, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's only $150 above your last offer. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Gap:** Alice's offer is only $150 more than your last counteroffer.
* **Limited Time:** You have only 3 rounds left.
* **Value for You:** Even though $10,900 is a little more than you wanted, it's still a decent deal for you considering your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Risk of John:** If you reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate, you risk ending up with John's offer, which is significantly higher.

At this point, it's better to take the deal and save the potential for further negotiation with John."
