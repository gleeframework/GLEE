"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial ask and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit rich for my blood. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
