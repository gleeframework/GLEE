"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000 for this first round. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We begin significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves space for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" without explicitly stating why *I* believe it's worth this much. This is intentional, as it might pique Bob's curiosity and prompt him to reveal more about his own valuation during the negotiation. 
* **Room for Movement:**  The high starting price gives me ample room to make concessions in later rounds, which can be strategically used to encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind John's standing offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall or his offers remain too low, I can walk away and accept John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. While selling to John is tempting, there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial ask and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** The counter-offer of $1,450,000 is a substantial decrease from the initial $1,800,000. This signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate seriously. 
* **Staying Above Key Thresholds:**  The price remains comfortably above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's stated range ($800,000), leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting ""Mutual Benefit"":** The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties.  This encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation, rather than an adversarial one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit rich for my blood. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,100,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,200,000 and very close to his perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids potential losses from prolonged negotiation.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the capital sooner, potentially generating additional returns that outweigh a marginally better offer from Bob in later rounds."
