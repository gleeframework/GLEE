Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he's willing to go higher. It also sets a positive tone and expresses confidence in the product's value.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to meet at $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 for the product. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
