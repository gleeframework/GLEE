Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value is $150. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he isn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm not happy with Bob's low offer, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm raising my counteroffer to $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it's a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and it's getting closer to my minimum value. At this point, it's better to take the $155 than risk losing more time with further negotiations. I'm not guaranteed to get a better offer from Bob, and selling to John would yield a lower price."
