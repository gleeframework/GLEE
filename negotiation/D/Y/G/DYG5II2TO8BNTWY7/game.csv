,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $875,000 is closer to my desired range, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This would allow both of us to gain something from this deal. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
