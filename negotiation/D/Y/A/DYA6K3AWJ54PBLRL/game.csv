"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $9,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm able to pay. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
