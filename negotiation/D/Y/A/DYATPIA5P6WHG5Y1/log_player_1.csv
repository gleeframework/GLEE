Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a great deal, as I know you value it at $8,000.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to maximize profit.** This means getting as close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's value is $8,000.**  This means I can't go above that price, or he'll definitely reject the offer.
* **John's value is $15,000.** This is my safety net â€“ if Bob rejects, I still get a good price.
* **The offer is a compromise.** $12,000 is a good midpoint between my minimum and Bob's maximum. It gives Bob a good deal, but also allows me to make a decent profit. 

This strategy increases my chances of selling to Bob (who is willing to pay more than John) while still ensuring I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
