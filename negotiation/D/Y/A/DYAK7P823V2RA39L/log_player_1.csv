Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""quality and features,"" I'm attempting to subtly shift his focus from the price to the potential value the product offers. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts my initial high price.
2. **Gather Information:**  His reaction (acceptance, counteroffer, or rejection) will give me insight into how much he values the product and how aggressively I can negotiate. 
 
Remember: I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm negotiating from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm choosing to reject and counter-offer because:

* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a $30 gap between his offer and my walk-away price. I believe I can bridge at least part of that difference.
* **Signal Flexibility:** By rejecting but counter-offering, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any price.

I'll aim for a counter-offer that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I've made a significant move from my initial price, signaling flexibility. However, I am still above both my minimum and halfway between our last offers.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Observation:**  Bob's firm upper limit at $120 suggests he might value the product more than he initially let on. This round will be telling in terms of how much further I can push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a bit more in another round, there's no guarantee he would go higher. Accepting his offer secures me the best possible outcome in this negotiation."
