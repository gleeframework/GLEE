"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $90. It's a great deal and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can get the product for $10 less from John. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer and going with John's deal makes the most sense."
