**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly committed to meeting somewhere in the middle. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and we risk her pulling back towards $8,250 or higher. Accepting at $8,150 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to pay John's $10,000 price."
