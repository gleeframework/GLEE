"Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
