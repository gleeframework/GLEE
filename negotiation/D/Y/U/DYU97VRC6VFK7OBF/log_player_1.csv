"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
