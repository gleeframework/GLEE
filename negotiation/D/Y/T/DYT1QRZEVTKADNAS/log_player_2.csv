"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $150? I'm open to negotiation and would like to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 80}

I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your response.
