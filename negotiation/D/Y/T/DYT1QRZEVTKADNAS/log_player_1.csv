Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $150? I'm open to negotiation and would like to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in our product.

I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your response."", ""product_price"": 100}"
