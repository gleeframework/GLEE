"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $150? I'm open to negotiation and would like to find a price that works for both of us.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in our product. I'd like to counter your offer with a suggestion of $100 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer, but still within a reasonable range considering its value. I hope this proposal works for you, and I look forward to your response.",100.0,Alice,3,
