"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go below $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",925000.0,Alice,5,
