"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $10,500? That gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would give you a fantastic price and allow me to close this deal. Let's see if we can make this work!",10000.0,Alice,5,
