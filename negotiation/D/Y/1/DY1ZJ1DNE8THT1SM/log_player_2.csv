"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, saving $100,000 is a significant benefit."
