Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer slightly above his perceived value gives room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Profit:** Offering it at $130 ensures a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The ""special price"" wording might encourage Bob to act quickly, fearing he might miss out. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell it to John for her minimum desired price."
