# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. It offers significant potential, and $900,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price, but it's getting closer. It's wise to reject and continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This price reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, I'm still hesitant to accept. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further. I can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential of this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
