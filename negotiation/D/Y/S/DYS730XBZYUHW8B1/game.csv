"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000. This price reflects the value you've identified in the product while still allowing me a fair return.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer is still well above what I could get elsewhere, and it's closer to your last offer. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close. Let's be realistic - I'm not going to go much lower than this.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and it lets us avoid the risk of this deal falling through.  Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
