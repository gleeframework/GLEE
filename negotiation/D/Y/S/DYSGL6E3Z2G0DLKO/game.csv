"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. This is a significant opportunity for both of us to gain a valuable asset.  Consider this my best offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my minimum asking price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
