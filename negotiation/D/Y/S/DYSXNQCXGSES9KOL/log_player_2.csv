"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also less than John's offer of $150. This is a good deal for you!"
