"Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be responsible with your budget, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go slightly higher than $16,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
