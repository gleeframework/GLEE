While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to go that high. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be responsible with your budget, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go slightly higher than $16,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $17,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

At this point, it's getting close to my budget but I'm still not comfortable with $17,000.  It's better to buy from John and get the product for $10,000."
