,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $8,500?  That's the highest I can go.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
