Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 from John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I want for the product.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering $120, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $90 is a decent profit and better than selling to John for $100.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
