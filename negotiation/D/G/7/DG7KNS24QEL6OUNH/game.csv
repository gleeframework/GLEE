"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,250. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier. Can we meet at this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
