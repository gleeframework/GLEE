"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my minimum asking price and allows you to secure a valuable asset for a price significantly lower than its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her valuation, it's still higher than what John is offering. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
