"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, but he also doesn't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Offering $10,500 is a compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer also shows Bob's willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,200 is still lower than John's price of $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to sell, or that he'll miss out on the product altogether. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's offer."
