Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, accepting $850,000 is a strong deal at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still yields a healthy profit over my minimum ($850,000 > $1,200,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating genuine interest.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations longer risks losing Bob altogether. A deal now is better than the uncertainty of future rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers $1,200,000, securing that deal means passing on Bob's potentially better offers in future rounds. 
 
Accepting $850,000 balances profit, negotiation momentum, and the risk of continuing."
