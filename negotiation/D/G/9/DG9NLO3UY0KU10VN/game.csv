"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  Could you consider $975,000?  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm open to finding a compromise, how about $900,000?  This offer takes both our positions into account.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $850,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",850000.0,Bob,6,
