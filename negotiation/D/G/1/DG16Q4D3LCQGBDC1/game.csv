"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $725,000? That would make a big difference for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Alice,5,
