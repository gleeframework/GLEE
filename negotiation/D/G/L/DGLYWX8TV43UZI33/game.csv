"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $825000. I'm going to have to be firm on my price, and I'm thinking of $900000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
