Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $9,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $8,000 offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still higher than John's offer, but I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal."
