"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible while still remaining within his budget. Offering $7,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that the price may not drop to a point that's acceptable to Bob.  Given that John is offering the product for exactly Bob's budget, it's the most prudent decision to buy from John and avoid further potential negotiation complications."
