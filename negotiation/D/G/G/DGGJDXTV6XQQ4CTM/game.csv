"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm still confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, but $15,000 is still above my limit. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $13,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $14,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
