"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $17,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm highlighting the potential value the product holds for Bob. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to go down if necessary.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds.  If we can't agree, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counter-offer is an improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I want to explore options before selling to John for the minimum price.

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer.  This will show flexibility while also aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'll need to be careful not to alienate Bob with an offer he perceives as unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm still confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I'm framing it as a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Clear and concise:** My message is brief and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary jargon or rambling.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make a further concession or sell to John.  The key is to keep a balanced approach: being firm on my minimum price while also showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the value of the product, but $15,000 is still above my limit. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $13,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below the $15,000 I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I've already lowered my price once, but there's still room to negotiate a bit higher. I want to see if I can close the gap without selling to John.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price between Bob's offer and my previous offer. I'll aim for a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway, but still keeps the price above my minimum. This might be the last chance to get a better deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $14,250?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $13,500. It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage a deal.

**Strategy:** 

I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm nearing my limit on rounds and don't want to risk getting a worse deal.  I'll be watching closely for signs of a potential deal or signs that Bob is digging in his heels."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $14,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Time pressure:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum. While it's not ideal, it's a better outcome than selling to John or risking a stalemate and no deal at all."
