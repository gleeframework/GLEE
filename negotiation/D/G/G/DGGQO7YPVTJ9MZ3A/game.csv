"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects its true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $11,500.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000.
