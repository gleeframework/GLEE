Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000.** This is my floor, as I can always sell to John for that amount.
* **Bob's maximum price is $10,000.** This means any price higher than that will lead to Bob rejecting the offer.
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  Offering $14,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly less than my floor price but still allows me to earn more than what Bob is willing to pay. 

This strategy gives me a good chance of getting a sale from Bob while still ensuring I make a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can fall back on selling to John for my desired price."
