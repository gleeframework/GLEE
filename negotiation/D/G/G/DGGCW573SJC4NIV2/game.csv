"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $115.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",110.0,Bob,4,
