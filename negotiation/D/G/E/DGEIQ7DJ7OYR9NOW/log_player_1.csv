Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's high enough to leave room for negotiation, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for a potentially mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring I receive a decent profit.  I'm also prepared to counter Bob's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement with Bob, while also ensuring I make a profit."
