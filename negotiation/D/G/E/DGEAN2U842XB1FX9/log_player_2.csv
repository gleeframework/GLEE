Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?
