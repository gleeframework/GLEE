Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price. I'll try to get closer to $1,300,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,275,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,225,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm confident we can get to a price that is more mutually beneficial. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible, but $1,225,000 isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to both move forward with this transaction. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to make one more push to get this deal done. Would you be willing to meet me at $1200000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $1,200,000, which is too low for me. I'm willing to accept a price of $1,300,000, but he's not willing to go higher. I've already made a few concessions, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000, as this is a better price than what Bob is offering."
