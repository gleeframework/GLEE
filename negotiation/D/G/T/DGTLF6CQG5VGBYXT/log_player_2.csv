"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled to own it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly lower than John's offer.  Even though Alice is being a bit manipulative by inflating the product's worth to you, it's in your best interest to accept her offer and save $300,000."
