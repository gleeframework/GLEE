"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
