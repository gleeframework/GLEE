"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's try to close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
