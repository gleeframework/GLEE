"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $90 is still significantly better than my minimum value and leaves little room for further negotiation. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
