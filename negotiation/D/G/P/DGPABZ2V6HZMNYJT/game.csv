"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $750000.",750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $700000, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $675000. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to your last offer and closer to my budget.  I believe we're close to a deal, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in the next round.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product for $675000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.
