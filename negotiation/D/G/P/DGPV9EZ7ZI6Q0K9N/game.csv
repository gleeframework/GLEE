"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point, but I think it's a fair compromise given the value the product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to come up to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I need to be confident that we're at a price that works for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
