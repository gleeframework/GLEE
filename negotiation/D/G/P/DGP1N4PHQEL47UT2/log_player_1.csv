Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $10,000, implying a public listing hints at potential wider interest and possibly a higher price later.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a safety net. If Bob declines, she can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged."
