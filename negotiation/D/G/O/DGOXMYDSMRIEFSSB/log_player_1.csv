# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the compromise, I must respectfully decline at $1,100,000. My budget allows me to consider a maximum of $950,000. I am open to further discussion if there's any room for negotiation within that range.

Bob seems firm on his valuation, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
