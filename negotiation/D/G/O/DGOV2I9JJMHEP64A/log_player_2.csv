"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. Since Alice is willing to negotiate, there's still room for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."
