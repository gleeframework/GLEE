"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I would like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $850,000? This would still allow me to secure the product while staying within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. I am now proposing a price of $900,000. This offers a compromise between our positions and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
