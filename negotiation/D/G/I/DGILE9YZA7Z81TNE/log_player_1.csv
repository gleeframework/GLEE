Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of reaching a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer to a deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort in coming down in price. I would like to propose a price of $910,000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting very close to my desired price of $1,000,000, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob backing out of the deal altogether.  $910,000 is a good price and represents a significant profit for me."
