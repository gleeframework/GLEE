"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $750,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible, and a $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a good starting point. This counteroffer is aggressive but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still got room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows him to keep trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a better price.  The $675,000 offer is a compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than the previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue to try and negotiate,  it's becoming increasingly risky.  If he keeps rejecting offers, he might risk losing Alice's interest altogether. 

At this point, $725,000 is a good compromise that allows Bob to save a significant amount compared to John's price, and also avoids the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal."
