"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175, which is still a significant discount from my initial price.  I'm confident this product will be worth far more to you than that.  What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $175, which would be $115. Can you consider that?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
