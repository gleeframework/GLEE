"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its value in the current market."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer slightly higher than your target price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe in the product's high value. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a brief reason for the price, even if it's general market conditions, can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offered price is $100,000 below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate while still being significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer goes straight to our minimum acceptable price. While we could accept and end the negotiation now, there's a good chance we can secure a better deal. We have plenty of rounds left, and Bob clearly sees value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but  $1,200,000 is  a significant undervaluation of this product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair:**  We're pushing back on Bob's attempt to lowball us, emphasizing the product's value. However, we're also showing flexibility by lowering our price by a significant amount ($50,000).
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to move the negotiation towards a middle ground. We're still aiming for a price above our minimum while acknowledging Bob's desired price range. 
* **Limited Concessions:** We're making a substantial concession in this round, signaling that we're serious about closing the deal but not willing to give away the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is now very close to our desired price range. Accepting at $1,300,000 gives us a $100,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or stall the negotiation. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the potential need to continue negotiating. This allows us to move on to other opportunities."
