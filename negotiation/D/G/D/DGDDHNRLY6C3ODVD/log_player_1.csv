Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $145 for it. It's in great condition and a steal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product at $145 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but not so high as to be immediately off-putting. It encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested.

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving a good chance of a successful sale."
