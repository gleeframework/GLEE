"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $100. Would you be willing to lower the price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $135, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $135 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. Would you consider $120 for the product?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $120 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  How about $125?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've been considering our negotiations carefully. I believe $120 would be a fair price for both of us. Could you please reconsider and match that price?",120.0,Bob,6,
