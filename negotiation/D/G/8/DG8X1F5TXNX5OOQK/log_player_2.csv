{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay up to $120, but $95 is still a significant cost. 
* **You have room to negotiate:** There's a clear difference between your maximum price and Alice's minimum price, suggesting a potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **No urgency to buy from John:**  You have 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into buying from John yet. 

By rejecting the offer, you can explore a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  Offering $85 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire for a good deal. However, it's still above Alice's minimum price of $80, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Exploring the middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to find the middle ground between your desired price and Alice's price.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** There's still room for both you and Alice to adjust the price further in the remaining rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While lower than her initial offer, $100 is still above your desired price point. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit too high. You can likely push for a lower price, especially with several rounds remaining.
* **No immediate need to buy from John:** There's no urgency to buy from John, as you still have plenty of rounds to negotiate with Alice. 

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to explore a more favorable price with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and progress:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's a reasonable compromise between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While you're increasing your offer, it's still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Time is on your side:** With several rounds left, you have time to see if Alice is willing to meet you in the middle."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $105 is closer to your desired price range, but it's still above what you're willing to pay.
* **More room for negotiation:** Alice has been consistently lowering her price, suggesting she might be willing to come down further. 
* **Time is on your side:**  You have several rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price you're not fully comfortable with.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue to explore a lower price with Alice. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer of $105 and your previous offer of $90. 
* **Building momentum:** By consistently increasing your offer, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While $95 is still above your ideal price, it's a reasonable offer considering Alice's previous price reductions.  If she rejects, you still have several rounds to explore lower prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** Alice's offer has gone back up to $110 after being at $105. This suggests she might be unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with.
* **Time is running out:** With only a few rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is high. There's a chance that you might not be able to reach a deal, and you'll end up with nothing.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Although John's price is your maximum, it guarantees you'll get the product. This is a safe option, especially considering the limited time remaining and Alice's recent price increase.

It's better to secure the product with John at a price you're comfortable with rather than risk a deal with Alice that might fall through."
