Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest,  $800,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's try to find a compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise. This offer is a significant concession on my end, and it reflects the value the product offers.  Let's close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm ready to make a final concession, and I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,075,000.  We've been steadily negotiating, and she's made it clear this is her final concession.  While getting the product from Alice for a slightly lower price would be ideal, we have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
