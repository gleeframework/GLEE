Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still lower than my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The offer is high enough to entice Bob, but not so high that he immediately rejects it. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always prepared to go with John's offer of $1,000,000 if Bob proves to be too difficult to negotiate with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiating room:**  I'm not willing to settle for that price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob because I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup. 
* **Counter-offer potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer of $900,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above Bob's offer:**  It's also still higher than Bob's offer of $750,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Motivating Bob:**  The offer is closer to Bob's perceived value, potentially increasing his likelihood of accepting.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,000,000, so I'm keeping some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $825000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation could result in a higher price, but it also carries the risk of Bob rejecting my offer again or me reaching a stalemate. 
* **Time and effort:**  The negotiation is already taking time and effort. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, the difference between his offer and Bob's is relatively small, and the potential for further negotiation with Bob is worth considering.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point. It secures a good price while minimizing the risk of a failed negotiation or missing out on the opportunity to sell the product to Bob."
