Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to justify the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative (""What do you think?""), suggesting you're open to discussing the price further if Bob pushes back.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider the offer."
