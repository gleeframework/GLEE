"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's first offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Bob has 10 rounds, and John is always an option for $800,000, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is just not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $950000?  This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob has 7 more rounds before having to resort to buying from John.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob more leverage to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925000. This is a reasonable offer that recognizes the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a reasonable offer, but Bob can still potentially save more.  He has 5 rounds left, and John is always an option if he needs to.  Bob should try to push for a price closer to his target of $800,000 by rejecting this offer and countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but $900000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975000. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value.  We're getting closer, and I hope we can reach an agreement in the next round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $975,000, Bob has only 3 rounds left.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants to.  

By buying from John, Bob secures the product at his target price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
