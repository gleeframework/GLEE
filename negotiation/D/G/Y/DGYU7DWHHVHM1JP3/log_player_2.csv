"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $22,000. I think it could really benefit you and I've priced it competitively for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It's highly unlikely you'll reach an agreeable price starting from $22,000.  It's time to make a counteroffer much closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is intentionally low. It sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it gives you significant room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer but firmly states your position that $22,000 is unacceptable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking ""Would you consider...?"", the message leaves room for Alice to counter without shutting down the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $18,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $18,000 is still too far from your $10,000 maximum. Her language (""best offer"" and ""true worth"") suggests she may not be willing to budge much.  You have room to counter, but it's also wise to consider John's offer more seriously now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, I could go as high as $9,500.  This is a fair offer, considering I have other options available."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:**  You're moving closer to your $10,000 limit, but in smaller increments to signal you're reaching your upper boundary.
* **Introducing Alternatives:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice that you're not solely dependent on her deal, putting slight pressure on her to negotiate.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between your previous offer and her current one."
