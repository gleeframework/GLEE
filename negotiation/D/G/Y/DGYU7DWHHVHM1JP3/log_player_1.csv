Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, I could go as high as $9,500.  This is a fair offer, considering I have other options available.
