Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm holding firm at $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $8,500. I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise to make this deal work. Let's settle on $9,000.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
