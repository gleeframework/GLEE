"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. ",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  It's a win-win situation for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
