"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'd be happy to pay $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a good opportunity. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and attempt to push the price lower.  He has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, which gives him some leverage in this negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your position,  $1,350,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet at $1,320,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,320,000, which is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,200,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, it's more advantageous for him to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  It saves him $120,000."
