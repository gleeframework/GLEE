"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price, leaving room for negotiation and maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Value-Based Argument:**  I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, trying to incentivize him to see the deal as beneficial despite the high price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and inviting, signaling a willingness to discuss. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Financial Situation:** I'm assuming Bob has the financial means to potentially pay a higher price, but this is a factor to consider.
* **Negotiation Skills:** I'm confident in my ability to negotiate effectively, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer acts as a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **I have more leverage.**  John is willing to pay my minimum, giving me a solid fallback option. This allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer. 
* **Potential for a better deal.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to find a price that is more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value, even considering your specific needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm not dropping the price too drastically, sending a signal that I'm serious about achieving a fair price.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to both Bob and myself, trying to create a sense of shared understanding.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for further discussion and potential compromise. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Reaction:** I'm watching closely to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.
* **Time Pressure:** With 10 rounds, I need to strike a balance between being firm and finding a solution quickly.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a powerful tool, ensuring that I'm not forced into an unfavorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or move on to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to Round 5 and send Bob a counteroffer. I will try to bridge the gap further, but I won't compromise below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering to split the difference between Bob's last offer and my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to find common ground.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a way to achieve a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm making it clear that this is a serious offer, signaling that I'm ready to close the deal if he accepts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'm carefully observing Bob's reactions to gauge his interest in this offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 6 rounds left, I need to find a solution quickly while still maintaining my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $1,350,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out.**  We are already in Round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left. It's unlikely I can negotiate a higher price with Bob within this timeframe.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price. This is a safer and more efficient option than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who may not budge any further.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Future Negotiations:**  While I'm selling to John now, I might reconsider negotiating with Bob in the future if he reaches out with a more attractive offer. However, for now, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential risk of further negotiations with Bob."
