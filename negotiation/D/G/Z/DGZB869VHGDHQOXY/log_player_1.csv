Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should switch to John's guaranteed $120 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $70 is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum price of $120. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer. If Bob rejects again, I'll reassess my options, keeping in mind that John is still a viable alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum price of $120. While a bit more enticing than his initial offer, it's not worth continuing to negotiate.  I'll sell the product to John for $120 and guarantee myself a profit."
