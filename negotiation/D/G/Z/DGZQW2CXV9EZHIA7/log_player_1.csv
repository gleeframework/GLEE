"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but lower than what it's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** My starting price isn't unreasonable enough to make Bob immediately reject the offer.

This strategy aims to initiate the negotiation in a way that's both favorable and keeps the door open for further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is far off, it's not completely unreasonable. I still have 8 rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him. It signals that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

I will counteroffer in the next round with a price that is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price. This demonstrates good faith and keeps the dialogue open.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to his business. This helps justify my counteroffer.
* **""Split the difference"" approach:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can lead to a quicker agreement.

**Overall:** I'm aiming for a price that's still profitable for me while being closer to what Bob is willing to pay. This increases the chances of closing a deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. 
* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 4 of 10, so I need to start pushing for a better deal. 
* **John as a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a more desirable outcome than selling to Bob at $700,000.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $800,000, attempting to meet Bob halfway while still securing a decent profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the potential of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows good faith and demonstrates that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing potential:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it can benefit his business.
* **Urgency:** The ""let's shake hands"" phrase implies that I'm ready to close the deal and adds a sense of urgency.

By continuing to negotiate and moving closer to Bob's price, I hope to secure a profitable deal before the time limit expires. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my options and might decide to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not at my minimum:** While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $1,000,000.
* **John as a safe alternative:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a more desirable outcome than selling to Bob at $750,000.
* **Limited time:** We are in round 6 out of 10, so time is running out. 

I need to push for a higher price.  I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to make one final concession. How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  It's a win-win situation. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:**  I'm positioning this as my final offer, creating urgency and potentially prompting Bob to accept.
* **Win-win framing:**  I'm highlighting that $800,000 is a good deal for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Value reminder:**  I'm again mentioning the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price that is very close to my minimum acceptable price, hoping that Bob will realize that he might lose the opportunity if he continues to reject my offers.  I'm also leaving a small margin for potential compromise if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $800,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm willing to do business with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, and Bob is not budging on his price. 
* **Minimum not met:**  $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John is a better option:** I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a significantly better deal. 

Given the limited time and the fact that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum, I will sell the product to John to secure the best possible outcome."
