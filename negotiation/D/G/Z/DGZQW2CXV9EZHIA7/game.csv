"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the potential of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to make one final concession. How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  It's a win-win situation. ",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $800,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm willing to do business with you.",750000.0,Bob,8,
