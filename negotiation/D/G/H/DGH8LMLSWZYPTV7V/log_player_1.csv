{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that is above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose $110 as a compromise. I hope this meets closer to your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer that's just slightly lower than my minimum. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to drop my price to $140, which is as low as I can go.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's only $10 more than your last offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
