"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $18000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but I'd like to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $16500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to get a deal done. How about we meet at $17500? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $17500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I think I can do even better than that. Can you consider $16750?",16750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $17000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16900? It's a small step down, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $16900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16500. Can you meet me there?",16500.0,Bob,8,
