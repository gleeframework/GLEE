Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is my opening offer to Bob. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from $15,000 to $14,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob has come up slightly, and we're now within a reasonable range.  Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and a decent profit. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking further negotiations or settling for John's offer."
