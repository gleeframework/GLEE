# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so he doesn't want to pay more.  He should make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway by offering the product at $13,000. This is still a competitive price considering the value it offers. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further.

Bob should buy the product from John. He set his maximum budget at $12,000, and John is offering it at that price. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice as he can get the product at his desired price from John."
