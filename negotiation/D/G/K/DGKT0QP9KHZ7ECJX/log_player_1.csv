Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer still allows me to make a profit, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly better than John's. While I'd prefer more, I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
