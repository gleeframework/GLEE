Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. However, it's still a reasonable price considering the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $145 is better than my minimum, I'm not eager to accept such a low offer. I'll counter and try to push for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $165. This shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure how much more I can push the negotiation.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, he may lower his offer further or I might end up with a less desirable outcome."
