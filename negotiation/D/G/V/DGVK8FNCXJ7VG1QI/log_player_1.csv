Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a better price. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80, so I have a safety net. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident that I can still get a good price for this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  $85 is a better deal than selling to John for $80."
