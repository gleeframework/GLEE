Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if it's just John) creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to hesitate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
