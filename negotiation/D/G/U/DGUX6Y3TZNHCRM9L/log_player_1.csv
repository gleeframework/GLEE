Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting.

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'll see if I can squeeze out a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really like the product and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. Considering our previous discussions, would you be open to discussing $10,550 as a potential price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,550

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I've been negotiating for a while now, and Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  $10,550 is a reasonable compromise and gets me closer to my desired price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $10,000."
