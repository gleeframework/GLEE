"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget and he can get the same product from John for much less.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if they can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to go up to $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is close to his maximum price. This is a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  He wants to make it clear that he is serious about buying the product, but he is not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $11,750 is still too high for him, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

Bob is pushing a bit harder this time. He's offering a price closer to his budget, but still leaving some room for a possible compromise. He's also signaling to Alice that this is his final offer, putting pressure on her to accept or risk losing the deal."
