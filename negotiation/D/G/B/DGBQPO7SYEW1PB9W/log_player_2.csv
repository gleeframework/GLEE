"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. After considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from using the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, she's likely willing to come down a bit more. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! The product looks great, but I was hoping to get it for a little less. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also puts us in a good position to potentially reach a final price closer to $7,000, which would be a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $7,500 is getting closer to an acceptable price. However, I still believe there's room to negotiate a slightly better deal. We're in round 3 of 10, so there's no rush to settle just yet. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $7,100? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 7100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer inches closer to Alice's price while still leaving room for a final compromise around $7,000. By proposing a specific number, it shows I'm serious about purchasing the product but want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to the price I was hoping to get. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that this is her bottom line. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is minimal at this point. Accepting this offer secures a good deal at $7,200, saving me $2,800 from John's price.  It's always possible to get a slightly better deal, but this is a strong outcome, and I'm happy to finalize the purchase."
