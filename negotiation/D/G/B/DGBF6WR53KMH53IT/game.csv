"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still above my comfortable price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This shows my commitment to acquiring the product, while still ensuring the deal is mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,225,000?  This reflects a compromise that acknowledges the product's true value while bringing us closer to a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. I believe this offer fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
