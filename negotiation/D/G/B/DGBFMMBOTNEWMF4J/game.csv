"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
